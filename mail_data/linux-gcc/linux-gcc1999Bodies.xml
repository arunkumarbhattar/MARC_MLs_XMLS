The "reboot" function fails on Linux/Alpha.  The problem is due to type
promotion rules.  The constant 0xfee1dead exceeds the range for (int), and
is promoted to (unsigned int).  The INLINE_SYSCALL passes (long), so the
value is zero-extended to 64 bits and passed in a register.  The kernel
code specifies (int), and expects sign-extension to 64 bits.  The magic
match fails.  The following corrects this for me.  (I think that the large
constants for the "howto" parameter are handled by the prototype, although
I haven't checked for this.)

Hi!
Can I write programs in Assembler under Linux ?
Or doesn't the Kernel allow that ?

Let's say I want to dynamically allocate some memory to an object that
I am creating using malloc(). Traditionally I do the following:

  ObjectType *objectpointer;  /* Decl. of pointer to object */

  objectpointer = (ObjectType *)malloc(sizeof(ObjectType));

My question. Do I really need to add the type cast (ObjectType *)
before the call to malloc() ?

Traditionally I have always been taught to include the cast. However, 
some references say that a cast was ONLY required in earlier versions
of C prior to standard ANSI C. Nonetheless I always type cast as that
is how I have done it for years and years. Do I really need the cast?
More precisely, do I really need the cast using gcc?

You don't *need* the cast, but it will produce a warning, since malloc
returns a void pointer.  I would get in the habbit of using the cast.

ISO C++ requires the cast.  See 4.10 (p60) and C.1.2.6 (p689) of
the standard.  If someone wants to compile this in C++ (for some
unknown reason), the compiler should refuse to accept it without
the cast.  For justification, consider what would happen in
overloading and template parameter matching.

Hey all,

    Perhaps this is slightly off topic, and if so, my apologies.  I've run into
    a bit of a problem trying to compile gcc v2.8.1

    I'm currently using v2.7.2.3  After I dl'ed 2.8.1 I ran the configure
    for my host with the options:

    --prefix=/usr
    --build=i586-linux-gnu
    --with-gnu-ld
    --with-gnu-as
    --with-elf
    --enable-c-cpplib
    --enable-threads=posix

    AFAIK this info is correct.  I then proceeded to [make LANGUAGES=c];
    however, the output always cops out with the following:

   gcc -b   -DIN_GCC   -DUSE_GNULIBC_1 -g  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H    -I. -I. -I./config
\
  -DGCC_INCLUDE_DIR=\"/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1/2.8.1/include\" \

version.c
ld: cannot open -lgcc: No such file or directory
make: *** [version.o] Error 1

    For whatever reason I *cannot* seem to make the compiler recognize the gcc
libraries.  I can't even find
    a def for the [-lgcc] in the Makefile.  How might I go about correcting this
problem?

    Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.


Thanks.  Matt

You won't find -lgcc in the Makefile.  It is implicit.  You can suppress
it with -nodefaultlibs or -nostdlib, but I don't think you want to do
that.  It is, as it were, the compiler's own library, it lives where the
compiler was built, and the compiler should know where to find it.

Hmmm.  Are you trying to build gcc-2.8.1 in the same place gcc-2.7.2.3
lives?  I don't think that will work.  It wouldn't surprise me if
./configure deleted your libgcc.a..- but no, the last dir in the path
name is the gcc version number, so it shouldn't do that.  Likewise for
the spec file...

Well, do gcc -v, and wherever it reads the specs from, in the same dir
there should be a libgcc.a.  If it's there, I guess you could copy it to
/lib or so, or give the path with -L.  If it's not, I don't know what to
tell you short of reinstall gcc-2.7.2.3.

I will probably try something like this soon.  Do you know of a patch
file to get from gcc-2.7.2.3 to 2.8.x ?? :-)

What right track are you on, and what steps hav you taken on it? :-)

I am sorry, I didn't notice the -DUSE_GNULIBC_1 before.  It should tell
you in README or INSTALL or so if this is true, but it is my impression
that gcc-2.8.1 wants to be linked with glibc-2 AKA libc-6.  crt1.o is a
standard startfile, that is the entry point when you make an executable
(and the startfiles for libc-5 and -6 are not compatible) but I don't
know where it came from.  You didn't ask it to make an executable.  you
asked it (-c) to take version.c and make version.o.  Also, I don't know
where -b came from.  That is normally used to specify a target for a
cross-compile, and I have never seen it used without an argument.
I just assumed you had glibc-2.  If you do, I would get the
gcc-2.7.2.3-glibc.bin.tar.gz from metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC.  That
is what I did when Wine-990131 broke the gcc-2.7.2.3 I had compiled and
linked with libc-5.0.9 (it was all I had at the time) and it has worked
fine ever since.  If you don't.. well, the README or INSTALL should tell
you if you need it, but sometimes those things _do_ go on.  :-)

Interesting.  I just made a program baz.c: int baz(){} and compiled it
with gcc -c baz.c.  No diagnostics.  gcc -b -c baz.c gave me

gcc: installation problem, cannot exec `cc1': No such file or directory

gcc -o my baz.c gave

/usr/lib/crt1.o(.text+0x36): undefined reference to `main'

Something is wrong, but I am not on site, and not really all that far
beyond the "hello World" level myself.  H.J??

I hope this is some use to you.

No.  malloc() returns a void * which is automatically converted to the
correct type upon assignment.  In general, you can assign to and from
void pointers without loss of information.

&gt; Traditionally I have always been taught to include the cast. However, 
&gt; some references say that a cast was ONLY required in earlier versions

The cast was required in pre-ANSI days.

I have lost track of why I think this, but I _think_ you need to put a

thanks lawson-

i found libgcc.a and libgcc2.a, but libgcc.so doesn't seem to appear
anywhere in the distribution i have.

egcs is useless for anything but a kernel build until i can solve this.

&gt;Traditionally I have always been taught to include the cast. However, 
&gt;some references say that a cast was ONLY required in earlier versions
&gt;of C prior to standard ANSI C. Nonetheless I always type cast as that
&gt;is how I have done it for years and years. Do I really need the cast?
&gt;More precisely, do I really need the cast using gcc?

As far as I know, the theory is :

- KNR C: explicit cast needed
- ANSI C: no explicit cast
- C++: explicit cast needed

In KNR C, malloc() used to return (char *). So the explicit cast was
necessary (to avoid warnings).

In ANSI, malloc() returns (void *) and the rule is that (void *) can be
implicitly cast to (anything *) without a warning. So an explicit cast
is useless.

In C++, the rule is that you cannot cast (void *) to (anything *)
implicitly so you have to cast explicitly (in fact, you're not
supposed to use malloc() at all).

Although, in ANSI C, an explicit cast does no harm, it's useless. I
think it's best to leave it off if only because if you change the
type of the recipient pointer from (foo *) to (bar *), you don't want
to have to change all occurrences of = (foo *) malloc() by
= (bar *) malloc().

That habit of writing (type *) malloc () is just a leftover from
pre-ANSI days. Nowadays, it makes about as much sense as writing
int n = (int) 42;

#include &lt;warning/iamnotanexpert.h&gt;

PS: It would be even better to use
 objectpointer = malloc (sizeof *objectpointer);

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi!
&gt; &gt; Can I write programs in Assembler under Linux ?
&gt; &gt; Or doesn't the Kernel allow that ?

  Thanks for your Answer, but is there a special syntax or is everything like a
normal DOS-Assembler?

Yes, you can write them in any language you like.  The kernel doesn't care.

Hello !!!

Can somedoy please tell me why I'm getting this strange results in my
program:

Please enter the students name: testing
Please enter the students name: Please enter the students name: Please
enter the students name: Please enter the students name: Please enter the
students name:
Please enter the students name: Please enter the students name: Please
enter the students name: Please enter the students name:


and here is the code:

#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;cctype&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
        int student[10];
        int student_count = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while(count &lt; 10)
        {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter the students name: ";
                cin &gt;&gt; student[student_count++];

                count++;
        }

        return 0;
}

I'm getting the same results if I use do while loop. Please help me,
because this is driving me crazy.

								Bye.

No assembler does not mean direct-hardware access.
All programming language ends-up being machine code, whether this machine   
code has been manually entered in binary form by an human or is the   
result of an ascii text passed through a C compiler or an assembler makes   
no difference to the kernel.

No. You are using the CPU, that's right. But that's what every program
does. A program can be an assembler program (and every program even C
programs are translated to assembler) without direct hardware access. To
do something useful you would have to call kernel routines though.

be careful to the difference between kernel space and user space.
Application execute in the lowest operating modality, while kernel
executes in supervisor mode (the highest level)

Greetings.  I am currently running gcc 2.7.2.3 trying to upgrade to

error:

cpp: Usage: /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2.3/cpp [switches] input

I tried installing 2.8.0 first, same error.  The gcc I'm currently
running is the one that came with the distribution I installed
(slackware 3.6)

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Hello guys,
 this might be considered slightly offtopic, but since gcc was ported to
SPARC architecture, I wonder if anyone could share pointers (or the right
place to ask) to papers/documentation describing details of sparc
architecture (stack frames, register/memory/instructions management etc..)

best regards

No, only using -g is required.  The debug information is only used by the
debugger, during normal execution it will not be touched in any way.  The
only possible performance reduction with -g is caused by the fact that it's
advisable to compile everything with an optimizatin of at most -O1 and
on some architectures like the i386 to avoid code generation options like
-fomit-frame-pointer when using a debugger.  That loss is typically not
very hard.

&gt; I'm not concerned about disk space.

Then there is no reason not to build everything with debugging enabled.

1. egcs-1.1.1.diff.4.gz adds fcomi/fucom support for PPro.
2. egcs-1.1.1.diff.5.gz makes C binaries smaller without unnecessary

&gt; in your patches the /usr/include/g++ dir was renamed to

Did you apply all my changes in egcs-1.1.1.diff.1? It modifies many

Hi,

I'd like to release it to public this weekend. Please give it a try.
BTW, from now on, ftp.veresearch.com and ftp.kernel.org will be only 
primary ftp sites for binutils.

Thanks.

This should be final release for binutils 2.9.1.0.x based on binutils
2.9.1. I am planning to release to public this weekend. Please test it
as much as you can. Thanks.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.1.0.23 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 2.9.1 plus Linux/ARM support, some x86 assembler
changes, some PPC bug fixes, some alpha bug fixes and an exception
frame optimization bug fix.

Due to the exception frame optimization bug fix, it is highly
recommended that you recompile all your C++ codes. Otherwise,
exception handling may not work right when an exception is thrown.

Since I no longer have machine running libc 5, starting from this
release, there will be no pre-compiled binaries for libc 5.

There was some problem on Linux/alpha. The binaries generated by the
new binituls may not run correctly on Linux/alpha. It turned out it was
a bug in the alpha dynamic linker in glibc 2.0.6. The current glibc 2.1
and glibc 2.0.7 should be ok.

This release should work on linux/x86/alpha. There are some ELF bug
fixes. But I don't know if it fixes all the bugs reported on
linux/sparc, Linux/MIPS and linux/PPC. I'd like to hear reports on them.
I'd like to release it to public soon. Please test it as much as you
can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.1.0.23 to hjl@lucon.org.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.22:

1. Fix i386 disassembler for fwait.
2. Add "-j section" for objcopy.
3. Bug fix for linker. It should work for Linux/PPC now.
4. Add armlinux_vec for ARM/ELF.
5. Update gas documation for i386.
6. Bug fixes for Sparc/ELF.
7. Bug fixes for IBM 370.
8. Added gas documation for IBM 370.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.21:

1. Add Pentium III support.

IMPORTANT:
The .plt format that the Alpha was using was not thread safe.  So I 
changed it.  The new format is *not* binary compatible with the old,
thus you must use glibc 2.0.4 to get an ld.so that can understand it.

Note that the new ld.so knows how to deal with the old .plt format, so
old libraries will still work, but they should be relinked eventually
for performance reasons.

The file list:

1. binutils-2.9.1.0.23.tar.gz. Source code.
2. binutils-2.9.1.0.22b-2.9.1.0.23.diff.gz. Patch against the previous
   beta source code.
3. binutils-2.9.1.0.23-glibc.x86.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/x86 binaries
   for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above).
4. binutils-2.9.1.0.23-alpha.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/alpha binaries
   for glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above.
5. binutils.spec. A RPM spec file for RedHat 5.2.

The primary ftp sites for the Linux binutils are:

1. ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils
2. ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc

The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.
 
To install the binary package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do
 
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.23-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
or
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.23-alpha.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
 
to see what is in there.
 
Please do back up before you remove things.

To install for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.5c or above), PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. rm -f /usr/bin/encaps /usr/bin/nm
4. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.23-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
5. ldconfig
 
Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin. You have to use
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/as
 
and
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux
 
if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.
 
To install for alpha, PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.23-alpha.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
4. ldconfig
 
I have changed the target names for Linux/x86 and Linux/x86 (a.out)
to ix86-linux and ix86-linuxaout respectively. The precompiled
binaries are installed under /usr/ix86-linux and /usr/ix86-linuxaout.
You should make appropriate symbolic links if you have a different
name for the Linux/x86 target, like i586-unknown-linux.

The target name for Linux/alpha is alpha-linux. The precompiled alpha
binaries are installed under /usr/alpha-linux. You should make
appropriate symbolic links if you have a different name for the
Linux/alpha target, like alpha-redhat-linux.

If you have an old linux library in the a.out format and you cannot
obtain the newer version in the ELF format for whatever reason, you
can try "objcopy --remove-leading-char" on the a.out library and see
if it can link with your code in ELF.

Thanks.

The following patch was necessary to convince connection.c in 
ORBit (gnome's orb, from cvs) to build with an egcs from cvs.  

I have yet to prune down the code to a reasonable example; every
time I have a small example, it compiles.  Color me confused.  
I'll work on that some more rsn, but I've stuck the error at the 
end of the message in case someone can immediately tell what's 
wrong.  (Yes, I know, this isn't the egcs list, but maybe this 
will follow the same path as __builtin_const_p.)

I'm not sure why the &amp;s were included.  The two arguments in 
question already overlap the stated inputs, so they shouldn't be 
necessary, right?

Hi,

I am preparing for egcs 1.1.1 for Linux. I will include patches in

ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/egcs/1.1.1

I have tested them extensively on x86 and alpha. Please give it a
try. If I don't hear any complaints, I will release it in a week.

BTW, some of them are back ported from the egcs snapshot. I have
submitted the rest to egcs. They may or may not show up in the
future egcs. If you don't like any of those, please let me know.

Thanks.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/egcs/1.1.1
&gt; 
&gt; What gives with the patches in the directory?  Are the all independent

Yes, they are independent to each other.

&gt; and therefore all of them need to be applied?  Two of them are only
&gt; readable by the owner and so I can't ftp them.

Ooops. Fixed.

Debugging symbols have no effect at all on the performance.  They do
not get loaded (except from debuggers, of course) so also the memory
consumption does not change.  It is alsways a stupid idea to strip
binaries.

There should be no code difference.  Only extra (non-executable)
sections added to the executable so it just takes up more space on disk.

There is a small hook or two, but I believe all you need is an
uptodate gdb for that.  The only that really requires recompilation,
and performance impact is profiling.

&gt; I'm not concerned about disk space.

This is my totally non-technical response, based completely on just my
own observations, so I could be dead wrong, however:

I've noticed no slowdown whatsoever running apps under gdb, nor running a
version compiled with -g vs one without.  The things that make a major
difference are optimization flags and disk footprint.  In the first case,
I mean using -O2 or -O3 vs no optimization.  Normally if you want to be
able to debug something, you want to leave optimizations off, since
they tend to mangle up the code and make it difficult to step through.
However, the optimizations in egcs have gotten so good that *not*
using them can literally mean doubling your execution time.  So there's
a tradeoff there.
The other big on is the disk space.  Debugging symbols are huge,
frequently several times the size of the executable itself.  An example
is the latest WINE executable; with debugging info it's like 5 megs,
without it's just over 2.  The load time of the program is *signifigantly*
sped up by striping the executable, since it has less than half as much
data to drag off the disk.

Hope that helps.

Hi All linux expert,
I setup a sendmail (8.8.7) as MTA and connected to another PC run
windows95. my intention is to build a filtering sendmail MTA. I know
that current sendmail.cf be able to do some of the filtering feature,
but feature like filtering out or drop the packets that with IP address
or user name and domain that we want to set will not available in
sendmail.cf file, am I right? I do not know whether this be able to do
it using procmail? Do you have that kind of source code in c++ that can
share with me?
The feature is :-
1) be able to look through the packet IP adress, user name or domain,
and drop the packet if failed the condition we set.
2) look for attachment file that are MIME or Java script and drop the
mail.
Thanks in advance. I hope I can steal a bit of your time.
Best regards CS Law

I don't know how ccmalloc works, but Electric Fence uses the 
processor hardware to detect illegal memory accesses.  By default,
its memory allocations are page aligned, so, small overruns are
not detected.  Try setting EF_ALIGNMENT=0 in the shell and see
if you can detect the clobber.  EF_PROTECT_BELOW=1 will catch
buffer underruns.

&gt; I've also created wrappers for malloc/realloc/free, which logged what 
&gt; they werre doing. And nothing. The program sigsegv'ed on realloc() when 
&gt; reallocating block of (re)allocated previously memory (of certain size).
&gt; Gdb said that all those faults came from libc_free...

Are you compiling with "-ggdb"?

EHLO!

What can cause a segmentation fault? Things, which I'm aware of, are 
checked, and they are
-incorrect malloc/realloc/free operations
-bad hardware
-a bug in libc

To make clear of what I'm talking about:
I wrote a program (info viewer -- pinfo), and in two functions I get 
segmentation faults. I've checked it on few machines, running 
different operating systems, and the result was always the same.
I also run the program compiled with -lefence, and after that I also 
tried with -lccmalloc. The result was that the segmentation faults 
didn't occur at all.
I've also created wrappers for malloc/realloc/free, which logged what 
they werre doing. And nothing. The program sigsegv'ed on realloc() when 
reallocating block of (re)allocated previously memory (of certain size).
Gdb said that all those faults came from libc_free...

So? I'm really confused,  I think I'll become grey because of this ;)
And on my side, I'll take a closer look at the free() sources...

If libfoo.so might be used by/useful to a program written in some other
language, it would be kind of the library developer to link libfoo.so
with -lc.  This just adds the soname libc.so.6 so ld and ld.so know how
to resolve lobfoo.so's references.  I think in general it is a good idea
for a shared library  to be linked with any other shared library it
depends on.

There are other ways to work it, but this seems to me to be the most
straighforward.

I have been trying for a couple of weeks now to compile a program that 
consists of a C++ main function which calls a C function. I have tried 
using the -c option to compile object code for both files using gcc and 
g++, then linking them together (I've trued using both gcc and g++ to 
link the object code). However when I try the final link together I get 
an error saying that there was an undefined reference to the C function 
in the main function. 

Here is the test code I have been using (I know there is no reason why 
I can't compile them both as C or C++ but they are not the functions I 
need to compile, only test ones. It makes sense to me. The final code I 
create will involve RPC calls which I can only get working in C)

//C++ main function called main.cc
extern void funky(void);

void main()
{
  funky();
};

//C function called funky.c
void funky()
{
  int x;
  x = 0;
};


The commands I used were
g++ -c main.cc
gcc -c funky.c
g++ main.o funky.o -o prog

I am sorry to bother you with this question but I don't know who else 
to try, even my leactures at university don't know how to achieve this.

Hi, I think I am tracking a bug in egcs that appears not to 
exist in gcc.  Its a little beyond my abilities to solve, so 
I am not sure how to ask for help.  

I am compiling a routine that manipulates strings (actually, vsprintf,
from the linux kernel).  It looks something like this:

void vsprintf (... char *ptr ... ) {
   ...
   while (...) {
      ++ptr;
      ...
      if ('%' == *ptr) ...
   }
}

where ... == dozens of lines of code.  The compiler appears to be
generating code that 'forgets' that the ptr was incremented back
when, and pulls an old, unincremented value out of the stack.
(Alternately, it forgot to write the new value back into the stack...)

I can make the bug go away by modifying as follows:

void vsprintf (... char *aaaptr ... ) {
char * ptr = aaaptr;
...}

and then everything works right ...

From what I can tell, this bug occurs in egcs-1.1.1 and 1.1.2 but not gcc-2.8.1
(when compiled with -O2) (although I'm still checking).  The back end is
the i370 back end which is identical for egcs and gcc. So I figure the back 
end must not be at fault :-) And of course, linux vsprintf is known to work ...
so it would appear to be something funky that the optimizer is doing.

Anyone care to help me crack this?

You might want to try prototyping the C funct. BEFORE it is called.
This worked for me when I had the same probs.

Hi.

I have such problem:

$ gcc -fPIC -o foo.o foo.c
$ gcc -shared -o libfoo.so libfoo.o
$ ldd -r libfoo.so
      statically linked
undefined symbol: printf    ()
...
Program, that uses libfoo's functions linked against libc.so.6.
It works well.

libfoo uses printf (and other functions) from libc, but gcc doesn't
link shared libraries against libc.so.6 by default.

Question. Does shared library needs to be linked against the libraries,
functions from it uses?

You might want to look at newusers.  Pay extra attention to the cautions

Hi everybody,
	I also upgraded my RedHat from version 5.0 to version 5.2 some days

Subject: RedHat upgrade


Hello everybody,

I upgraded my RedHat from version 5.0 to version 5.2 some days ago.
Everything seemed to be going fine but yesteday I found the problem.

I can't compile, link and run a application written in C that worked
correctly in the previous version. This is the log:

1) First time I tried to compile and link it after a few changes in its
code I got the link error: undefined reference to the function fmod().
This functions is called from a module I had not changed for months.

2) I changed the Makefile and compiled the application with -lm in order
to link libm library and the compilation/link was ok.

3) When I run this version I got a segmentation fault that I had never
got.

4) I thought that the problem could be in the new changes and after a
long time looking for the problem I decided to restore a previous
backup. This backups contains the original code and the orirginal
Makefile.

5) I tried to compile and link again and I got the same link error:
undefined reference to the function fmod().

6) I decided to compile and link this version in a RedHat 5.0 box and
the result is ok.

Any help?

Please, reply to my address. I'm not a member of the list.
Thanks in advance,

Hello,

I would like to be able to change the embedded rpath in executable and
shared libraries using libbfd.  The development platform in question here
is linux/i386.

[ I was also thinking of using something similar (presuming it's possible)
to change the NEEDED tags for redhat glibc-2.1 built executables so that
they can be run on non-redhat glibc-2.1 distributions.   Redhat 6.0 has
used a different SONAME for it's glibc-2.1 built libstdc++.so.2.9.0 then
any of the other glibc-2.1distributions, so ISVs and other external package
creators will have to build separate executables/packages for redhat
glibc-2.1 and for any other glibc-2.1 based distributions if they use C++.
The other possibilty would be for everybody to ship their own libstdc++
(and use -Wl,-rpath to force it to be used instead of the system one) so
that their binaries will work on different distributions.  However, I am
not sure this is feasable because of the GPL. ]

Based on objdump, and some of the libbfd elf code I wrote the program below
that can be used to find the RPATH start in the ELF .dynamic section, but
now that I have found it I don't know how to write modifications back into
the section.  I tried bfd_openw instead of bfd_openr, but the code to find
the RPATH doesn't work after doing that (the bfd_check_format_matches call
fails).

Can anybody provide me with some hints for the next step.

The easiest way to do this is to make a new copy of the
executable/library, and change what you want changed while you are about
it.  Bear in mind, though, that RedHat might have had a _reason_ for
changing the soname - possibly their libstdc++.so.2.9.0 is incompatible
in some way?  I'd look in the patchfiles (They're included in the SRPM)
and see if they give or imply any reason any reason they changed it - at
least before distributing libraries with modified sonames. :-)

&gt; From: peeterj@ca.ibm.com

&gt; I would like to be able to change the embedded rpath in executable and
&gt; shared libraries using libbfd.  The development platform in question here
&gt; is linux/i386.

_Changing_ is a little tricky, but the attached program strips rpaths
from executables (I find it essential for debugging the binutils).
It's endian-dependent, if you want this for x86 you can just change
the occurrences of 'MSB' to 'LSB' and compile (I should really fix
that).

In 5.2 . isn't in your path as default.  This is a nice little securty
measure but it does mean that you have to type ./a.out.  Also check to see
if it has execute permission and run file on it to see if it is and
executable file.

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; 	I also upgraded my RedHat from version 5.0 to version 5.2 some days
&gt; ago.
&gt; After this mail I tried to compile my c programs.The program has been
&gt; compiled
&gt; but the executable is not running.
&gt; Suppose if a.out is the executable then on typing a.out I get the message:
&gt; bash: a.out :command not found.
&gt; Any help?
&gt; Thanks.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; I upgraded my RedHat from version 5.0 to version 5.2 some days ago.
&gt; Everything seemed to be going fine but yesteday I found the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't compile, link and run a application written in C that worked
&gt; correctly in the previous version. This is the log:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) First time I tried to compile and link it after a few changes in its
&gt; code I got the link error: undefined reference to the function fmod().
&gt; This functions is called from a module I had not changed for months.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) I changed the Makefile and compiled the application with -lm in order
&gt; to link libm library and the compilation/link was ok.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) When I run this version I got a segmentation fault that I had never
&gt; got.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) I thought that the problem could be in the new changes and after a
&gt; long time looking for the problem I decided to restore a previous
&gt; backup. This backups contains the original code and the orirginal
&gt; Makefile.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) I tried to compile and link again and I got the same link error:
&gt; undefined reference to the function fmod().
&gt; 
&gt; 6) I decided to compile and link this version in a RedHat 5.0 box and
&gt; the result is ok.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help?
&gt; 
&gt; Please, reply to my address. I'm not a member of the list.

I guess I have been barrking up the wrong tree, then. :-)  I don't
understand how RH 5.0 is able to resolve fmod() without -lm.

The includes are really _part_ of the library, but that doesn't help
much with a bundled set like glibc.  I'm sorry, I don't know where to
look for doco on that.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello again,
&gt; 
&gt; After sendind the original message I mounted my src directory on a
&gt; RedHat5.0 box, remade the changes and compiled them. The application is
&gt; running since then. I didn't use -lm in te makefile. By the way: if I
&gt; link the libm I get segmentation fault in the RedHat5.0.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand: where could I find information about what libraries

- accessing a malloced area after free has been called

 &gt; -bad hardware

 &gt; To make clear of what I'm talking about:

 &gt; I also run the program compiled with -lefence, and after that I also

 &gt; didn't occur at all.
 &gt; I've also created wrappers for malloc/realloc/free, which logged what

 &gt; Gdb said that all those faults came from libc_free...
Looks really like a malloc problem.  Run your application with
MALLOC_CHECK_=1 or 2 in the environment to call some malloc self
checks (this works with glibc2 and AFAIK also with later libc5
versions).


 &gt; So? I'm really confused,  I think I'll become grey because of this ;)
 &gt; And on my side, I'll take a closer look at the free() sources...

Better check your code first, the malloc source should be ok.

Andreas


P.S. From the glibc2 manual:
Another possibility to check for and guard against bugs in the use of
@code{malloc}, @code{realloc} and @code{free} is to set the environment
variable @code{MALLOC_CHECK_}.  When @code{MALLOC_CHECK_} is set, a
special (less efficient) implementation is used which is designed to be
tolerant against simple errors, such as double calls of @code{free} with
the same argument, or overruns of a single byte (off-by-one bugs).  Not
all such errors can be proteced against, however, and memory leaks can
result.  If @code{MALLOC_CHECK_} is set to @code{0}, any detected heap
corruption is silently ignored; if set to @code{1}, a diagnostic is
printed on @code{stderr}; if set to @code{2}, @code{abort} is called
immediately.  This can be useful because otherwise a crash may happen
much later, and the true cause for the problem is then very hard to
track down.

You might also try using mpr.

-ggdb adds some gdb specific symbols that make it easier to track down

&gt; I don't know how ccmalloc works, but Electric Fence uses the  
&gt; processor hardware to detect illegal memory accesses.  By default, 
&gt; its memory allocations are page aligned, so, small overruns are 
&gt; not detected.  Try setting EF_ALIGNMENT=0 in the shell and see 
&gt; if you can detect the clobber.  EF_PROTECT_BELOW=1 will catch

When running efence? I'll try.

Are you using libc5?  In that case, you've give the wrong build
system. i586-linux-gnu means build for glibc2.  Just remove the
--build option and let config.guess find out the name of your system
(it will report something like i586-linux-gnulibc1).

I think libgcc2.so is what I was trying to remember.  You said "the load

but can't at run time:  there is some discrepancy between the paths it
feeds to ld, and to ld.so:  Possibly LD_LIBRARY_PATH or -rpath-link is
more inclusive than /etc/ld.so.conf/ LD_RUN_PATH/ -rpath/ -L?  Running
the build with --verbose might give you a clue...Hang on!  I have been
barking up the wrong tree.  I have binutils-2.9.1.0.23, which should be
about what is in egcs.. and __register_frame_info is undefined in ld,
and in libbfd-2.9.1.0.23.  But it works fine for me, for all I only have
glibc-2.0.6, and the notes said I needed 2.0.7.  ldd /usr/bin/ld just
lists libc.so.6 and ld-linux.so.2, but I can't find that symbol in any
library.
I tried to use libdl on libbfd, but it fails with undefined symbol
_hex_value.  I dummied that, but dlsym just gives undefined symbol for
__register_frame_info.  Cheers!  I am now as stumped as you, if not
more.  Perhaps we need glibc-2.0.7?  Know where I can find a
glibc-2.0.6-2.0.7.diff.gz?  I have mail only access, and it would take a
month to get the whole tarball, and I have 2.0.6. :-).

Przemek&gt; Where do you have it from? Looks a bit better than the libc.info...
&gt;From the glibc 2.1 memory.texi file which is the source for libc.info.

That's not necessary, but it is a good idea, especially if you want
people to be able to use your library on machines with multiple
incompatible versions of libraries on which it depends (for instance
libc5 and libc6/glibc2)

EHLO!

I did it! :))) All works fine now.
It was all caused by a tiny bug -- a ptr[strlen(ptr)-1] assignment 
without checking for the strlen value first :-Q
Anyway thanks for your help, I learned a bit about different debiggung 
methods :)

you'll have to include the definition in ur c++ prog within the extern
statements braces ...

extern "C" {
	extern void funky(void);
}

this is because C++ appends info redgarding the argument types to the fn
name, so that overloading and the likes can be performed. this is called
name mangling if u want the correct terms. by using the extern "C" you
tell the compiler to cut the name mangling from your fn as it has been
compiled externally from the C++ compiler, and thus has no such info.
regarding the argument types.

Hello,


        While compiling new glibc 2.1 i got this error:

        The FAQ that comes with glibc-2.1 package says something about
versioning problems. Do i need to recompile rpcgen?? Another question: rpcgen
comes with binutils package, right? :-)


        Thanks

My tools: gcc-2.8.1 and the latest binutils release (when it was still
available at sunsite!).
My situation: upgrading glibc-2.0.6.

&gt; Anyone care to help me crack this?

What you should do is write a bug report to
egcs-bugs@egcs.cygnus.com. Make sure it is 'complete', according to
the 'reporting bugs' section of gcc.info. In this case, provide
original source (preprocessed), assembler output, and an indication of
why you think the assembler output is incorrect.

If you want to analyse it yourself: invoke cc1 with -da, and look at
the various RTL dumps produced.

Hope this helps,
Martin

Dear all,
     I found it was very difficult to debug stl, for example, I can not
print a value like this:

&gt;&gt;print *i
&gt;&gt;print (*i).value

The commands before are all error in dbx(SGI).
Do someone has good suggestion?

        Well, i'm sending mail to this list because GNATS at GNU website is
"Out of Order", i couldn't find information about this problem searching
through the net, i already looked at the FAQ that comes with the package
dozens of times, i already reinstalled binutils, ld.so, and egcs too, and, i'm
a little "green" with C programming. *&lt;8-)

        I guess this problem is related to ld.so, but i'm not really sure. 

        The problem: while compiling glibc-2.1 i got this "undefined

This should be final release for binutils 2.9.1.0.x based on binutils
2.9.1. I am planning to release to public this weekend. Please test it
as much as you can. Thanks.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.1.0.24 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 2.9.1 plus Linux/ARM support, some x86 assembler
changes, some PPC bug fixes, some alpha bug fixes and an exception
frame optimization bug fix.

Due to the exception frame optimization bug fix, it is highly
recommended that you recompile all your C++ codes. Otherwise,
exception handling may not work right when an exception is thrown.

Since I no longer have machine running libc 5, starting from this
release, there will be no pre-compiled binaries for libc 5.

There was some problem on Linux/alpha. The binaries generated by the
new binituls may not run correctly on Linux/alpha. It turned out it was
a bug in the alpha dynamic linker in glibc 2.0.6. The current glibc 2.1
and glibc 2.0.7 should be ok.

This release should work on linux/x86/alpha. There are some ELF bug
fixes. But I don't know if it fixes all the bugs reported on
linux/sparc, Linux/MIPS and linux/PPC. I'd like to hear reports on them.
I'd like to release it to public soon. Please test it as much as you
can.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.4:

1. 2 x86 16bit mode assembler bugs, "ret" and "movb $35,0x4(%di)", are
fixed.

IMPORTANT:
The .plt format that the Alpha was using was not thread safe.  So I 
changed it.  The new format is *not* binary compatible with the old,
thus you must use glibc 2.0.4 to get an ld.so that can understand it.

Note that the new ld.so knows how to deal with the old .plt format, so
old libraries will still work, but they should be relinked eventually
for performance reasons.

The file list:

1. binutils-2.9.1.0.24.tar.gz. Source code.
2. binutils-2.9.1.0.23-2.9.1.0.24.diff.gz. Patch against the previous
   beta source code.
3. binutils-2.9.1.0.24-glibc.x86.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/x86 binaries
   for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above).
4. binutils-2.9.1.0.24-alpha.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/alpha binaries
   for glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above.
5. binutils.spec. A RPM spec file for RedHat 5.2.

The primary ftp sites for the Linux binutils are:

1. ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils
2. ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc

The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.
 
To install the binary package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do
 
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.24-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
or
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.24-alpha.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
 
to see what is in there.
 
Please do back up before you remove things.

To install for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above), PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. rm -f /usr/bin/encaps /usr/bin/nm
4. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.24-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
5. ldconfig
 
Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin. You have to use
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/as
 
and
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux
 
if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.
 
To install for alpha, PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.24-alpha.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
4. ldconfig
 
I have changed the target names for Linux/x86 and Linux/x86 (a.out)
to ix86-linux and ix86-linuxaout respectively. The precompiled
binaries are installed under /usr/ix86-linux and /usr/ix86-linuxaout.
You should make appropriate symbolic links if you have a different
name for the Linux/x86 target, like i586-unknown-linux.

The target name for Linux/alpha is alpha-linux. The precompiled alpha
binaries are installed under /usr/alpha-linux. You should make
appropriate symbolic links if you have a different name for the
Linux/alpha target, like alpha-redhat-linux.

If you have an old linux library in the a.out format and you cannot
obtain the newer version in the ELF format for whatever reason, you
can try "objcopy --remove-leading-char" on the a.out library and see
if it can link with your code in ELF.

Thanks.

What's the best/easiest to understand what the different between
REL and RELA is in the binutils bfd, and also how people implement 
.got and .plt sections?  Neither the gas info docs, nor the bfd info
docs seem to cover these topics.

I am trying to compile glibc on a new architecture (ES/390) and 
get a linker core dump when building ld.so This seems to be somehow
realted with the dynamic-linking code which is currently stubbed out;
I can't figure out what I need &amp; don't need to do.

BTW,  Since the ES/390 architecture only has 12-bit addresses, it
can't directly address anything outside of a 4K page.  Any wise
words on how this might affect the dynamic linker design?

Hi,

I want to override a weak symbol in a dlopen()ed object with one whose value 
is calculated on the fly by the main-line executable.

I don't see any easy way to define a new symbol in the executable's symtab, so 
I'm left with the necessity of generating a linkable object, dlopen()ing it 
first, and having the synthesised symbol definition override the weak one.

Any comments or hints would be welcome

Colin.

A couple of quickie questions:

I'm working on the i370 back end to the egcs compiler.
I want to make all loads of registers occur well before they are 
referenced, and in particular, well before they are referenced 
as base registers.

i.e. in c programs that write a-&gt;b  I want to move other 
instructions into the gap between when a is fetched &amp; a is used to 
fetch b, 

Unlike risc machines &amp; almost everything else out there, it
seems a-&gt;b needs more pipeline cycles than e.g. (a+b) or even 
if(a&gt;=b) oddly enough, unlike traditional riscs, there's no 
branch penalty, but there's a huge dereference penalty.


Nother "quickie" question:
I have to generate different instructions depending on whether 
my branch target is more than 4K bytes away.  Of course, I don't
know how far away until I've gotten further in the compilation.
What's the best way to deal with this? (I was thinking of compiling
into a temp buffer &amp; then pasting that buffer to output when done)

Hello everybody,

I upgraded my RedHat from version 5.0 to version 5.2 some days ago.
Everything seemed to be going fine but yesteday I found the problem.

I can't compile, link and run a application written in C that worked
correctly in the previous version. This is the log:

1) First time I tried to compile and link it after a few changes in its
code I got the link error: undefined reference to the function fmod().
This functions is called from a module I had not changed for months.

2) I changed the Makefile and compiled the application with -lm in order
to link libm library and the compilation/link was ok.

3) When I run this version I got a segmentation fault that I had never
got.

4) I thought that the problem could be in the new changes and after a
long time looking for the problem I decided to restore a previous
backup. This backups contains the original code and the orirginal
Makefile.

5) I tried to compile and link again and I got the same link error:
undefined reference to the function fmod().

6) I decided to compile and link this version in a RedHat 5.0 box and
the result is ok.

Any help?

Please, reply to my address. I'm not a member of the list.
Thanks in advance,

How about making the entry into the password file directly. fopen(3S) it
directly and append your entry to it as it is a simple text file. 

The password you have entered from the user (unencrypted) can be encrypted
using the crypt(3C) library function.
 If you do this you can also think about using
alternative methods for generating the salt. gettimeofday(3C) is
traditional but you can also use alternatives like gethrtime(3C).

Invoking useradd and the likes may not be such a good idea. when you can
do the above. It is much simpler too !

Try compileing your new version on a RedHat 5.0 box.

You haven't shown us a case of the same source that works on 5.0 and
fails on 5.2 yet. :-).  If it needs math.h in the source, it _should_
need -lm in the Makefile.  This sounds like a bug in 5.0 that was fixed
in 5.2.

&gt; _Changing_ is a little tricky, but the attached program strips rpaths
&gt; from executables (I find it essential for debugging the binutils).
&gt; It's endian-dependent, if you want this for x86 you can just change
&gt; the occurrences of 'MSB' to 'LSB' and compile (I should really fix
&gt; that).

Hi Geoff,

With your program as a guide (and some peeks into libbfd, elf.h, a bit
of the glibc dynamic loader code, objdump, and a hex-editor) I was able to
figure out enough to find and change the rpath string.  That was fun!

This program assumes (unlike your original program) that there is only
one DT_RPATH tag in the dynamic section as even with multiple '-Wl,-rpath,'
commands in the link this seems to occur (they all get concatonated into
a : separated path).

Thanks for your help.  If you want to use this on non-x86 you have to change
the occurances of LSB back to MSB:)

If he hasn't coded any assembler under Linux, then gcc -S will give him a
good idea of how you go about formatting it.  gcc's syntax (AT&amp;T style) is
pretty different than any assembler he's probably worked with before
(TASM, MASM, A86, MPASM, etc).  Of course, the 'Hardware-Access' bit makes
me wonder whether or not he's ever worked with any assembly at all...

Hi,

It's been rumoured that lawson_whitney@juno.com said:
&gt; 
&gt; anything useful.  You will need tcgetattr and tcsetattr and perhaps
&gt; others of the termios group (man termios) and to read the modem status,
&gt; ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &amp;msr).  I don't know where that is described in the

man termios

I have a very simple library for absolute serial-line beginers that

Hello all.

My C++ program is segfaulting in vprintf(). Since I can't see what's
wrong in the calling code, I would like to look at what's happening
in vprintf() itself. I have installed the Debian package libc6-dbg
(glibc 2.0.7) and compiled my program with 

  c++ -g *.o -o foo -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lc_g -lm -lX11

My c++ is egcs 1.0.3. The above command line works fine (no error
message). But now, my program segfaults as soon as it enters main.
ldd on it says :

  libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x40010000)
  libstdc++.so.2.8 =&gt; /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.2.8 (0x400b3000)
  libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libm.so.6 (0x400f8000)
  libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40113000)
  /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong ?

Please sign me up on your mailing list.  I am an average C programmer.  Have
programmed C using Microsoft VC 1.5 and Borland C++.  Need assists in
programming C in Linux. That is a whole new animal to tackle.  Thank you.

Todd&gt; Please respond here and to taw@pobox.com

Do you have an entry for en_us (btw. the standard form is en_US) in
/usr/share/locale?

&gt;From the glibc FAQ:

2.11.   Programs using libc have their messages translated, but other
        behavior is not localized (e.g. collating order); why?

{ZW} Translated messages are automatically installed, but the locale
database that controls other behaviors is not.  You need to run localedef to
install this database, after you have run `make install'.  For example, to
set up the French Canadian locale, simply issue the command

    localedef -i fr_CA -f ISO-8859-1 fr_CA

Please see localedata/README in the source tree for further details.

Greetings:
   I have what appears to be a strange one.  In using make to compile and
link a C program I receive the error

/usr/lib/libm.so: could not read symbols: Memory exhausted

at link time.  The puzzling aspect:  This does not happen for other
users.  As another user, the same thing goes through fine.  This is
independent of whether X11 or ASCII terminals are being used.  This is gcc
2.7.2.1 in slackware 3.2 (aka kernel 2.0.29).  Any words will be
appreciated.

            There's a version of GCC for MS-DOS, it's known by the name
of DJGPP, the main site is www.delorie.com, there you'll find links to

I'm using egcs 1.1.1.  The following code:

(line 154)
  Vector2  texEnd(float(sFontWidth[index]*2),float(-sFontHeight[index]*2));
(line 180)
  gfxCard::Draw2D(Vector2(xIter+2,pos.y-2),dimensions,fontTable[*c],texEnd);

produces the error:

text.cpp:154: parse error before `*'
text.cpp:180: no matching function for call to `gfxCard::Draw2D (Vector2,
Vector2 &amp;, Vector2 &amp;, Vector2 ()(...))'
/home/uvatha/trex/render/card.h:23: candidates are: gfxCard::Draw2D(const
Vector2 &amp;, const Vector2 &amp;, const Vector2 &amp;, const Vector2 &amp;)

However, changing line 154 to read:

 Vector2 texEnd((float)(sFontWidth[index]*2),(float)(-sFontHeight[index]*2));

Removes both of these errors.  This is not the case on at least one other
compiler I've tried.

Why?

Because the compile failed.  Take Person.h out of the compile command
(11.3.cpp #includes it anyway, so the compiler will see it) and you will
get some nice errors you can fix.  Once you fix those, you will get an
executable that says something like this when run:

Letitia Gruntfuttock
Born: 4/1/1965
Telephone: 212 5551234

Today is 3/24/1999
Today Letitia is 33 years old.

Oh, by the way, the compiler won't catch this, but you usually want to
spell the variable in the #ifndef the same way as the one in the
#define.  Normally that construction is used to protect against defining
the same thing more than once.  I don't know c++, and I have no
desire to learn it, but a compiler is a compiler.  Want the source back
with the errors fixed?

[ please cc: a copy of the reply to eeu95176@cse.iitd.ernet.in as i am not
a member of this mailing list ].

Hi,

I am writing a program (somewhat similar to irc server) that would
simultaneously open ~5000 sockets and talk to all these clients. As far as
i know a process can open only about 50-60 sockets (file descriptors). 

Will i have to open multiple processes with some form of IPC or shared
memory, or can i configure a kernel to let a process open any amount of
file descriptors. If yes, where in the kernel code should i change.

Can a 200MHz pentium take the load of a process with 5000 open file
descriptors, or will it just crash. Also which of the above 2 approaches
(single process or multiple process) will result in better utiliziation
and better stability.

What if the number of sockets is 20000 instead of 5000? ;-)

Thanx,

Lokesh.

&gt; i know a process can open only about 50-60 sockets (file descriptors). 

256 in 2.0, 1024 in 2.2

There is a patch to take 2.0 to 3000. The -ac releases (and eventually I 
hope 2.2 proper) have support for 2.2 handling very large numbers of file
handles

It wont just crash. Once you are talking 5000+ handles though it suggests
you need to look at your communication model. It may be 5000 handles is
the right answer, it may be that if you have little state and don't need
to do complex flow control you should use UDP - there are reasons ICQ
uses UDP for example

Interesting.. The errors I fixed could all have been caused by
truncation or folding, now that I look again. :-).  I guess I shouldn't
have sniped at you like that.  Well, it's no harm meant nor done, I
hope.

isomac (and lateron also annexc) needs to be compiled on the host
system.  You shouldn't remove /usr/include before running make
install.  Just ignore these errors, if you run `make install' and then
`make check' again, everything should be ok.

Btw. if you're upgrading from glibc 2.*, you don't need to remove
/usr/include - only if you're upgrading from libc5.

&gt; Why?

To cast (C style) you must put the type that you are going to in parenthesis.
I.e. From double to int:
    double d = 5.0;
    int i = (int)d;

I looked in a couple of books of mine to make sure I'm right, and I did see some
examples of something like int(d); but I've never been successful with that
method. Hopefully, soon egcs will support the ANSI Standard C++ methods of
typecasting:
e.g. Again, from int to float:
    double d = 5.0;
    int i = static_cast&lt;int&gt;d;

Anyone else?

Georg,

A modem is a character device, basically, you can access it with open(),
read(), write(), and close().  However, these are not enough to do
anything useful.  You will need tcgetattr and tcsetattr and perhaps
others of the termios group (man termios) and to read the modem status,
ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &amp;msr).  I don't know where that is described in the
doco, I just look in &lt;asm/ioctls.h&gt; when I need to know how to use it.
Msr bits are described in &lt;asm/termios.h&gt;, and they are _not_
necessarily the same bit positions as in the hardware register.

If you have info, try info [-f] libc, and read the section on low level
terminal IO.  If not, you should be able to get by with what is in man
termios and what you can find in the header files.  Grep is wonderful.

Because for Linux a standard modem is nothing but a device attached to a
serial line.  Check out the documentation about how to program serial
devices, probably /dev/ttyS&lt;some-number&gt; in your case.  The programming
model is fairly compact but has everything you need including how to deal
with carriers, slip, ppp etc.

&gt;&gt; Did you actually read what I wrote above?  It works with the particular 
&gt;&gt; version of glibc that you happen to have installed, yes.  It doesn't work
&gt;&gt; with the version that those people having problems are using, and if you
&gt;&gt; install that version it will stop working for you as well.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;In other words, glibc 2.1 is broken.

StarOffice only works with the old glibc by chance.  There is simply no way 
you can upgrade a library and maintain 100% compatibility in the face of 
all the possible stupid things that a user binary can do - the only way you 
can be sure that two libraries will behave precisely the same is if they 
*are* precisely the same.

However, we are prepared to sacrifice that 100% compatibility and draw a line 
somewhere.  For example, we assume that if a user program has hardwired 
knowledge of the memory address in glibc where a particular variable lives in 
some version, it is making unacceptable demands on the library and we won't 
feel obliged to try to guarantee that it continues working.  Similarly if it 
"knows" what the layout of a FILE structure is and starts directly modifying 
its fields.  The only promises that are made about the interface to newer C 
libraries are the interface definitions set out in the documentation.

Using internal C library symbols (anything beginning with an underscore for 
example) is another way in which a user program can poke at the unpublished
details of the libc.  This is also unacceptable.  To discourage this, as of 
glibc 2.1 these internal symbols are simply not visible to such programs.

StarOffice tries to refer to __libc_init and __setfpucw at least; maybe 
others.  Its installer also looks explicitly for "libpthread-0.7.so".  None of 
these are details that a well behaved program should concern itself with.

A glib answer like "glibc 2.1 is broken" helps nobody.  If you really believe 
that the library is at fault, take the time to investigate the problem and 
suggest a way to fix it.

(This discussion has nothing to do with the kernel.  Please don't cc the 
linux-kernel list if you reply.)

To: linux-gcc@vger.rutgers.edu

	Hi,

	When I create a `shared memory' resource, I can then destroy
	it using the system call shmctl(). When I'm trying to repeat
	the whole process (recreate the shame resource and then detroy
	it), I'm getting the error: shmctl: Identifier removed.

	As I understand, the kernel refuses to recreate a destroyed
	resource. But then, why I'm not getting an error during the
	recreation of the resource and I'm getting it as I try to
	destroy it? Possibly, I am wrong. Can somebody give me a little
	help? Is there a way to recreate a destroyed resource without
	getting any errors?

	My sources are: info and the LPG project.

	If my question is not appropriate for this mailing list, please
	ignore it. Thank you for your time. :-)

	Best regards,
	Elias

Hi,
It's been rumoured that H.J. Lu said:
&gt; 
&gt; I made a patch for egcs 1.1.2:
&gt; 
&gt; ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/egcs/egcs-1.1.2-19990315.diff.gz

I have some (large) patches for i370 (IBM mainframe) support in egcs.
They add support for the ELF binary format; fix a dozen instruction
generation bugs &amp; etc.  For example, the fixed compiler will now compile
most of glibc and all of the linux kernel (correctly, even, it seems),
whereas the unpatched compiler core dumps almost immediately. 

I've got those patches at http://linas.org/linux/i370 but want to 
shuffle a few files around before formally submitting them.  There
is also a new binutils there that fixes the support for misc supervisor-mode
instructions (i.e. privledged instructions that the compiler does not 
generate but one needs to have when writing kernels...).

I've come across a problem which I think is due to an unfortunate
change in egcs.

I downloaded binaries of Netscape 4.51 for glibc and linux-2.x.  The
binary won't run because a symbol __eh_pc can't be found.  It appears
that the binary is probably expecting to find this symbol in
libstd++.so.2.8.  After looking at versions of this library which I
have, I found an old version which actually has this symbol.  This was
strange because I couldn't find the symbol anywhere in the libstd++-2.8
sources.  However, it appears that the symbol used to be in the egcs
sources (the latest version of the egcs sources which I have has notes
that it was removed at some stage).

It seems to be that older versions of egcs caused this symbol to be
placed in the libstd++*.so libraries (it appears that newer versions
are probably doing the same thing with a differently named symbol).
Hence my problem, the Netscape people have linked against a library
which has been generated by an older egcs (or perhaps gcc) but the
corresponding library which I would like to use has been generated
with a more recent egcs.

Has anyone any comments on this?  Is my analysis correct?

I tried to solve the problem by replacing my libstd++.so.2.8 with one
which has the __eh_pc symbol.  The netscape binary now crashes with
a "Bus error" while loading.

How to call gnu readline function from within a ncurses program?
(to keep control over colors, and such). For now I close the curses

elegant solution :(

Lokesh,

I think you might find it problematic opening so many file descriptors.
You should consider the activity of the client, my guess is not all clients
will be active at the same time.  Therefore you could have a pool of say
100 sockets (can be any number) that you share amongst the 5000 or 
20000 clients.  In this case each client has a type of virtual connection
in the sense that the client may not actually have an open socket but it
looks and acts as if it did.

Obviously when either the server or the client needs to send anything you
must re-establish the socket connection.

Alternatively, you might be able to define a protocol that sends packets of
data between the client and server.  In this way, the socket is only open
while the packet is being sent.  This might get around your problem of 
having so many sockets open at once, but the process of opening and
closing so many socket connection might be over whelming.

Hope this helps.
Cheers
Craig.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing a program (somewhat similar to irc server) that would
&gt; simultaneously open ~5000 sockets and talk to all these clients. As far
as
&gt; i know a process can open only about 50-60 sockets (file descriptors). 
&gt; 
&gt; Will i have to open multiple processes with some form of IPC or shared
&gt; memory, or can i configure a kernel to let a process open any amount of
&gt; file descriptors. If yes, where in the kernel code should i change.
&gt; 
&gt; Can a 200MHz pentium take the load of a process with 5000 open file
&gt; descriptors, or will it just crash. Also which of the above 2 approaches
&gt; (single process or multiple process) will result in better utiliziation
&gt; and better stability.
&gt; 
&gt; What if the number of sockets is 20000 instead of 5000? ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx,
&gt; 
&gt; Lokesh.

hi, 

can anybody help with this ...

i have a class holding some statistics ....

class Stat{
	int count1;
	int count2;
}

i have two classes with class Stat embedded ..

class A{
	Stat stats[10];
	
	....
}

class B{
	Stat stats[10];

	....
}

both of these are encpsulated in another class ...

class C{
	A x[n];
	B y[m];

	...
}

and now, for some k, i would like to be able to print the contents
for all j, of

x[k].stats[j, j=0..9].count1 // or count2
y[k].stats[j, j=0..9].count1 // or count2


one solution i came up with was to define template functions ....

template &lt;class T&gt;
printCount1(T&amp; zz, int i){
	for(int j=0;j&lt;i;j++){
		zz.stats[j].count1;
	}
}

template &lt;class T&gt;
printCount2(T&amp; zz, int i){
	for(int j=0;j&lt;i;j++){
		zz.stats[j].count2;
	}
}

obviously if i was a resonable guy, i would stop at this point and say
it was enough. but as you might have guessed, i am not. i want to
further abstract this into something like 

monitor(char *msg, &lt;pointer to template function&gt;){
	// so i can go 
	cout &lt;&lt; msg;
	call template function;
	cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}

i am out of my depth here, and would appreciate any help that can be
provided. thanks in advance.

Where should I be looking for a libg++ 2.7.2.x that builds on Linux?

I just heard about HP's WebJetAdmin release for Linux, and as we have
dozens of HP printers here I'd really like to administer them from my
office.  Unfortunately the install bombs with complaints that turned out
to be about missing libraries.  For some reason my libg++.so insists that
it is version 27.2.1, and the loader and its buddies are determined not to
see any links or outright copies I might make calling it libg++.so.2.7.2.
Of course HP only supplied binaries.  So I need to build a new libg++ with
the right version number.  The stock 2.7.2 kit from FSF doesn't build a
shareable library at all so that didn't help.

You're going to ask what distribution I'm running.  The answer is
Slackware 1.2 (yes, one dot two) but just about everything has been
replaced so you could call it StupidMarkWare 0.1 if you wanted to. :-)

Thanks!

Hi,

gdb 4.17.0.10 seems to work pretty well with threads in glibc 2.1 on
x86 now.

H.J. Lu (hjl@gnu.org)

Hi, Folks,

This is the beta release of gdb 4.17.0.10, which is based on gdb 4.17
plus Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint/FPU, glibc 2 pthread and Linux/PPC
support. You need linux 2.0.35 or above, or 2.1.xx to get the x86 FPU
to work correctly. The Linux/x86 binary works with all recent kernels
and C libraries, and the x86 FPU support is enabled at the run-time,
depending on the kernel version.

Please report any bugs related to gdb 4.17.0.10 to hjl@lucon.org.

Because most of system calls in glibc 2 are written in assembly without
frame pointer, gdb may not be able to debug nor get stack trace system
calls on glibc-based 2 systems. Due to this, "make check" may fail in

FAIL: gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: backtrace through signal handler
FAIL: gdb.base/signals.exp: bt in signals.exp

with glibc 2.

Also, it is normal to see 

FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: continue (timeout)
FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: echo data (timeout)

if there is

XPASS: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: send_gdb end of file

Due to the new cplus-dem.c from egcs 1.1.1, you will get a few

FAIL: gdb.c++/demangle.exp: maint demangle __xxxxxxxxxx

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.9:

1. Fix support for glibc 2.1 pthread. Need the latest glibc 2.1, newer
   than 16:30pm PST of 19990-02-03.
2. Fix deleting the hardware watchpoint on x86.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.8:

1. The new cplus-dem.c from egcs 1999-01-12 with a bug fix.
2. Add support for deleting the hardware watchpoint on x86.
3. Update support for glibc 2.1 pthread.
4. Fix C++ testsuite.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.6:

1. Support for glibc 2.1 pthread. But it doesn't work, probably due
to the CLONE_PTRACE change to pthread in glibc 2.1.
2. Add support for the older Linux C libraries.
3. Add -static support for glibc 2.1.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.5:

1. Support for glibc 2.0 pthread. It doesn't work with glibc 2.1.
2. The Linux/PPC support.
3. The Linux/Sparc support. Untested.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.4:

1. Fix the Intel FPU tag code handling.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.3:

1. Fix testcases for FPU.
2. Fix x86 hardware watchpoint support.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.2:

1. Fake FP registers on older kernels.

Changes from gdb 4.17:

1. Linux/x86 FPU support is added. You can debug floating point numbers
   just like integers.
2. x86 hardware watchpoint is extended to long long, double and long
   double.
3. More information on x86 CPU status register.
4. Fix a bug when reading beyond the memory boundary.

HH&gt; Hi,

HH&gt; the attached tarball demonstrates the failure of deleting static elements in
HH&gt; classes, if the library that contains these class is unloaded with dlclose.

HH&gt; My question is whether this is a glibc (libdl) bug or a bug in generating the
HH&gt; code (egcs).

HH&gt; System is Linux kernel 2.2.0, glibc 2.0.111, gcc version egcs-2.91.58 19981101
HH&gt; (egcs-1.1.1 pre-release).

It also happens with g++2.8.1 and related bug occurs with g++2.7.2

The problem is someone getting clever, in generating code, in 2.8.x.
The instead of putting the a call to the destructor in the .dtors section
atexit is called.  

When dlclose is called the function is removed, and then when atexit
attempts to call the destructor it dies because the code is gone.


HH&gt; Bug showed up in all older versions of kernel, libc and egcs.

HH&gt; If this bug is known could you please point me to a fix.

A simple fix is to give your static file scope, and not function scope.

HH&gt; If this bug is unknown I likely want to know, if it could be fixed in the recent
HH&gt; future.

I don't know about fixing right but I have tracked it ;)

Is the machine description language the same for egcs and gcc?
what about the macros?

I really don't want to bite off more work porting to egcs, the project 
is already way too complex.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; 6) what's the best way to bootstrap an elf loader?  In particular,

OK, I'll try a newer glibc.

Extra credit: anyone care to clue me in on how to implement 64-bit support
in the machine description file of a machine that only has 32-bit int math? 
The current i370.md confuses 64-bit floats which the machine supports, with 
64-bit ints, which the machine does not and thus its a real ugly mess.

In particular, will any patches for gcc be portable to egcs?

WARNING: This release does not support Linux/PPC. Please don't use
it on Linux/PPC.

This should be final release for binutils 2.9.1.0.x based on binutils
2.9.1. I am planning to release to public this weekend. Please test it
as much as you can. Thanks.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.1.0.20 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 2.9.1 plus Linux/ARM support, some x86 assembler
changes, some PPC bug fixes, some alpha bug fixes and an exception
frame optimization bug fix.

Due to the exception frame optimization bug fix, it is highly
recommended that you recompile all your C++ codes. Otherwise,
exception handling may not work right when an exception is thrown.

Since I no longer have machine running libc 5, starting from this
release, there will be no pre-compiled binaries for libc 5.

There was some problem on Linux/alpha. The binaries generated by the
new binituls may not run correctly on Linux/alpha. It turned out it was
a bug in the alpha dynamic linker in glibc 2.0.6. The current glibc 2.1
and glibc 2.0.7 should be ok.

This release should work on linux/x86/alpha. There are some ELF bug
fixes. But I don't know if it fixes all the bugs reported on
linux/sparc, Linux/MIPS and linux/PPC. I'd like to hear reports on them.
I'd like to release it to public soon. Please test it as much as you
can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.1.0.20 to hjl@lucon.org.

1. 2 x86 16bit mode assembler bugs, "ret" and "movb $35,0x4(%di)", are
fixed.

IMPORTANT:
The .plt format that the Alpha was using was not thread safe.  So I 
changed it.  The new format is *not* binary compatible with the old,
thus you must use glibc 2.0.4 to get an ld.so that can understand it.

Note that the new ld.so knows how to deal with the old .plt format, so
old libraries will still work, but they should be relinked eventually
for performance reasons.

The file list:

1. binutils-2.9.1.0.20.tar.gz. Source code.
2. binutils-2.9.1.0.20-2.9.1.0.20.diff.gz. Patch against the previous
   beta source code.
3. binutils-2.9.1.0.20-glibc.x86.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/x86 binaries
   for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above).
4. binutils-2.9.1.0.20-alpha.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/alpha binaries
   for glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above.

The primary ftp sites for the Linux binutils are:

1. ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils
2. ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC
3. ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC

The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.
 
Most of my stuff can also be found at

1. ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc

To install the binary package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do
 
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.20-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
or
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.20-alpha.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
 
to see what is in there.
 
Please do back up before you remove things.

To install for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.5c or above), PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. rm -f /usr/bin/encaps /usr/bin/nm
4. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.20-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
5. ldconfig
 
Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin. You have to use
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/as
 
and
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux
 
if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.
 
To install for alpha, PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.20-alpha.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
4. ldconfig
 
I have changed the target names for Linux/x86 and Linux/x86 (a.out)
to ix86-linux and ix86-linuxaout respectively. The precompiled
binaries are installed under /usr/ix86-linux and /usr/ix86-linuxaout.
You should make appropriate symbolic links if you have a different
name for the Linux/x86 target, like i586-unknown-linux.

The target name for Linux/alpha is alpha-linux. The precompiled alpha
binaries are installed under /usr/alpha-linux. You should make
appropriate symbolic links if you have a different name for the
Linux/alpha target, like alpha-redhat-linux.

If you have an old linux library in the a.out format and you cannot
obtain the newer version in the ELF format for whatever reason, you
can try "objcopy --remove-leading-char" on the a.out library and see
if it can link with your code in ELF.

Thanks.

IMHO this is a bug in gcc.  It should not use atexit to register the dtor
for static local objects.  Instead it should set up an entry in the .dtors
section.  There is no (standard) way to unregister an atexit function, and
implementing it would require to put a hook into libc for use by the
dynamic linker.

I've been working on a port of gcc/binutils/glibc to a new 
architecture, the IBM mainframe 360/370/390 architecture. I've got 
something sort of working and need some advice &amp; pointers. Long list
follows:

1) where are the latest gcc sources? I'm working on gcc-2.8.1
and have a core dump.  Before I hit my head on it too hard, I'd
like to work with the latest.

2) the core dump is in cc1, in cse.c and only occurs when -O2 is
specified. Some instruction that wants to use a condition code
gets scheduled before the condition code is set. This causes a core
dump.  Does this sound like a known bug?

3) How does one go about debugging something like this? The -da
flag was interesting, but I have no simple test case to demonstrate 
the bug.  Any tools I should be aware of?

4) how hard is it to take a gcc machine description file &amp; port it
to egcs?  Should I stick to gcc or is egcs really the future?

5) who owns crt0.o? the kernel? libc ? it seems not to be part of
binutils or gcc.  

6) what's the best way to bootstrap an elf loader?  In particular,
say I wanted to write something that will load and run elf binaries 
(that have been linked to glibc) on MVS.  What's the quickest way to
hack this up?

7) I'm trying to cross-compile glibc-2.0.6 but the cross-compiler
configure setup is a bit broken &amp; requires nasty hacks.  Is
cross-compiling fixed or improved in a later version? 

8) what's the secret to configing the right math libs &amp; etc for glibc?

9) is there a way of compiling glibc with support for long-long crippled
out?  My version of gcc craps  out on long long and I don't feel like
fixing it right now ...

--linas

BTW, old and broken-ish patches to gcc and binutils are at
http://linas.org/linux/i370/ &amp; will have newer patches soon.

Hello everybody,

I'm about to complete my first package which I consider will be useful
for the public.
It is a tool for helping sysadmins syncing password files among small
nets. Yes, I know there is NIS, but this is more easier to setup and
maintain. For now it consists from daemon for changing passwd/shadow
files, client for linux, client for window$, cgi script in perl.
I want to ask where to upload this, is there any interest and if there
is, how to get support for extending capabilities of the software. I'm
also interested who would help me with beta testing when I upload the
package.

Best regards:

Alexander Feldman

Hi,

I'm ready to release glibc 2.1 for now three days but can't do this
because we don't have the crypt add-on in place.  The place where it
was announced to be for the test releases is not stable and capable to
handle large numbers of requests.  We can't upload it to the usual
place since the person who has to do this does not respond.

So, if you have a non-US FTP server large enough to handle a few
thousand downloads of a package with 30kB after every glibc release
please contact me ASAP.

Thanks,

There's good online book at LDP called The Linux Kernel. Also, if you have 
recent 2.2.x kernels look in linux/Documentation/kernel-docs.txt file. There
is also the book Linux Kernel Internals, i do not have it but i've heard good
things.

Hi,
	This message should actually be posted on linux-kernel.
Anyway, I am no longer on that list. There are a lot of web sites you
would like to browse through, like Redhat Kernel Hackers Guide (KHG).
See some issues of Linux Journal, I think issues #23, #24, #25, #26, etc.
They all carry articles from A Rubini on Linux Device Drivers. Also,
get a feel of writing device drivers on other platforms, the DDI/DKI
specs, etc.

regards,
Balbir Singh.

Dear Sir,

&gt;&gt;    printf("i[1000][1000] = %ld\n", i[1000][1000]);
You try to access memory beyon the array's bound, so SIGSEGV is normal
reaction.

Dohh!  Stupid me, wasn't paying attention.  Changed "1000" to "999" and "%ld"
to "%d" and it runs without problems.  So, I have no idea what's going on with
the original poster's system.

After I changed the array bounds to correct values, it ran just fine.  I
suppose I should change the core file size for my mortal user's account, but
it's generally not a problem.

Being spoiled by Java's garbage collector leads me to this quick
question again concerning constructors in C++.

If I allocate memory via "new" using a constructor

i.e.

    class Foo
    {
      Foo()
        { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }

      ~Foo()
        { delete word; }
        
        ...
     }

When I create an object of class Foo memory will be allocated for the
char buffer "word". Now when the object is no longer needed must I
make an explicit call to the destructor ~Foo() to destroy the object
and subsequently call "delete", or, is the destructor somehow called
automatically when the object is no  longer needed,i.e.  outside of
it's scope?

Even in Java there are times when it is up to you to destroy an object
and/or free memory used for that object, depending on how the object
is/was created and an method equivalent of a destructor is required...
The garbage collector is not always adequate.

Thanks...

Sincerely,

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.


Hello Linux &amp; gcc gurus.

If coming Linux distribution are ready to use gcc-2.8.x and 
nothing earlier, then please ignore this post.

Both Linux and gcc are advancing fast. Both projects, that is
Linux-kernel and the gcc's egcs project are very valuable to
the software community.
I haven't been following the technical details, but I understand
that there were (still are?) problems using gcc-2.8.1 (or higher)
compiling the kernel.

The improvements in the C++ part of gcc (g++) are very significant.
Serious C++ programmers who use STL cannot stay with or go back to gcc-2.7.x.
Having active installed variants of gcc in Linux environment
is a hassle in terms of Makefile maintenance for developers,
and environment variables setting for run time shared libraries.

Please let me beg: 
  May the coming major Linux distribution, with kernel &gt;= 2.2
  have the necessary patches for gcc-2.8.x.y so a single installed
  gcc with libgcc could compile and run the kernel and
  perform well with C++ templates in general and specifically with STL.

The binary I found (pkgview) was built on a redhat 5.1 system.

I have a 5.2 system.

This program won't load on my system, I get:
./pkgview: error in loading shared libraries
: undefined symbol: __register_frame_info

In gcc 2.8.1, its in libgcc2...

Any advice?

Hello,

compile this to a little shared lib

__register_frame_info() {}
__unregister_frame_info() {}

with gcc -shared -o /usr/local/lib/libfix.so something.c
And then you will be able to run this binaries with

Hi,
The destructor is automatically called when the
object in question is no longer needed. Such as
an object is created inside a function locally and
when the function returns the object gets killed with
the destructor executed. Hence we dont call the 
destructor explicitly.

And in java I feel the garbage collection concept is
implemented quite strong and rarely do we use explicit
deallocation.

In C++ you must always specifically call the destructor before the
variable goes out of scope.  When it goes out of scope the variable name
and the memory it points to become unlinked and there is no way for you to
go back and free that memory.  That's how you get memory leaks :)

&gt; i.e.
&gt; 
&gt;     class Foo
&gt;     {
&gt;       Foo()
&gt;         { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }
&gt; 
&gt;       ~Foo()
&gt;         { delete word; }
&gt;         
&gt;         ...
&gt;      }
&gt;

I think the above is a bit confusing. THe question was about calling the
destructor and then something about scope.

But talking about scope is confusing, since what you are talking about is
the pointers scope ... not the dynamically allocated object (would that
even make sense ... i.e. can you talk about the scope of a dynamic object
?)

Certainly memory leaks if an only pointer to some object goes out of scope
... but in many cases this doesn't matter since some other pointer will be
passed the address of the object in question.

Anyway, as Suresh pointed out, when a dynamic object is deleted it's
destructor is implicitly called.

To sum up the ways objects are destroyed:

1 When a dynamic object is deleted, the destructor is called IMPLICITLY

2 An automatic object (on the stack AFAIK) or static object will be
destroyed automatically, when it goes out of scope - i.e. at the end of a
block or at program termination, and then the destructor is called
IMPLICITLY.

The example below should serve as illustration. Three objects are created
in different ways. All are destroyed, but none explicitly. Actually, you
only rarely call the destructor EXPLICITLY, but take a look at:
 
http://www.cerfnet.com/~mpcline/C++-FAQs-Lite/

-------------------------
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

class foo 
{ 
	int x;  

public: 
        foo(int _x):x(_x) {}
        ~foo() { cout &lt;&lt; "I am destroyed: " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt;endl; } 
}; 

foo z(1);  

main()  
{
        foo * x = new foo(2); 
        delete x; 
        foo y(3);  
}
 ------- 
I am destroyed: 2 
I am destroyed: 3 
I am destroyed: 1

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Being spoiled by Java's garbage collector leads me to this quick
&gt; question again concerning constructors in C++.
&gt; 
&gt; If I allocate memory via "new" using a constructor
&gt; 
&gt; i.e.
&gt; 
&gt;     class Foo
&gt;     {
&gt;       Foo()
&gt;         { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }
&gt; 
&gt;       ~Foo()
&gt;         { delete word; }
&gt;         
&gt;         ...
&gt;      }
&gt; 
&gt; When I create an object of class Foo memory will be allocated for the
&gt; char buffer "word". Now when the object is no longer needed must I
&gt; make an explicit call to the destructor ~Foo() to destroy the object
&gt; and subsequently call "delete", or, is the destructor somehow called
&gt; automatically when the object is no  longer needed,i.e.  outside of
&gt; it's scope?

If you allocate a 'Foo' off the stack, like:

Foo myFoo;

then it will be automaticly destroyed as soon as the function
in which it was created ends (it will be destroyed automagicly).
Destruction results in the destructor (~Foo()) being called, and the
memory allocated to Foo (in this case off the stack) being released.
In short, you don't have to do anything.

HOWEVER, you need to change your destructor so that it looks like this:

{delete [] word;}

In short: if your call to new uses [], so should your call to delete.
          Notice how you don't need to put a length in the [] durring a
          delete. C++ just need to know it's an array you're deleting.
          It will deal with the length.

&gt; 
&gt; Even in Java there are times when it is up to you to destroy an object
&gt; and/or free memory used for that object, depending on how the object
&gt; is/was created and an method equivalent of a destructor is required...
&gt; The garbage collector is not always adequate.
&gt; 

In C/C++:

 If you created it off the stack, it will handle the cleanup.
 If you created it dynamically, (usually new/malloc()) you
   must clean it up.

Actually the destructor should be
      ~Foo()
        { delete[] word; } // as an array has been allocated.

No.  You must explictly destroy the contained object in the
destructor of the container.  

The following code has a container bar which holds foo.  bar's
constructor new's a copy of foo, but it's destructor does not
explicitly destroy that object.
 
--[ begin code ]---

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

class foo {
public:
    foo( ) { printf("constructor foo( ) called.\n"); }
   ~foo( ) { printf("destructor ~foo( ) called.\n"); }
};

class bar {
 public:
    bar( ) { printf("constructor bar( ) called.\n");
             fp = new foo( ); }

   ~bar( ) { printf("destructor ~bar( ) called.\n"); }

   foo* fp;
};

void main( ) {
   bar *bp;

   bp = new bar();

   delete bp;
}

--[ end code ]---

--[ begin output ]--
constructor bar( ) called.
constructor foo( ) called.
destructor ~bar( ) called.
--[ end output ]--

If the destructor were autmatically called, then you would see
"destructor ~foo( ) called." in the output.  You must explictly
destroy objects you create.  You can get around this by using
the auto_ptr class which will destroy pointers when the auto_ptr
object goes out of scope.

You need to destroy the object when you have allocated it on the heap.
You need to do the reference counting yourself (or use a reference
class that does it automatically). 

class* Foo foop = new Foo;

// blah blah blah

delete foop;

You don't call ~Foo explicitly but you do explicitly destroy the object.

There are two situations.  One is that the value is created on the
stack inside a function call.  Global variables are similar except that
they don't get deleted until main() terminates.  Thus, you can do:


void my_func()
{
  Foo foo;

  /* do some stuff here */

} /* Foo gets deallocated */


Upon reaching the close bracket of the function, foo gets deleted
automatically, and any relevant destructors are called.

This is true of *any* pair of brackets; they don't have to be
a function.  For example:

void my_func(bool do_it)
{
  if (do_it)
  {
    Foo foo;
    /* some stuff */
  } /* foo gets deallocated */

  /* foo is _not_ valid here */
}

This is what is called "scoping".  The scope of foo in the function above
is the interior of the if (do_it) block of code.  In the other example,
the scope is the body of my_func.

Now, if you allocate a Foo on the *heap* (that is, with the 'new' keyword),
you have to keep track of the memory yourself.  You're already doing this
within the Foo class; it has a character array called "word" which it
explicitly allocates space for, and then explictly deallocates when the
object gets destoryed.

In the exact same way, any Foo's created with 'new' need to be explictly
tracked.  For example:


void my_func()
{
  Foo *foo = new Foo;

  /* code */

  delete foo;

} /* Foo is NOT automatically deallocated here */

This can, of course, easily lead to memory "leaks" where space is allocated
but no pointer is kept to the location.

Foo *my_func()
{
  return new Foo;
}

void other_func()
{
  my_func();
}

If other_func() gets called, it's a memory leak.  No one is keeping track
of the allocated Foo object, and it is now in your program's memory space
with no way to address it.

In C++, when an object(variable as you call it) goes out of scope its'
destructor is automatically called. If the call to delete is in the
destructor then the memory will be freed before the object is completely
unlinked.

In C++ you must always specifically call the destructor before the
variable goes out of scope.  When it goes out of scope the variable name
and the memory it points to become unlinked and there is no way for you
to
go back and free that memory.  That's how you get memory leaks :)

&gt; i.e.

&gt;     class Foo

Hi,

 I have a question. For arrays allocated with new I was taught to delete them
like:

delete [] array;

When the following is done, does it merely delete the "pointer" or does it also
delete the array:

delete array;

?

Or, if more appropriate, where can I look for more information?

TIA,
mike

Actually, although I didn'tshow it in the example but I defined the
variable "word" at the beginning of the class as:

                 private:

                     char *word;
As a pointer.
Thus, when the allocated memory is killed can'tit be done as :

               delete word;
Or is it still required that it be done in array format as:
                delete[] word; ???

&gt; &gt;&gt;        { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;      ~Foo()
&gt; &gt;&gt;        { delete word; }
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;        ...
&gt; &gt;&gt;     }
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;When I create an object of class Foo memory will be allocated for the
&gt; &gt;&gt;char buffer "word". Now when the object is no longer needed must I
&gt; &gt;&gt;make an explicit call to the destructor ~Foo() to destroy the object
&gt; &gt;&gt;and subsequently call "delete", or, is the destructor somehow called
&gt; &gt;&gt;automatically when the object is no  longer needed,i.e.  outside of
&gt; &gt;&gt;it's scope?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Even in Java there are times when it is up to you to destroy an object
&gt; &gt;&gt;and/or free memory used for that object, depending on how the object
&gt; &gt;&gt;is/was created and an method equivalent of a destructor is required...
&gt; &gt;&gt;The garbage collector is not always adequate.
&gt; &gt;&gt;

Anything that is allocated with a 
         new classtype[] should be deleted with a delete[].

   A pointer which is allocated with a "new classtype[]" actually points 
to an array in the memory( heap ). Thus  a delete[] is necessory to 
deallocated the allocated mem. A "delete" on the contrary might 
deallocate only one sizeof( classtype ) bytes from the memory.

   We can have a, 

   class Microsoft *BG;
   BG = new Microsoft;
   delete BG; // This is Valid , and its dead !!!

   This is also valid, a *x points to only one block on the heap with 
size = sizeof( A )

Note : when a new[] is done, the amount of mem blocks allocated are 
internally maintained by C++ so that delete[], deallocates the right no 
of blocks.

&gt;&gt; vive,
&gt;&gt; Prasanna subash
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Actually, although I didn'tshow it in the example but I defined the
&gt;variable "word" at the beginning of the class as:
&gt;
&gt;                 private:
&gt;
&gt;                     char *word;
&gt;As a pointer.
&gt;Thus, when the allocated memory is killed can'tit be done as :
&gt;
&gt;               delete word;
&gt;Or is it still required that it be done in array format as:
&gt;                delete[] word; ???
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;/John &lt;micros50@computer.net&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt;&gt; &gt;The destructor is automatically called when the
&gt;&gt; &gt;object in question is no longer needed. Such as
&gt;&gt; &gt;an object is created inside a function locally and
&gt;&gt; &gt;when the function returns the object gets killed with
&gt;&gt; &gt;the destructor executed. Hence we dont call the
&gt;&gt; &gt;destructor explicitly.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;And in java I feel the garbage collection concept is
&gt;&gt; &gt;implemented quite strong and rarely do we use explicit
&gt;&gt; &gt;deallocation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Being spoiled by Java's garbage collector leads me to this quick
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;question again concerning constructors in C++.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If I allocate memory via "new" using a constructor
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;i.e.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    class Foo
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    {
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      Foo()
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      ~Foo()
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        { delete word; }
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;        ...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     }
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When I create an object of class Foo memory will be allocated for 
the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;char buffer "word". Now when the object is no longer needed must I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;make an explicit call to the destructor ~Foo() to destroy the 
object
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and subsequently call "delete", or, is the destructor somehow 
called
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;automatically when the object is no  longer needed,i.e.  outside of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;it's scope?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Even in Java there are times when it is up to you to destroy an 
object
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and/or free memory used for that object, depending on how the 
object
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;is/was created and an method equivalent of a destructor is 
required...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The garbage collector is not always adequate.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

You need to re-read the actual regulations.  

Let's see.  You probably mean the December changes, not the September
ones which only applied to financial institutions (the December
changes were announced in September).  In that case, the clause you're
looking for is CFR 740.17 (a) (3) (ii):

(ii) Eligible commodities and software. (A) Mass market and non-
mass market encryption commodities and non-mass market software having
symmetric algorithms with key lengths up to and including 56-bits, such
as DES or equivalent (such as RC2, RC4, RC5, and CAST) which are
classified as a result of a technical review (see paragraph (c) of this
section). The commodity or software must not allow the alteration of
the cryptographic functionality by the user or any other program.
Encryption chips, integrated circuits, toolkits and executable or
linkable modules are not authorized for export under the provisions of
paragraph (a)(3).


Since the GNU C library is, by definition, a toolkit and/or a linkable
module, and it most certainly allows the user to alter its
functionality, it would not be permitted to be exported under this
licence exemption.

 &gt; I've been working on a port of gcc/binutils/glibc to a new 
 &gt; architecture, the IBM mainframe 360/370/390 architecture. I've got 
 &gt; something sort of working and need some advice &amp; pointers. Long list
 &gt; follows:

 &gt; 1) where are the latest gcc sources? I'm working on gcc-2.8.1
 &gt; and have a core dump.  Before I hit my head on it too hard, I'd
 &gt; like to work with the latest.
Check egcs from http://egcs.cygnus.com
 &gt; 2) the core dump is in cc1, in cse.c and only occurs when -O2 is
 &gt; specified. Some instruction that wants to use a condition code
 &gt; gets scheduled before the condition code is set. This causes a core
 &gt; dump.  Does this sound like a known bug?

 &gt; 3) How does one go about debugging something like this? The -da
 &gt; flag was interesting, but I have no simple test case to demonstrate 
 &gt; the bug.  Any tools I should be aware of?

 &gt; 4) how hard is it to take a gcc machine description file &amp; port it
 &gt; to egcs?  Should I stick to gcc or is egcs really the future?

 &gt; 5) who owns crt0.o? the kernel? libc ? it seems not to be part of
 &gt; binutils or gcc.  

 &gt; 6) what's the best way to bootstrap an elf loader?  In particular,
 &gt; say I wanted to write something that will load and run elf binaries 
 &gt; (that have been linked to glibc) on MVS.  What's the quickest way to
 &gt; hack this up?

 &gt; 7) I'm trying to cross-compile glibc-2.0.6 but the cross-compiler
 &gt; configure setup is a bit broken &amp; requires nasty hacks.  Is
 &gt; cross-compiling fixed or improved in a later version? 
Please explain this in more detail.  The last cross compile I did was
the test release 2.0.95 of glibc 2.1 and it worked.

 &gt; 8) what's the secret to configing the right math libs &amp; etc for glibc?
You want to look through the sysdeps dir and check Implies.
 &gt; 9) is there a way of compiling glibc with support for long-long crippled
 &gt; out?  My version of gcc craps  out on long long and I don't feel like
 &gt; fixing it right now ...
Not that I know of.

&gt; IMHO this is a bug in gcc.  It should not use atexit to register the
&gt; dtor for static local objects.  Instead it should set up an entry in
&gt; the .dtors section.  There is no (standard) way to unregister an
&gt; atexit function, and implementing it would require to put a hook
&gt; into libc for use by the dynamic linker.

I've said it before, I'll say it again, anything less than the right
fix is a waste of time in my humble opinion, and the right fix is I
claim obvious and singular.  We have talked about it before.

If someone wants to implement this, I'd be happy to explain again or

I've got both libc5 and libc6 libraries on my system, my
primary C library is still libc.so.5.
The problem is that the dynamic linker for some programs
(the java bytecode interpreter in JDK 1.1.7) links libc5-based
X libraries, although the programs are libc6-based.

Here is my setup:

/etc/ld.so.conf:

/lib-aout=libc4
/usr/local/lib=libc5
/opt/kde/lib=libc5
/usr/X11R6/lib=libc5
/usr/i486-linuxaout/lib=libc4
/usr/openwin/lib
/opt/Office50/lib=libc6
/opt/jdk117_v1a/lib/i686/green_threads=libc6

(in /opt/Office50/lib I have all necessary libc6 libraries.)
I have attached the output of ldconfig -p (which is OK).

ldd /opt/jdk117_v1a/bin/i686/green_threads/java gives
following output:

        libXThrStub.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libXThrStub.so.6 (0x402a1000)

Here you see the problem: The dynamic linker should link the
libc6-based X libraries in /opt/Office50/lib and not the libc5-based
ones in /usr/X11R6/lib. 
ldd /opt/Office50/bin/soffice.bin (output attached) shows that
the correct libc6-based X libraries are linked for StarOffice!
It does not help to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

I am using version 1.9.9 of ld.so (compiled for libc5).
Any idea what's wrong w/ my setup?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Cheers,
Oliver Mai

Release 2.1 of the GNU C library is now available at

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc

and all the mirror sites around the globe.

The new files are

	glibc-2.1.tar.gz
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.tar.gz
	glibc-crypt-2.1.tar.gz

People outside the US must *not* download the crypt add-on from this
server.  Instead get the file from

	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/gnu/funet


There is no localedata add-on anymore as there was in glibc 2.0.  Don't
use the add-on from glibc 2.0, the necessary data already comes with the
main tar file.

This release of the library runs on the following targets:

	*-*-gnu			GNU Hurd
	i[3456]86-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on Intel
	m68k-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on Motorola 680x0
	alpha-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on DEC Alpha
	powerpc-*-linux-gnu     Linux and MkLinux on PowerPC systems
	sparc-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on SPARC
	sparc64-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on UltraSPARC
	arm-*-none		ARM standalone systems
	arm-*-linux		Linux-2.x on ARM
	arm-*-linuxaout		Linux-2.x on ARM using a.out binaries

Work on ports to mips-*-linux-gnu, sparc-sun-solaris, and mips-sgi-irix6
are under way but need more work.  Help to finish the ports is welcome.


The 2.1 release is the result of two years of work and includes
thousands of changes, improvements, and bug fixes.  It is therefore
advised that all users of glibc 2.0 upgrade to this version.

*BUT*: updating the C library is no trivial task and it is very easy
to damage one's system.  Therefore, persons who do not exactly know
what to do, should consider using a binary distribution instead, when
they become available.  All major Linux distributors will hopefully
base their next release on glibc 2.1.  Don't tell us you haven't been
warned.  Another reason why not everybody should think about compiling
glibc is the disk and CPU requirements: on Intel platforms the full
build requires about 290MB plus the space you need to install it.
This number is probably higher on RISC platforms.  During the
compilation the compiler will need large amounts of virtual memory.
We are talking about 100MB on Intel and 200MB on Alpha.  If using the
`-j' option of make this numbers grow linearly.  Compiling takes more
than 4 hours on a i586@133, and still 45 minutes on a 2xi686@233.  See
the FAQ file for more numbers.

In case you decide to compile glibc yourself you need to read the file
INSTALL.  It will explain among other things which tools are
necessary.  The most important one is the compiler.  Although other
versions might work it is recommended to get egcs 1.1.1 to compile
glibc since it is the only version of gcc which proved to work for all
the supported platforms.  In case of a problem during the compilation
with a compiler other than egcs 1.1.1 get the recommended version
first (at http://egcs.cygnus.com).  This is especially true for gcc
2.7.2.3 which (some people believe) is a usable compiler.  But in fact
it is extremely buggy and will definitely fail to compile glibc on
every platform.


The 2.1 release should be binary compatible with the 2.0 release.  All
programs should continue to run.  There are only a few exceptions:

- some shared libraries have to be updated as well.  They are using
  details from the libc.  These libraries include the C++ library
  (libstdc++) and the curses library.  See the FAQ for more information.
  Programs using these libraries are not effected.

- some programs use *internal* symbols of the C library.  These names of
  these symbols all start with an underscore and the reason why these
  symbols are "internal" is because they change or might fall away in
  new versions of the library.  And this did happen a lot.  Don't even
  think about complaining on the libc lists about this, the programmers
  of these applications made the errors.  We have now mechanisms in
  place which will prevent this from happening again even in the presence
  of programmers unwilling to follow the rules.

For people using old pre-2.0 snapshots (this particularly affects
PowerPC users, for a while the standard glibc on powerpc was a 961212
snapshot), note that all 2.x versions are binary incompatible with
pre-2.0 snapshots.  In general, binary compatibility is not guaranteed
if you use unreleased versions of glibc.


Problems should all be reported using the `glibcbug' shell script.  Simply
run this script, fill out the information and you are set.  If at the time
you start the script it complains like this

	/usr/bin/glibcbug: emacs: command not found

simply set one of the environment variables EDITOR and VISUAL (this should
happen on every system automatically):

	env EDITOR=vi glibcbug

Before sending a bug report make sure you have read the BUGS and the
FAQ file which come with the glibc sources.  You won't even get an
answer if it is obvious you haven't read these files.  It is also
helpful to scan the appropriate newsgroups and mailing lists to see
whether somebody else already had this problem.  There is another
thing we don't want to hear about: the size.  glibc is big, but this
is necessary for a multi-platform Unix library.


Over the last two years many people helped by contributing code,
reporting bugs, sending patches.  I cannot mention them all here but
sure want to mention those who continuously helped all the time.  In
purely random order:

	Andreas Jaeger
	Andreas Schwab
	H.J. Lu
	Philip Blundell
	Richard Henderson
	Geoff Keating
	Zack Weinberg
	Roland McGrath
	Mark Kettenis
	Thorsten Kukuk
	Christian Gafton

The list with the changes below contains a few more names.  Please
remember those names for the day you have the opportunity to thank
them.


Finally, the (certainly incomplete) list of changes:

* Richard Henderson corrected size of struct timeval on Linux/Alpha to
  conform to POSIX member type requirements.  Symbol versions have been
  adjusted as needed within the library, and for direct use by applications,
  but there is potential for problems if third-party libraries use
  struct timeval as part of their interface.  This does not present
  a problem for X and other "essential" system libraries.

* An additional locale model to support C++ Standard Library locale
  model and probably more was implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

* Eric Youngdale and Ulrich Drepper implemented versioning of objects on
  symbol level.

* Miles Bader provided the `argp' function family to support hierachical
  command line argument parsing, layered on top of getopt.

* strtod accepts new hexadecimal floating-point format from ISO C 9X.

* printf has two new specifiers %a and %A to print hexadecimal flaoting-point
  numbers.

* scanf recognizes the %a and %A format for scanning floating point numbers.

* the new headers &lt;stdint.h&gt; and &lt;inttypes.h&gt; from ISO C 9X provides
  information and interfaces for the available integer types.

* about 130 new math functions were added to implement the ISO C9x math
  library.

* the new header &lt;complex.h&gt; contains definitions of the complex math
  functions from ISO C 9X.

* the new header &lt;tgmath.h&gt; defines generic macros to use complex or
  real valued functions.

* Thorsten Kukuk provided an implementation for NIS+, securelevel 0, 1 and 2.

* Andreas Jaeger provided a test suite for the math library.

* Mark Kettenis implemented the utmpx interface and an utmp daemon.

* Ulrich Drepper added character set conversion functions (iconv).

* Optimized string functions have been added.

* The localedata addon is now part of glibc.

* An implementation of profiling shared libraries was added by Ulrich Drepper.

* Thorsten Kukuk and Ulrich Drepper provided an implementation for a caching
  daemon for NSS (nscd).

  Missing a better place here are some numbers on improvements.  Under
  Linux 2.1.125 un-tar-ing the kernel sources takes

				  user	system	   wall

    using local files		12.19s	 6.88s	 22.91s

    using NIS			13.92s	 8.91s	 26.34s

    using NIS &amp; nscd		10.37s	 7.34s	 25.30s

    using NIS+			27.57s	30.37s  640.46s

    using NIS+ &amp; nscd           10.25s   7.83s   26.51s

    using NIS &amp; old nscd [1]	13.83s	 8.32s	 29.60s

  Keep in mind that non-namelookup related operations dominate above times.
  It was just a common complain that using NIS+ unpacking the kernel is
  horribly slow.

  [1] The old nscd implementation is not available anymore since it was
  distributed with glibc up to version 2.0.98 and thus is now replaced.

* Tim Waugh provided an implementation of the POSIX.2 wordexp function family.

* Mark Kettenis provided a Hesiod NSS module.

* The ELF dynamic loader knows how to process dynamic string tokens ($ORIGIN
  and $PLATFORM) in RPATHs and similar strings (Ulrich Drepper).

* rcmd can now handle netgroups (Dick Streefland).

* A port to the ARM was contributed by Phil Blundell, Pat Beirne and Scott
  Bambrough.

* Support for the IPv6 protocol has been added to the socket API, as per the
  latest draft standards.

* Support for Linux 2.2 has been added.

OK,
thanks everyone; I got onto egcs it was a lot easier than I imagined.
I got extendsidi to work.  Now for the next stumper:

How can I get functions that return scalars that are SImode or smaller 
to return in a register, but functions returning DImode to do so in
memory?  

I've got this little problem: by convention/history/backwards
comaptibility, the value returned by a subroutine went into
R15 (and there are only 16 registers, all SI in size.) So clearly
a DImode returned value won't fit.  I can't just shuffle things around,
r14 is used for linkage, r13 for stack, r12 for toc, r11 for args. 
So it would be nasty to move these.

I've tried fiddling with the FUNCTION_VALUE macro to turn it into a 
pointer to memory, but that leads to various core dumps.  I've tried
putting stronger restrictions on registers, but that never changes
anything.

Maybe I should try writing an instruction pattern that "demotes"
a set:DImode  regsiter into an SImode pointer to memory?

&gt; It is a tool for helping sysadmins syncing password files among small
&gt; nets. Yes, I know there is NIS, but this is more easier to setup and
&gt; maintain. For now it consists from daemon for changing passwd/shadow
&gt; files, client for linux, client for window$, cgi script in perl.

Cool.  There is actually a commercial one (can't remember the name right off
hand) that was reviewed in Linux Journal this month which is similar.
But of course we always prefer free/open source software in these parts...

&gt; I want to ask where to upload this,

You need to make a homepage for it.  Go to www.linuxapps.com and look up any
small software package; most of them will have a homepage with a brief
description of the software, information on how to get it (or best yet,
a link straight to the file), and a screenshot if it's a GUI-based app.

If you don't have your own web space, there are several of sites which are
devoted to giving space to open source projects.  I don't know any right
off hand, but I've seen them listed on slashdot.org in the past.  Maybe
start with opensource.org and see if they've got some links...

&gt; is there any interest and if there
&gt; is, how to get support for extending capabilities of the software. I'm
&gt; also interested who would help me with beta testing when I upload the
&gt; package.

You just need to get people using it.  Once that happens, it's inevitible
that you'll get a) bug reports and b) people who want to extend its
capabilities.

In order to get people using it, you first need the above-mentioned website.
Then you need to get it linked someplace with visibility.  The first two
I'd go for would be linuxapps.com and freshmeat.net.  Once you've got a
blurb about it archived in those two spots, other links should show up over
time.

Linuxbox. They're commercial but they offer free services for logiciel
libre (a.k.a. free software a.k.a. open source software) The exact URL
is (I think) http://rocko.linuxbox.com/.

    Geoff&gt; You need to re-read the actual regulations.

Hm, looks like, apparently.

    Geoff&gt; clause you're looking for is CFR 740.17 (a) (3) (ii):

That's right, I thought I was referring to that.

    Geoff&gt; paragraph (c) of this section). The commodity or software must not
    Geoff&gt; allow the alteration of the cryptographic functionality by the
    Geoff&gt; user or any other program.  Encryption chips, integrated circuits,
    Geoff&gt; toolkits and executable or linkable modules are not authorized for
    Geoff&gt; export under the provisions of paragraph (a)(3).

I only read "Encryption chips" and ICs; "Toolkits and [...] modules" escaped
my attention. Anyone who wonders how that can happen is encouraged to read
the whole Register entry in all of it's beauty :-)

    Geoff&gt; Since the GNU C library is, by definition, a toolkit and/or a
    Geoff&gt; linkable module, and it most certainly allows the user to alter
    Geoff&gt; its functionality, it would not be permitted to be exported under
    Geoff&gt; this licence exemption.

Obviously, yes. -- Sigh -- Sometimes I wonder how many working hours
world-wide are wasted by this silly regulation. Hopefully the Wassenaar
treaty will ease our work; it promises to free "software in the public
domain", which in their terms includes BSD and GPL copyrights. Let's wait
and see.

Thanks for the correction.

Which I corrected and fixed the SIGSEGV; also fixed the "%ld" to "%d".  I still

That's because you've never used delete to delete a new[]ed array of objects
which deallocate memory in their destructor.

delete[] calls the destructor for each element of an array of objects.
delete calls the destructor only once for the object pointed to.

Hi,

Here is gdb 4.17.0.11. Enjoy.

H.J. Lu (hjl@gnu.org)

Hi, Folks,

This is the beta release of gdb 4.17.0.11, which is based on gdb 4.17
plus Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint/FPU, glibc 2 pthread and Linux/PPC
support. You need linux 2.0.35 or above, or 2.1.xx to get the x86 FPU
to work correctly. The Linux/x86 binary works with all recent kernels
and C libraries, and the x86 FPU support is enabled at the run-time,
depending on the kernel version.

To debug LinuxThreads in glibc 2.1, you need to apply the patch,
glibc-2.1-linuxthreads-gdb.diff.gz.

Please report any bugs related to gdb 4.17.0.11 to hjl@lucon.org.

Problems:

Because most of system calls in glibc 2 are written in assembly without
frame pointer, gdb may not be able to debug nor get stack trace system
calls on glibc-based 2 systems. Due to this, "make check" may fail in

FAIL: gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: backtrace through signal handler
FAIL: gdb.base/signals.exp: bt in signals.exp

with glibc 2.

Also, it is normal to see 

FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: continue (timeout)
FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: echo data (timeout)

if there is

XPASS: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: send_gdb end of file

Due to the new cplus-dem.c from egcs 1.1.1, you will get a few

FAIL: gdb.c++/demangle.exp: maint demangle __xxxxxxxxxx

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.10:

1. Support LinuxThreads in glibc 2.1 in binaries compiled under glibc
   2.0 and libc 5.
2. Support LinuxThreads on alpha.
3. Support Solaris 2.7/x86.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.9:

1. Fix support for glibc 2.1 pthread. Need the latest glibc 2.1, newer
   than 16:30pm PST of 19990-02-03.
2. Fix deleting the hardware watchpoint on x86.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.8:

1. The new cplus-dem.c from egcs 1999-01-12 with a bug fix.
2. Add support for deleting the hardware watchpoint on x86.
3. Update support for glibc 2.1 pthread.
4. Fix C++ testsuite.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.6:

1. Support for glibc 2.1 pthread. But it doesn't work, probably due
to the CLONE_PTRACE change to pthread in glibc 2.1.
2. Add support for the older Linux C libraries.
3. Add -static support for glibc 2.1.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.5:

1. Support for glibc 2.0 pthread. It doesn't work with glibc 2.1.
2. The Linux/PPC support.
3. The Linux/Sparc support. Untested.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.4:

1. Fix the Intel FPU tag code handling.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.3:

1. Fix testcases for FPU.
2. Fix x86 hardware watchpoint support.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.2:

1. Fake FP registers on older kernels.

Changes from gdb 4.17:

1. Linux/x86 FPU support is added. You can debug floating point numbers
   just like integers.
2. x86 hardware watchpoint is extended to long long, double and long
   double.
3. More information on x86 CPU status register.
4. Fix a bug when reading beyond the memory boundary.

The file list:

1. gdb-4.17-4.17.0.11.diff.gz. Patch against gdb 4.17.
2. gdb-4.17.0.10-4.17.0.11.diff.gz. Patch against gdb 4.17.0.10.
3. gdb-4.17.0.11.x86.gz. Precompiled Linux/x86 statically linked binary.
4. gdb-4.17.0.11.spec. A RPM spec file for RedHat 5.2.
5. glibc-2.1-linuxthreads-gdb.diff.gz. A patch for glibc 2.1.

&gt; If coming Linux distribution are ready to use gcc-2.8.x and nothing
&gt; earlier, then please ignore this post.

To the best of my knowledge, most up to date distributions (Debian, Red Hat,
Slackware, and presumably SuSE too) follow a dual track compiler-wise:
- For C: FSF gcc 2.7.2.x as it's the only version with which Linux 2.0.x 
  can be compiled safely.
- For C++, Fortran etc.: EGCS.

&gt; I haven't been following the technical details, but I understand that
&gt; there were (still are?) problems using gcc-2.8.1 (or higher) compiling the
&gt; kernel.

These problems affect Linux 2.0.x kernels only (Florian La Roche has
collected patches for the known problems at
http://www.suse.de/~florian/kernel+egcs.html).

Linux 2.2.x (the latest stable kernel series) has no problems with gcc 2.8.1
or EGCS.

&gt; The improvements in the C++ part of gcc (g++) are very significant.
&gt; Serious C++ programmers who use STL cannot stay with or go back to
&gt; gcc-2.7.x.

This is part of the reason Debian decided last year to go with EGCS as the
C++ compiler.

&gt; Please let me beg: 
&gt;   May the coming major Linux distribution, with kernel &gt;= 2.2 have the
&gt;   necessary patches for gcc-2.8.x.y so a single installed gcc with libgcc
&gt;   could compile and run the kernel and perform well with C++ templates in
&gt;   general and specifically with STL.

The current Debian version (2.0, "hamm") ships with EGCS 1.0.3a for C++ and
Fortran.

Debian 2.1 ("slink"), which is planned for release next month, will ship
with EGCS 1.1.1 for C++, Fortran and Pascal compilation, and FSF gcc 2.7.2.3
for C compilation, as the default kernel shipped with Debian 2.1 kernel will
still be a 2.0.x one. (Debian 2.1 will be largely 2.2.x ready; see
http://www.debian.org/~rcw/2.2/warnings.html for details).

I expect Debian 2.2 ("potato") will ship with a 2.2.x kernel by default. We
will consider switching to EGCS as the default C compiler by then.

Debian at the moment has no FSF gcc 2.8.1 packages. 

We see very few signs of active development of FSF gcc, and numerous reports
of bugs that are fixed in EGCS. 

In our experience EGCS is quite actively maintained, produces reliable
well-integrated releases and has vast improvements in C++ support over FSF
gcc. Debian itself is a bazaar-style project, and many within Debian (myself
included) believe that bazaar-style development as practiced with EGCS is
the way to go for the development of the GNU compiler.

I hope the FSF will reconsider its position wrt EGCS and bless it as the
standard gcc.

&gt; }

&gt; It seems as though there might be a conflict here.  Is the preceding
&gt; simple program false?

Hi, Dan.  Usually it's best to use the kernel's headers (&lt;scsi/...&gt;,
&lt;net/...&gt;, &lt;linux/...&gt; and &lt;asm/...&gt;) only within the kernel or modules,
and the libc's headers only for applications.  If you need something
that's not in the libc headers (and of course this simple program does
not), then one approach is to borrow just that section and put it in your
own header file (#include "my_nfs_stuff.h"), with a check that __linux__
is defined if you're using a Linux-specific feature.  If it's something
that's only available in certain versions of Linux, you might check the
UTS_RELEASE or LINUX_VERSION_CODE in &lt;linux/version.h&gt;, making the
assumptions that the program will be run on the same system where it's
being compiled and that the headers in place reflect the kernel that's
being run.  You might also offer it to the libc folks if you think it'll
be used much.

You might have a look at ddstar and autofs as examples.

I have installed the RedHat5.2 and Bind. But the DNS server seems not
work properly.
My setting list below:

I hope to set name server and web server on one machine. I run "&gt;ndc

can't find any ip address on there. Should I have to connect the linux
server to internet or network to do this check? Does anyone can give any

Hi,

I made 2.9.1.0.21 without merging with the gas snapshot due to the
ARM/ELF issue. I will see what I can do for 2.9.1.0.22. I want to
support Alpha EV6. But the patch I got from Richard is for the gas
snapshot. I am also looking at a IBM 370 patch. I may or may not go
with the the gas snapshot, depending on ARM/ELF and other things.

Thanks.

WARNING: This release does not support Linux/PPC. Please don't use
it on Linux/PPC.

This should be final release for binutils 2.9.1.0.x based on binutils
2.9.1. I am planning to release to public this weekend. Please test it
as much as you can. Thanks.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.1.0.21 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 2.9.1 plus Linux/ARM support, some x86 assembler
changes, some PPC bug fixes, some alpha bug fixes and an exception
frame optimization bug fix.

Due to the exception frame optimization bug fix, it is highly
recommended that you recompile all your C++ codes. Otherwise,
exception handling may not work right when an exception is thrown.

Since I no longer have machine running libc 5, starting from this
release, there will be no pre-compiled binaries for libc 5.

There was some problem on Linux/alpha. The binaries generated by the
new binituls may not run correctly on Linux/alpha. It turned out it was
a bug in the alpha dynamic linker in glibc 2.0.6. The current glibc 2.1
and glibc 2.0.7 should be ok.

This release should work on linux/x86/alpha. There are some ELF bug
fixes. But I don't know if it fixes all the bugs reported on
linux/sparc, Linux/MIPS and linux/PPC. I'd like to hear reports on them.
I'd like to release it to public soon. Please test it as much as you
can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.1.0.21 to hjl@lucon.org.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.21:

1. Ada demangle support.
2. Don't merge weak undefined symols with definitions from a shared 
object when building shared object. Only for ELF.
3. Fix a 16bit x86 gas bug.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.20:

1. Enable ld for Solaris/x86.
2. Fix an ELF/i386 bfd/linker bug.

   snapshot.
2. Added AMD 3DNow! support to disassembler.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.13:

2. Added AMD 3DNow! support.
3. Add some vxworks suppport.
4. Fix ld on none-linux platforms.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.12:

1. An ELF/alpha bug fix for creating large shared libraries.
2. An ELF/PPC bug fix.

1. Use the real fix from Ian for the exception frame optimization bug.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.10:

1. Fix an exception frame optimization bug.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.9:

1. Fix another -Bsymbolic bug for Linux/alpha.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.7:

1. Fix -Bsymbolic for Linux/alpha.
2. Fix a 16bit x86 gas bug.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.6:

1. Fix various ARM bugs.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.5:

1. A MIPS assembler ".align" bug is fixed.
2. bfd.h, bfd.h and bfdlink.h are included in the binary package.

Changes from binutils 2.9.1.0.4:

1. 2 x86 16bit mode assembler bugs, "ret" and "movb $35,0x4(%di)", are
fixed.

IMPORTANT:
The .plt format that the Alpha was using was not thread safe.  So I 
changed it.  The new format is *not* binary compatible with the old,
thus you must use glibc 2.0.4 to get an ld.so that can understand it.

Note that the new ld.so knows how to deal with the old .plt format, so
old libraries will still work, but they should be relinked eventually
for performance reasons.

The file list:

1. binutils-2.9.1.0.21.tar.gz. Source code.
2. binutils-2.9.1.0.20-2.9.1.0.21.diff.gz. Patch against the previous
   beta source code.
3. binutils-2.9.1.0.21-glibc.x86.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/x86 binaries
   for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above).
4. binutils-2.9.1.0.21-alpha.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/alpha binaries
   for glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above.

The primary ftp sites for the Linux binutils are:

1. ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils
2. ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc
3. ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC
4. ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC

The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.
 
To install the binary package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do
 
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.21-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
or
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.21-alpha.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
 
to see what is in there.
 
Please do back up before you remove things.

To install for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.5c or above), PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. rm -f /usr/bin/encaps /usr/bin/nm
4. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.21-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
5. ldconfig
 
Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin. You have to use
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/as
 
and
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux
 
if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.
 
To install for alpha, PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.21-alpha.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
4. ldconfig
 
I have changed the target names for Linux/x86 and Linux/x86 (a.out)
to ix86-linux and ix86-linuxaout respectively. The precompiled
binaries are installed under /usr/ix86-linux and /usr/ix86-linuxaout.
You should make appropriate symbolic links if you have a different
name for the Linux/x86 target, like i586-unknown-linux.

The target name for Linux/alpha is alpha-linux. The precompiled alpha
binaries are installed under /usr/alpha-linux. You should make
appropriate symbolic links if you have a different name for the
Linux/alpha target, like alpha-redhat-linux.

If you have an old linux library in the a.out format and you cannot
obtain the newer version in the ELF format for whatever reason, you
can try "objcopy --remove-leading-char" on the a.out library and see
if it can link with your code in ELF.

Thanks.

Hi Lei,
	You could try Linux Journal Issuse 23, 24, 25, 26 and some more.
	There is a book by Alessandro Rubini on Linux Device Drivers.
	You can also go through LDP (Linux Documentation Project) and KHG
	(Kernel Hackers Guide) at Redhat web-site.
	Theres a wealth of information out there.

Hi,

Not all ftp sites have been updated yet. It may take a while. The alpha
binary is not there yet. I will upload the alpha binary this weekend.
The main thing in binutils 2.9.1.0.22b is the Pentium III support.
Please check it out and report any bugs back to me.

Thanks.

i486 (myself).

 &gt; So, I really need somebody who has the problems to grab the debugger

But I've noticed that all use Linux 2.2.0pre7 (myself included) that
get these failures.

I disabled the use of the vfork syscall in
sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/vfork.c (changing #ifdef __NR_vfork to #if 0)
and make stdio-common/tests and make timezone/tests was both sucessful
(that's the tests that failed before).  I fear that vfork (either the
glibc wrapper or the Linux implementation) is broken :-(.


Andreas

P.S.: I'm testing glibc 2.1.110 with egcs 1.1.1, binutils 2.9.1.0.19,
Linux 2.2.0pre7 on i486.

P.S.2: Here's the trivial patch for vfork which gets things working
for me.  This isn't a final solution, it's just a workaround.

Implementing the vfork syscall wrapper in the libc apparently provides
some problems.  To find a solution it's necessary to get a
specification of vfork, or at least make one up for Linux.

The problem is this: the vfork'ed process using the same VM as the
initial process.  Assume the following code for now:

      void
      bar ()
      {
	if ((pid = vfork ()) == 0)
	  foo (0);
	else if (pid == -1)
	  ...error...

When calling the vfork wrapper we have the following stack layout:

	...something...
	return address bar after vfork call

Now the child returns from the vfork call and calls `foo' with the
resulting layout:

	...something...
	0
	return address bar after foo call

May `foo' then exit and so the parent process starts and it sees the
return address 0 (zero) which was pushed as a parameter for `foo'.

This certainly is a situation we have to deal with and make sure that
the return address from the `vfork' syscall stays valid.  But this is
only have of the story.  It gets complicated if the use of the vfork
is not restricted.  Assume this:

	void
	bar ()
	{
	  pid_t p = baz ();
	  if (p == 0)
	    foo (0);
	}
	pid_t
	baz ()
	{
	  return vfork ();
	}

Now the stack layout when reachine the syscall wrapper is

	...something...
	return address bar after baz call
	return address baz after vfork call

At the time the function foo is called the stack layout is

	...something...
	0
	return address bar after foo call

I.e., we are again f*cked.  This can of course be repeated for
arbitrary depths of function calls.


So the question is: does the vfork interface on other platforms
restricts the use of vfork to situations like the first example and
disallows the second one (or even deeper nestings)?  I think this is
what the Solaris man page says.

Hi,

The next and hopefully one of the very last test releases for glibc
2.1 is available at

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
and
	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu

The files are

	glibc-2.0.110.tar.gz
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.110.tar.gz

And diff is also available as

	glibc-2.0.109-2.0.110.diff.gz

You also should get the very latest crypt add-on at

	http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pgp/

The diff is large because of many documentation changes.

I know of only one problem which has to be addressed: the distributed
manual will have problems on Hurd systems due to explicit references
to the add-ons.

Give it a try and send feedback, also if it works.

The appended program, when run on a stock Red Hat 5.2 system, produces
incorrect output after allocating approximately 6 megs of stack space.
Output appears after the program.  (Don't forget "-lpthread" if you
compile it yourself.)

The problem is that the LinuxThreads library sets its internal notion
of STACK_SIZE to a constant 2M.  It subtracts twice STACK_SIZE from
the initial value of the stack pointer and rounds down to a multiple
of STACK_SIZE to figure out a nominal "bottom-of-stack" value
for the initial thread.

It uses this bottom-of-stack value for two things.

First, it uses it to figure out which thread is calling into the
library (e.g., for thread_self() and for thread specific data); this
is the problem illustrated by the test case below.  Once esp goes
below the bottom-of-stack value, the library no longer knows that the
calling thread is the initial thread.  (A stock Red Hat system has a
stack size rlimit of 8M.)

Second, it uses the initial thread bottom-of-stack as the top of an
array of contiguously allocated STACK_SIZE chunks, which serve as the
stacks for additional threads.  That is, the second, third,
etc. threads will have stacks which are contiguously allocated below
the nominal bottom-of-stack of the initial thread.  If the stack size
rlimit is greater than 2M, this means each thread will have a stack
overlapping that of some other thread.

This is a Bad Thing.  Not only does it limit each thread's stack usage
to a compiled-in constant of 2M (a value neither detectable nor
settable through getrlimit/setrlimit), it also prevents the kernel
from generating a signal on stack overflow for most threads.  And
while that may be fine for C, it creates a royal pain for people (like
us) who are trying to implement a safe language on top of
LinuxThreads.

I think two things need to happen to fix these problems.

First, STACK_SIZE in LinuxThreads needs to default to a value greater
than the kernel-determined hard rlimit (under Linux, I believe this is
8M).  I realize this will reduce the number of threads you can create,
so perhaps STACK_SIZE should be settable at run-time as part of an
advanced LinuxThreads-specific interface.  Either way, having some
lower value hard-wired in is truly irritating.

Second, LinuxThreads should leave some amount of unallocated,
inaccessible memory between the stacks of the various threads.
Whether that is 4K or 8M, I don't care; it just needs to be an
advertised value so that we can write proper stack probes when
allocating stack space.  (Yes, in JIT-compiled code we could just test
the esp every time, but some of our code is written in C, and all we
can do there is place bounds on the local variable space used.)
Without these sentinels, it is a real pain to guarantee that a user
cannot violate the safety of the language.

Thanks for your time.

glibc 2.0.6 is the last officially released version, glibc 2.0.110 is

We have a system, which uses dlopen() to load some libraries.

On Solaris and SCO system V we create a library with a line like:

	cc -fpic a.o b.o -ly -o libx.so

then when we load libx with dlopen() it also loads liby.so. 
On Linux we have been unable to get this to work. There are 
possible workarounds, but we would like to stick with the 
same solution that we already use on our other systems. 

Does anyone if this can be made to work on Linux?

The next test release is out.  The last things I wanted to change did
change and the reported problems should all be corrected.  I hopefully
haven't introduced new problems and if this is the case glibc 2.1.0
will be out within days.

You can download the files

	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu

and the kernel.org network

	ftp://ftp.CC.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

where CC is the country code for the server most convenient.

Please report any problems and also success reports to

You should declare the operator

ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;,CObject const&amp;);

and implement this operator to append the required format to the given
ostream object. You may need to declare this operator as a friend of
CObject class if you use protected or private members of CObject.

Hello,
I am studying compiling principle of C programming, but I have no idea where I can \
start with. For example, how can it parse the text input by a user? To make the \
problem clearer, I will take an example. Say you have an expression, like "(a&lt;1.5) OR \
(b='abc') AND (2 of (c&gt;0, NOT(d&gt;1), (e='cde') AND (f+g*h/i&lt;1))......". (the \
expression: 2 of (c&gt;0, NOT(d&gt;1), (e='cde') AND (f+g*h/i&lt;1) means when 2 expressions \
in the brackets are true, the expression is true). When input by user, those a, b, \
c,d will be replaced by real value, like "(1&lt;1.5) OR ('cde'='abc') AND (2 of (1&gt;0, \
NOT(5&gt;1), ('cde'='cde') AND (4+8*2/3&lt;1))". You must compute the result of the \
expression. Do you know what I mean? What I want to know is whether you could kindly \
give me some enlightenment. I really do not know what technique to use to parse the \
expression, and how to use some data structure to compute the result, (using a linked \
list, or something else, and also paying attention to the priority of the operator.) \
Any real implementation or information resource will be appreciated.

After a vector insert operation, all iterators (pointers) which are pointing
to vector elements are invalid. This is how STL vector semantics are defined.
It is not a replacement for arrays. But of course, if you store references to
objects in a vector and keep the pointers to objects instead of pointers into
a vector, you will not loose anything.

The %s format in strptime doesn't work.  The problem is that the number
of seconds is not initialized to zero before conversion.

The info description of strptime is somewhat misleading.  It should state

Dear all,
    I think vector of STL in g++ can not substitute traditional array,
because the address of array elements is fixed, but in 'vector' it is 
not true. Because vector is dynamically extended, it is no use for you to 
save the address of some elements.

  I think I was unclear. This was what I said. You cannot keep references to the
elements of a vector if you are inserting elements. What I said was, instead of
storing objects in the vector, you can store references to objects, and instead of
storing a reference to an element of the vector, you can store a reference to the
actual object, i.e.

vector&lt;someclass&amp;&gt;  v;

and instead of storing vector&lt;someclass&amp;&gt;::iterator reference to an element of the
vector, use a someclass&amp; reference to the actual object. After an insert
operation, vector&lt;someclass&amp;&gt;::iterator will be definitely destroyed.

Hope this helps, though it may not.

No, you cannot do that. But then, you shouldn't, either. There is
always a way to achieve the same thing without remembering addresses.

&gt; vector is a type of container, it is used to contain my objects, if I 
&gt; only use vector to store "reference to object", why do I use a 'vector'?

You could still use it to get indexed access, sorting, and iterating.
I typically use vectors of pointers if I know my objects must not
move (sometimes, copying an object will defeat its semantics).

Coming back to your original question: vectors can be used to
substitute arrays. If you modify the array (i.e. re-allocate it), all
pointers into the old array will be gone. Same with vectors.

If you do not modify the vector in a certain number of ways (extending
it, etc.), the references to entries will remain valid, just as they
do in arrays.

Martin

maybe to keep pointers to objects you put into a vector...
maybe to implement a polymorphic vector...
maybe you don't want your objects to be destroyed when the container is destroyed...

If you want to maintain the pointer, I'd suggust you to store
pointers in vector.  One problem for this technique is you'll
have to call operator delete explicitly when you remove elements
from vector.  Using smart pointers (See Effective C++/More Effective C++
by Scott Meyers) solve the above problem.

Think of vector as a smart version of array that
can perform expand, insert, erase for you without having to write
everything yourself.

&gt; Can you tell me how I store my objects, vector or set or individual 
&gt; objects? If I have 10000 objects. Perhaps set is a good way, but it is 
&gt; much different from array.

Depends on how you need to find the objects, and on how dynamic the
set is. If you just create them, and they know how to go away
themselves, and are found at the appropriate times, then individual
objects is the best approach.

If you create all 10000 at one time, and then they live until the end
of the application, and you need to iterate through them, put their
pointers into a vector.

If you have sometimes 5000, sometimes 10000, and you are more
frequently creating than actually using the objects, sets might be
more performant.

&gt; It is different. When I re-allocate my array, I know the address is 
&gt; invalid, I can do something to keep the correct addresses. But in vector,
&gt; when I push_back an element to vector, I do not know the addresses I keeped 
&gt; is valid or not.

I would need to re-read the standard, but I think these things are
specified, and it probably says that you cannot assume that the
addresses remain valid.

&gt; If I can not extend it, I will use array, what is the goodness of 
&gt; vector?

In this particular application, nothing. However, there are good
applications for vectors. They don't involve keeping references to
fields, though.

Martin

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
and
	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu
and
	ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

	(XX = your country code; us, de, jp or whatever; the mirrors
	 will have the files soon.)


You can find the files

	glibc-2.0.112.tar.gz
	glibc-2.0.111-2.0.112.diff.gz
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.112.tar.gz


The differences between 2.0.111 and 2.0.112 are almost exclusively bug
fixes and the size of the diff is again caused mainly by documentation
changes.

We don't know about any bugs, except those which are mentioned in the
BUGS file which will not be fixed for 2.1.

The crypt add-on can be found at

	http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pgp/

The 2.0.111 version is fine.


Please let me know about success and failure by a mail to
linux-alpha@cygnus.com.  Please also include information about the
system (processor) since I suspect some problems caused by weak FPU
implementations on AMD chips.

The SPARC math regressions are due to a bug in the fpu emulation code
in the sparc/linux kernel.  I am working on a fix, but because I am in

It is quite impossible to give a tutorial on parsing in an e-mail. You
should fist express your grammar in a formal way. The most popular
formalism for expressing context-free grammars is BNF. This grammar
defines how each construct in the language is constructed. Then you
should define semantic actions for each construct. If you want a realy
quick and dirty start, you can check the bison info file. bison is a
parser generator from an attributed grammar definition. The info file
can give you some idea on how to parse such simple grammars. If you use
it, you will also need to use lex (or flex), the lexical analyzer
generator. But if you want to learn the theory, you should read about
finite automata, languages and regular expressions.
If you don't want to learn the theory, you should read something about
these anyway.

 &gt; same solution that we already use on our other systems. 

 &gt; Does anyone if this can be made to work on Linux?
Which libc are you using?


The following should work with glibc2:
cc -fpic a.o b.o -shared -ly -o libx.so

If this doesn't work with glibc2, please supply a short test (just two
or three simple files) showing the problem.

Sir,
  What you are seeing is two different development trees.

One is for glibc 2.0, the other for glibc 2.1

Generally, if you see something like glibc-XXXX-2.0.Y, where Y is
a single digit, that is a release for glibc 2.0.  If you see something
like glibc-XXXX-2.0.YYY where YYY is two or three digits, that is a test
release for glibc 2.1.  

Also note, 2.0 has been released.  I believe that the current version is
2.0.6, which can be found at ftp.gnu.org.  There are development releases
in the form glibc-2.0.YpreN at alpha.gnu.org.

2.1 has not been released yet, though I can attest it is getting very close.
You can find development copies at alpha.gnu.org.


I apoligize for sending a blank message a few minutes ago.  Slip of the
fingers.

You should at least try to get some understanding on the current

 drepper&gt; current situation before complaining loudly.  None of your
 drepper&gt; points is valid for the LinuxThreads version which currently
 drepper&gt; is released with the glibc test releases.

A simple "fixed in glibc 2.1" would have sufficed.

I do not have a test release of glibc.  I neither know nor
particularly care where to get one.  The "Reporting Bugs" section of
the Texinfo manual does not say, "please make sure your bug hasn't
been fixed in some test release", it says to indicate what version of
glibc you are using (which I did implicitly by indicating "stock Red
Hat Linux 5.2").

I sent my bug report to Xavier (as the LinuxThreads documentation says
to do), bug-glibc (as the glibc documentation says to do), and
linux-gcc (since it is a Linux-specific problem).  Which of these
qualifies as "complaining loudly"?

If you expect some other procedure to be followed when reporting bugs,
you should document such, and not slam someone for following the
procedure you DID document.

I am glad to hear that the problems have been fixed; thanks.

 - Pat

I am now looking at glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.110 (I hope that is current
enough), and the only relevant differences I see are:

  1) The library calls "setrlimit" to set the current stack size limit
     to a little under 2 meg.

  2) There is a "__pthread_nonstandard_stacks" variable which appears
     to allow, in principle, different threads to have different-sized
     stacks.

It seems to me that (1) does not solve the problem, because any user
program that (completely legitimately) calls "setrlimit" itself will
break the library.  This could be fixed by defining STACK_SIZE to be
larger than (or equal to) the kernel-enforced hard limit.

As for (2), the support isn't really there; the variable
__pthread_nonstandard_stacks is initialized to zero and never
modified.  This appears to be the start of a not-yet-finished
interface.

Since "none of my points is valid for the LinuxThreads version which
currently is released with the glibc test releases", I assume I am
missing something.  What is it?

 drepper&gt; int __pthread_attr_setstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t
 drepper&gt; stacksize)

OK, thanks.  I still think I see two problems:

First, manager.c:pthread_allocate_stack() needs to set
__pthread_nonstandard_stacks to 1 if the user provided a stack.
Otherwise, if the user provides a stack which is not aligned to a
multiple of 2M the default thread_self() implementation will not
correctly find the thread data.  I am pretty sure this is an outright
bug (though easy to fix).  Actually, you only need set it if the value
provided by the user is not aligned to a STACK_SIZE boundary, I think.

Second, the value passed to pthread_attr_setstacksize is limited to 2M
(see manager.c line 263).  In other words, each thread (including the
first) is still limited to a stack size of 2M, despite the usual
kernel limit of 8M.  There should be some way to get stack sizes of 8M
with sentinels.  I would even argue that this should be the default,
and that users who need many many threads can write something special
to notify the library.  But even if it is not the default, there
should be *some* way to get the effect.

Yes, I can use pthread_attr_setstackaddr, but what if I need
sentinels?  Do I need to play mmap() games (and if so, how exactly
should I play them)?  It would be nice to have an interface for this,
even a Linux-specific one.

You tried to compile the linuxthreads add-on to glibc without the rest of
glibc.  Get glibc from your favorite mirror of prep, and read and obey the
installation instructions.

There should be a big fat warning in the linuxthreads tarball to this
effect.  Did you read the README like you're supposed to ?

Hmmm.  That's this change, probably:

        * manual/Makefile (examples): Filter out the example code from
        add-ons.

I liked it the way it was before.  Can we go back?

It's particularly difficult because manual/Makefile doesn't include
the sysdep makefiles, as far as I can see, so there's no way to insert
rules to make the examples in the crypt makefile.

&gt;     After that, my egcs can not used.
&gt;     At first, it told me no lib "/usr/local/lib/libc.so.6"

&gt;     It told me no /usr/local/include/stubs.h which included ny feature.h.
&gt; 
&gt;     Can anyone help me to make my egcs can work!

Well, you need to get a working libc and/or egcs from your backup
tapes or distribution CD-ROM.

I will add `make info' to the automated tester.

I haven't changed it without a reason.  `make dist' didn't worked.

&gt; It's particularly difficult because manual/Makefile doesn't include

Maybe all add-on Makefile can get a rule to create manual examples and
manual/Makefile uses these first.

Or: we simply say add-on must not have separate examples.  I don't
think this is unreasonable.

&gt; All true vfork implementations in all systems have had these restrictions,
&gt; whether cleared stated by their documentation or not.  If you think about
&gt; it, the issue is inherent in the memory sharing behavior vfork is specified
&gt; to have.

The Solaris manual page says:

NOTES
     The use of vfork() for any purpose except as a prelude to an
     immediate  call  to  a  function from the exec family, or to
     _exit(), is not advised.

     vfork() is unsafe in multi-thread applications.

     This function will be eliminated in a future  release.   The
     memory  sharing semantics of vfork() can be obtained through
     other mechanisms.

     To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes  that  are
     children  in  the middle of a vfork() are never sent SIGTTOU
     or SIGTTIN signals; rather, output or ioctls are allowed and
     input attempts result in an EOF indication.

     On some systems, the implementation of  vfork()  causes  the
     parent  to inherit register values from the child.  This can
     create  problems  for  certain   optimizing   compilers   if
     &lt;unistd.h&gt; is not included in the source calling vfork().

The Solaris vfork() does not permit the child's computation to be
interleaved with the parent's; after vfork(), the parent cannot run
until the child exits or calls exec.  Except in multi-threaded
applications, when only the calling thread of control is suspended,
see the second paragraph from the manual page.

Well, exactly.  It would be incomprehensibly inane to attempt to have a
vfork that did not behave that way, because of exactly this problem.  It
had not before now entered my mind that Linux might have such a thing as a
vfork where both processes ran simultaneously in the same address space.

The restrictions I referred to are those on the child process not to unwind
stack frames because when the parent resumes later (after the child has
exec'd or exited), its stack pointer will be the same as it was and it will
attempt to unwind into the stack frames the child has clobbered.

&gt; Assume this:
&gt; 
&gt; 	void
&gt; 	bar ()
&gt; 	{
&gt; 	  pid_t p = baz ();
&gt; 	  if (p == 0)
&gt; 	    foo (0);
&gt; 	}
&gt; 	pid_t
&gt; 	baz ()
&gt; 	{
&gt; 	  return vfork ();
&gt; 	}

The Single Unix Specification says:

: The vfork() function has the same effect as fork(),
: except that the behaviour is undefined if the process
: created by vfork() either modifies any data other than
: a variable of type pid_t used to store the return value
: from vfork(), or returns from the function in which
: vfork() was called, or calls any other function before
: successfully calling _exit() or one of the exec family
: of functions. 

So this one is (if I interpret it correctly)
definitly bad code.

Yes.  Return in the child -&gt; the parent's stack pointer is now left pointing 
to unknown data, because the stack is shared but the stack pointers 
(obviously) aren't.  (Unless #define vfork fork.)

vfork() is a horrible kludge.  This is why.

Hello!

A part from a larger project that I have require to me to write a very
simple C program that connect through port 110 to a pop3 server and to
download all messages in a single file. The syntax should be:
$ program user host
and then the program should prompt for password. Then he has to get all
messages into a single local file.

I read RFCs 821 and 822 and I take a look on some examples of others
program but I didn't really approach of the goal. So, please, if anybody
can to help me with the source code of such a simple programm. Some extra
line of comment should be just perfect.

Thx a lot in advance!

   it also prevents the kernel from generating a signal on stack

This is what signal stacks are for, use them.

  Hi,

Im using an unmodified SuSE 6.0 distribution
that comes with glibc 2.0.7 (which SuSE 6.0
modified to make it work with both libc 5
and glibc 2, I think). "ldd --version" just
says "2.0.7" and "ld --version" says "2.9.1"
if that matters.

My problem is that I'm using the iODBC library,
which is a bit special as it defines a number
of functions (namely those defined by the ODBC
standard) and loads a library for a specific
data base connection. This specific library also
has to defines all the functions of the ODBC
standard (and it couldn't work otherwise). If
I link my program statically with iODBC, I have
no problems, but when I link it dynamically, the
Linux linker gets it wrong, because the specific
ODBC driver (PostgreSQL ODBC to be precise, but
it could be any) also happen to call a few of
the ODBC functions internally and it aims to call
the ODBC functions defined in the driver, not
in iODBC, but ldd sends the calls to iODBC and
my program to heaven.

I post this to both linux-gcc and SuSE as I don't 
know where the bug was introduced (guessing on
SuSE).

I'd be thankful for a reply (sent to me, I'm not
subscribed to this list).

From: Ulrich Drepper &lt;drepper@cygnus.com&gt;
Date: 15 Jan 1999 09:56:28 -0800
Subject: vfork specs

Implementing the vfork syscall wrapper in the libc apparently provides
some problems.  To find a solution it's necessary to get a
specification of vfork, or at least make one up for Linux.

The problem is this: the vfork'ed process using the same VM as the
initial process.  Assume the following code for now:

      void
      bar ()
      {
	if ((pid = vfork ()) == 0)
	  foo (0);
	else if (pid == -1)
	  ...error...

When calling the vfork wrapper we have the following stack layout:

	...something...
	return address bar after vfork call

Now the child returns from the vfork call and calls `foo' with the
resulting layout:

	...something...
	0
	return address bar after foo call

May `foo' then exit and so the parent process starts and it sees the
return address 0 (zero) which was pushed as a parameter for `foo'.

This certainly is a situation we have to deal with and make sure that
the return address from the `vfork' syscall stays valid.  But this is
only have of the story.  It gets complicated if the use of the vfork
is not restricted.  Assume this:

	void
	bar ()
	{
	  pid_t p = baz ();
	  if (p == 0)
	    foo (0);
	}
	pid_t
	baz ()
	{
	  return vfork ();
	}

Now the stack layout when reachine the syscall wrapper is

	...something...
	return address bar after baz call
	return address baz after vfork call

At the time the function foo is called the stack layout is

	...something...
	0
	return address bar after foo call

I.e., we are again f*cked.  This can of course be repeated for
arbitrary depths of function calls.


So the question is: does the vfork interface on other platforms
restricts the use of vfork to situations like the first example and
disallows the second one (or even deeper nestings)?  I think this is
what the Solaris man page says.

Dear all,
     I compiled glibc 2.0.110 with no error messages.
     When I installed it, it told me:

    After that, my egcs can not used.
    At first, it told me no lib "/usr/local/lib/libc.so.6"
    When I linked libc.2.0.7.so to /usr/local/lib/libc.so.6
    It told me no /usr/local/include/stubs.h which included ny feature.h.

    Can anyone help me to make my egcs can work!

&gt; All true vfork implementations in all systems have had these restrictions,
&gt; whether cleared stated by their documentation or not.  If you think about
&gt; it, the issue is inherent in the memory sharing behavior vfork is specified
&gt; to have.

The Solaris manual page says:

NOTES
     The use of vfork() for any purpose except as a prelude to an
     immediate  call  to  a  function from the exec family, or to
     _exit(), is not advised.

     vfork() is unsafe in multi-thread applications.

     This function will be eliminated in a future  release.   The
     memory  sharing semantics of vfork() can be obtained through
     other mechanisms.

     To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes  that  are
     children  in  the middle of a vfork() are never sent SIGTTOU
     or SIGTTIN signals; rather, output or ioctls are allowed and
     input attempts result in an EOF indication.

     On some systems, the implementation of  vfork()  causes  the
     parent  to inherit register values from the child.  This can
     create  problems  for  certain   optimizing   compilers   if
     &lt;unistd.h&gt; is not included in the source calling vfork().

The Solaris vfork() does not permit the child's computation to be
interleaved with the parent's; after vfork(), the parent cannot run
until the child exits or calls exec.  Except in multi-threaded
applications, when only the calling thread of control is suspended,
see the second paragraph from the manual page.

Hmmm.  That's this change, probably:

        * manual/Makefile (examples): Filter out the example code from
        add-ons.

I liked it the way it was before.  Can we go back?

It's particularly difficult because manual/Makefile doesn't include
the sysdep makefiles, as far as I can see, so there's no way to insert
rules to make the examples in the crypt makefile.

&gt; After that, my egcs can not used.

Well, you need to get a working libc and/or egcs from your backup
tapes or distribution CD-ROM.

I will add `make info' to the automated tester.

I haven't changed it without a reason.  `make dist' didn't worked.

Maybe all add-on Makefile can get a rule to create manual examples and
manual/Makefile uses these first.

Or: we simply say add-on must not have separate examples.  I don't
think this is unreasonable.

glibc 2.0.6 is the last officially released version, glibc 2.0.110 is

Well, exactly.  It would be incomprehensibly inane to attempt to have a
vfork that did not behave that way, because of exactly this problem.  It
had not before now entered my mind that Linux might have such a thing as a
vfork where both processes ran simultaneously in the same address space.

The restrictions I referred to are those on the child process not to unwind
stack frames because when the parent resumes later (after the child has
exec'd or exited), its stack pointer will be the same as it was and it will
attempt to unwind into the stack frames the child has clobbered.

Yes.  Return in the child -&gt; the parent's stack pointer is now left pointing
to unknown data, because the stack is shared but the stack pointers
(obviously) aren't.  (Unless #define vfork fork.)

vfork() is a horrible kludge.  This is why.

Perhaps you misunderstanded me, or I did not post it clearly.
What I want to know is:
     The Default include path and lib path.
When I use old gcc.2.7.3, it worked. But when I use new egcs.1.1.1(I
compiled before), it told me some lib error. When I use old gcc.2.7.3
to compile egcs.1.1.1 again, the stage1 passed, but when
stage1/xgcc compile itself, it told me:

./gencheck: can't resolve symbol '_dl_global_scope_end'
./gencheck: can't resolve symbol '_dl_default_scope'

And another error:

c-parse.y: In function `yyparse':

Perhaps the first error was somthing about the lib, but what's the reason

Sir,
  What you are seeing is two different development trees.

One is for glibc 2.0, the other for glibc 2.1

Generally, if you see something like glibc-XXXX-2.0.Y, where Y is
a single digit, that is a release for glibc 2.0.  If you see something
like glibc-XXXX-2.0.YYY where YYY is two or three digits, that is a test
release for glibc 2.1.

Also note, 2.0 has been released.  I believe that the current version is
2.0.6, which can be found at ftp.gnu.org.  There are development releases
in the form glibc-2.0.YpreN at alpha.gnu.org.

2.1 has not been released yet, though I can attest it is getting very close.
You can find development copies at alpha.gnu.org.


I apoligize for sending a blank message a few minutes ago.  Slip of the
fingers.

Hello!

A part from a larger project that I have require to me to write a very

Subject: LinuxThreads stack layout is not good

The appended program, when run on a stock Red Hat 5.2 system, produces
incorrect output after allocating approximately 6 megs of stack space.
Output appears after the program.  (Don't forget "-lpthread" if you
compile it yourself.)

The problem is that the LinuxThreads library sets its internal notion
of STACK_SIZE to a constant 2M.  It subtracts twice STACK_SIZE from
the initial value of the stack pointer and rounds down to a multiple
of STACK_SIZE to figure out a nominal "bottom-of-stack" value
for the initial thread.

It uses this bottom-of-stack value for two things.

First, it uses it to figure out which thread is calling into the
library (e.g., for thread_self() and for thread specific data); this
is the problem illustrated by the test case below.  Once esp goes
below the bottom-of-stack value, the library no longer knows that the
calling thread is the initial thread.  (A stock Red Hat system has a
stack size rlimit of 8M.)

Second, it uses the initial thread bottom-of-stack as the top of an
array of contiguously allocated STACK_SIZE chunks, which serve as the
stacks for additional threads.  That is, the second, third,
etc. threads will have stacks which are contiguously allocated below
the nominal bottom-of-stack of the initial thread.  If the stack size
rlimit is greater than 2M, this means each thread will have a stack
overlapping that of some other thread.

This is a Bad Thing.  Not only does it limit each thread's stack usage
to a compiled-in constant of 2M (a value neither detectable nor
settable through getrlimit/setrlimit), it also prevents the kernel
from generating a signal on stack overflow for most threads.  And
while that may be fine for C, it creates a royal pain for people (like
us) who are trying to implement a safe language on top of
LinuxThreads.

I think two things need to happen to fix these problems.

First, STACK_SIZE in LinuxThreads needs to default to a value greater
than the kernel-determined hard rlimit (under Linux, I believe this is
8M).  I realize this will reduce the number of threads you can create,
so perhaps STACK_SIZE should be settable at run-time as part of an
advanced LinuxThreads-specific interface.  Either way, having some
lower value hard-wired in is truly irritating.

Second, LinuxThreads should leave some amount of unallocated,
inaccessible memory between the stacks of the various threads.
Whether that is 4K or 8M, I don't care; it just needs to be an
advertised value so that we can write proper stack probes when
allocating stack space.  (Yes, in JIT-compiled code we could just test
the esp every time, but some of our code is written in C, and all we
can do there is place bounds on the local variable space used.)
Without these sentinels, it is a real pain to guarantee that a user
cannot violate the safety of the language.

Thanks for your time.

A simple "fixed in glibc 2.1" would have sufficed.

I do not have a test release of glibc.  I neither know nor
particularly care where to get one.  The "Reporting Bugs" section of
the Texinfo manual does not say, "please make sure your bug hasn't
been fixed in some test release", it says to indicate what version of
glibc you are using (which I did implicitly by indicating "stock Red
Hat Linux 5.2").

I sent my bug report to Xavier (as the LinuxThreads documentation says
to do), bug-glibc (as the glibc documentation says to do), and
linux-gcc (since it is a Linux-specific problem).  Which of these
qualifies as "complaining loudly"?

If you expect some other procedure to be followed when reporting bugs,
you should document such, and not slam someone for following the
procedure you DID document.

I am glad to hear that the problems have been fixed; thanks.

I am now looking at glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.110 (I hope that is current
enough), and the only relevant differences I see are:

  1) The library calls "setrlimit" to set the current stack size limit
     to a little under 2 meg.

  2) There is a "__pthread_nonstandard_stacks" variable which appears
     to allow, in principle, different threads to have different-sized
     stacks.

It seems to me that (1) does not solve the problem, because any user
program that (completely legitimately) calls "setrlimit" itself will
break the library.  This could be fixed by defining STACK_SIZE to be
larger than (or equal to) the kernel-enforced hard limit.

As for (2), the support isn't really there; the variable
__pthread_nonstandard_stacks is initialized to zero and never
modified.  This appears to be the start of a not-yet-finished
interface.

Since "none of my points is valid for the LinuxThreads version which
currently is released with the glibc test releases", I assume I am
missing something.  What is it?

 drepper&gt; stacksize)

OK, thanks.  I still think I see two problems:

First, manager.c:pthread_allocate_stack() needs to set
__pthread_nonstandard_stacks to 1 if the user provided a stack.
Otherwise, if the user provides a stack which is not aligned to a
multiple of 2M the default thread_self() implementation will not
correctly find the thread data.  I am pretty sure this is an outright
bug (though easy to fix).  Actually, you only need set it if the value
provided by the user is not aligned to a STACK_SIZE boundary, I think.

Second, the value passed to pthread_attr_setstacksize is limited to 2M
(see manager.c line 263).  In other words, each thread (including the
first) is still limited to a stack size of 2M, despite the usual
kernel limit of 8M.  There should be some way to get stack sizes of 8M
with sentinels.  I would even argue that this should be the default,
and that users who need many many threads can write something special
to notify the library.  But even if it is not the default, there
should be *some* way to get the effect.

Yes, I can use pthread_attr_setstackaddr, but what if I need
sentinels?  Do I need to play mmap() games (and if so, how exactly
should I play them)?  It would be nice to have an interface for this,
even a Linux-specific one.

On Solaris and SCO system V we create a library with a line like:

	cc -fpic a.o b.o -ly -o libx.so

then when we load libx with dlopen() it also loads liby.so.
On Linux we have been unable to get this to work. There are
possible workarounds, but we would like to stick with the
same solution that we already use on our other systems.

Does anyone if this can be made to work on Linux?

Which libc are you using?


The following should work with glibc2:
cc -fpic a.o b.o -shared -ly -o libx.so

If this doesn't work with glibc2, please supply a short test (just two
or three simple files) showing the problem.

Subject: ldd bug

  Hi,

Im using an unmodified SuSE 6.0 distribution
that comes with glibc 2.0.7 (which SuSE 6.0
modified to make it work with both libc 5
and glibc 2, I think). "ldd --version" just
says "2.0.7" and "ld --version" says "2.9.1"
if that matters.

My problem is that I'm using the iODBC library,
which is a bit special as it defines a number
of functions (namely those defined by the ODBC
standard) and loads a library for a specific
data base connection. This specific library also
has to defines all the functions of the ODBC
standard (and it couldn't work otherwise). If
I link my program statically with iODBC, I have
no problems, but when I link it dynamically, the
Linux linker gets it wrong, because the specific
ODBC driver (PostgreSQL ODBC to be precise, but
it could be any) also happen to call a few of
the ODBC functions internally and it aims to call
the ODBC functions defined in the driver, not
in iODBC, but ldd sends the calls to iODBC and
my program to heaven.

I post this to both linux-gcc and SuSE as I don't
know where the bug was introduced (guessing on
SuSE).

I'd be thankful for a reply (sent to me, I'm not
subscribed to this list).

Oops. I was missing the obvious. Due to an error in the makefile it wasn't
looking it in the right area for the libraries and I misinterpreted the
linker errors.

Subject: C++ Destructor Question

Being spoiled by Java's garbage collector leads me to this quick
question again concerning constructors in C++.

If I allocate memory via "new" using a constructor

i.e.

    class Foo
    {
      Foo()
        { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }

      ~Foo()
        { delete word; }

        ...
     }

When I create an object of class Foo memory will be allocated for the
char buffer "word". Now when the object is no longer needed must I
make an explicit call to the destructor ~Foo() to destroy the object
and subsequently call "delete", or, is the destructor somehow called
automatically when the object is no  longer needed,i.e.  outside of
it's scope?

Even in Java there are times when it is up to you to destroy an object
and/or free memory used for that object, depending on how the object
is/was created and an method equivalent of a destructor is required...
The garbage collector is not always adequate.

Thanks...

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: C++ Destructor Question

Hi,
The destructor is automatically called when the
object in question is no longer needed. Such as
an object is created inside a function locally and
when the function returns the object gets killed with
the destructor executed. Hence we dont call the
destructor explicitly.

And in java I feel the garbage collection concept is
implemented quite strong and rarely do we use explicit
deallocation.

Subject: Re: C++ Destructor Question

In C++ you must always specifically call the destructor before the
variable goes out of scope.  When it goes out of scope the variable name
and the memory it points to become unlinked and there is no way for you to
go back and free that memory.  That's how you get memory leaks :)

&gt; i.e.
&gt; 
&gt; class Foo
&gt; {
&gt; Foo()
&gt; { word = new char[LENGTH + 1];  }
&gt; 
&gt; ~Foo()
&gt; { delete word; }
&gt; 
&gt; ...

I think the above is a bit confusing. THe question was about calling the
destructor and then something about scope.

But talking about scope is confusing, since what you are talking about is
the pointers scope ... not the dynamically allocated object (would that
even make sense ... i.e. can you talk about the scope of a dynamic object
?)

Certainly memory leaks if an only pointer to some object goes out of scope
... but in many cases this doesn't matter since some other pointer will be
passed the address of the object in question.

Anyway, as Suresh pointed out, when a dynamic object is deleted it's
destructor is implicitly called.

To sum up the ways objects are destroyed:

1 When a dynamic object is deleted, the destructor is called IMPLICITLY

2 An automatic object (on the stack AFAIK) or static object will be
destroyed automatically, when it goes out of scope - i.e. at the end of a
block or at program termination, and then the destructor is called
IMPLICITLY.

The example below should serve as illustration. Three objects are created
in different ways. All are destroyed, but none explicitly. Actually, you
only rarely call the destructor EXPLICITLY, but take a look at:

http://www.cerfnet.com/~mpcline/C++-FAQs-Lite/

- -------------------------
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

class foo
{
	int x;

public:
        foo(int _x):x(_x) {}
        ~foo() { cout &lt;&lt; "I am destroyed: " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt;endl; }
};

foo z(1);

main()
{
        foo * x = new foo(2);
        delete x;
        foo y(3);
}
 -------
I am destroyed: 2
I am destroyed: 3
I am destroyed: 1

The destructor of an object is automatically called when the object goes
out of scope. There's no need to "specifically call the destructor" (which
I think you mean 'explicitly').

&gt; &gt;     class Foo

Can you tell me how I store my objects, vector or set or individual

&gt; Coming back to your original question: vectors can be used to

It is different. When I re-allocate my array, I know the address is 
invalid, I can do something to keep the correct addresses. But in vector,
when I push_back an element to vector, I do not know the addresses I keeped 
is valid or not.

&gt; If you do not modify the vector in a certain number of ways (extending

If I can not extend it, I will use array, what is the goodness of 
vector?

Hi,

the attached tarball demonstrates the failure of deleting static elements in
classes, if the library that contains these class is unloaded with dlclose.

My question is whether this is a glibc (libdl) bug or a bug in generating the
code (egcs).

System is Linux kernel 2.2.0, glibc 2.0.111, gcc version egcs-2.91.58 19981101
(egcs-1.1.1 pre-release).

Bug showed up in all older versions of kernel, libc and egcs.

If this bug is known could you please point me to a fix.

If this bug is unknown I likely want to know, if it could be fixed in the recent
future.

Best regards,
    Harald Hoyer

I am linking a number of executables against a shared library that I've built,
and some the executables contain code that collides with symbols defined in the
shared library for both function names and some static data in the shared obj.
I have a few questions about how to control the linkage here.

Initially I was having all kinds of namespace collisions between .  By using a
version script like

    youch.so.0.0 {
        global:
            entry1;
            entry2;
            entry3;
            entry4;
        local:
            *;
    };

I was able to avoid the function cross-linkage (I think).  However, it appears
that I am still having cross-linkage problems with some static data in my shared
object, where the code from the executable seems to be accessing static data
that should be for the shared object (or vice versa).  Stripping the shared
object before linking against it doesn't seem to help.


Questions:
     - Is linking the shared object specifing the --version-script the proper
way to hide the symbols that I don't want to export?  That's what the ld info
seemed to be saying, but it was a bit confusing.
     - Should the version script above hide my data as well as the functions,
i.e., is this apparent cross-linkage on static data the expected behavior in
this case?
     - Is there a way to make the link happen the way I want it, i.e. references
to global data in the code in the shared object and in the objects statically
linked into the executable are resolved to the symbols in their respective data
segments?


Any help with these questions would be appeciated, as would any pointers to
further documentation.

Thanks

Yes, the Alpha problems with single precision complex are
a compiler problem.  The solution I had appears to be only

Hi,

I've uploaded to

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
and
	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu
and
	ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

(where XX is your country code) the latest test release of glibc
2.1.1.  It'll hopefully be the last for 2.1.1.  The files to download
are

	glibc-2.1.1pre1-2.1.1pre2.diff.gz

	(or glibc-2.1.1pre2.tar.gz if you need the whole tarball)
and
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.1pre2.tar.gz

The crypt add-on hasn't changed, use the 2.1 version.

New in this release:

- lots of bug fixes

   Beside general one also several specific to Arm.

- SPARC optimizations by Jakub Jelinek

- more Hurd changes (Roland, Mark)

- fix of a few compatibility problems

- several locale data extensions

- updates for charmaps according to current Unicode converison tables
  (a lot Euro stuff)

- many performance improvements (mainly by me); startup times of applications
  should be reduced measurably


Give it a try.  I'm quite comfortable with this version and if no
problems are reported it'll go out as 2.1.1.

	Hi, 

	I tried to build glibc-2.0.122 and after about 2 hours of compiling
	time everything seemed to be ok. I compiled glibc with 2.2.1 kernel
	header files, although my system is running kernel 2.0.30, and installed
	it in /usr/local. 

	Here is part of my configuration used to build glibc:

	o egcs 1.1.1 (egc-2.91.60)
	o binutils 2.9.1.0.25
	o ld 1.9.9
	o GNU Make 3.71.1
	o libc 5.4.33

	Now, when I'm trying to run the simpe foo.c program:

	void main(void) {}

	which is compiled as:

	$ gcc foo.c -Wl,--dynamic-linker=/usr/lib/ld.linux.so.2 -o foo 

	I'm getting the following 'strange' msg:

	$ ./foo
	bash: ./foo: No such file or directory

	I've also included /usr/local/lib in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env.
	variable.

	Also, when I try the following:

	bash# nm -u foo
	__mon_start__
	__ibc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.0
	_p_hw
	abort@@GLIBC_2.0
	free@@GLIBC_2.0
	malloc@@GLIBC_2.0

	Any ideas?

	If I'm asking in the wrong place I would appreciate u pointing me
	to the appropriate one. TIA. :-)

	Best Regards,
	Elias

    Just some ideas.

Well, of course I sent it to the list because I think it is
a kernel bug. It smells like one.

Hardware? Three days old. One crash. Very heavy use at the
moment of crash. Two ethernet cards were transferring Gigabytes
from one machine to another. Gcc was active. Netscape was active.
I started yast and the machine crashed the same moment.

Bad memory? Have not had time for memtest86. Have read two 17 GB disks
several times with  dd if=/dev/disk | md5sum  and find consistent answers.
Have simultaneously tarred and untarred some trees and compiled some
kernels - no problems. There are no typical signs of flaky hardware.
(This is a Pentium II, 256 MB.)

Miscompilation? Well as I said, this was a fresh SuSE 6.1 install,
and the gcc that comes with it says

# cc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)

Miscompilation is a definite possibility. This version of cc
is certainly somewhat broken - it sometimes produces strange warnings.
I don't know whether it produces bad code.

Let me show you an example of egcs-2.91.66 behaviour:
----------------------------- foo.c ------------------------------------

void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
        __attribute__ ((noreturn, format (printf, 1, 2)));

void printk(const char * fmt, ...)
        __attribute__ ((format (printf, 1, 2)));


struct SC {
     void (*fn)(int);
};

extern int get_int(void);
extern struct SC * get_SC(void);

void
foo() {
     int mbo;
     struct SC * p = get_SC();

     if(!p) panic("Ouch!");

     while (1){

          mbo = get_int();

          if (mbo &lt; 0) {
               printk("%d\n", mbo);
               return;
          }

          if (p-&gt;fn)
               (p-&gt;fn)(0);
          else
               printk("fn NULL?\n");
     }
}
-----------------------------------------------------

# cc -Wall -O2 -c foo.c
foo.c: In function `foo':
foo.c:18: warning: `mbo' might be used uninitialized in this function
#

Strange.. - mbo is used after an assignment to it.
How can it be uninitialized?
And the strange part is, this is a minimal example:
every simplification of this example makes the complaint go away.
(Changing fn to be  void (*fn)(void); or deleting the
 `else printk("fn NULL?\n");' part, or deleting the `return;',
 or changing the panic into a printk.
 Also deleting the -O2 flag makes the complaint go away.)

So, egcs-2.91.66 with -O2 is confused about the flow of control.
With some phantasy I can imagine that, once confused, gcc manages
to optimize away some code that is necessary, or miscompile in
some other way.

I'll cc this to linux-gcc and egcs-bugs@egcs.cygnus.com.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.4 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0801 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I merged a MIPS gas patch from binutils 2.9.1.0.25 to the current
binutils and there are many changes in MIPS/ELF in bfd. I'd like to
hear reports on Linux/MIPS.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.4 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

Release 2.1.2 of the GNU C library is now available at

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
and
	ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

(where XX is your country code) and all the mirror sites of these
servers around the world.

It would also be available at 

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc

but somebody removed my account on this machine.  Too bad.  It is
unreliable anyway.


The new files are

	glibc-2.1.2.tar.gz
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.2.tar.gz

together with a patch relative to the 2.1.1 release

	glibc-2.1.1-2.1.2.diff.gz

There are also .bz2 files available which should be preferred to
preserve bandwidth.

The crypt add-on hasn't changed and therefore the version from release
2.1 should be used.

	glibc-crypt-2.1.tar.gz

The crypt add-on is available from

	ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/glibc


There is no localedata add-on anymore as there was in glibc 2.0.  Don't
use the add-on from glibc 2.0, the necessary data already comes with the
main tar file.

This release of the library runs on the following targets:

	*-*-gnu			GNU Hurd
	i[3456]86-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on Intel
	m68k-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on Motorola 680x0
	alpha-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on DEC Alpha
	powerpc-*-linux-gnu     Linux and MkLinux on PowerPC systems
	sparc-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on SPARC
	sparc64-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on UltraSPARC
	arm-*-none		ARM standalone systems
	arm-*-linux		Linux-2.x on ARM
	arm-*-linuxaout		Linux-2.x on ARM using a.out binaries

Work on ports to mips-*-linux-gnu, sparc-sun-solaris, and mips-sgi-irix6
are under way but need more work.  Help to finish the ports is welcome.


The 2.1.2 fixes several problems from former releases and is consider
very stable and reliable.  Immediately upgrading from prior versions
is encouraged.

*BUT*: updating the C library is no trivial task and it is very easy
to damage one's system.  Therefore, persons who do not exactly know
what to do, should consider using a binary distribution instead, when
they become available.  All major Linux distributors will hopefully
base their next release on glibc 2.1.2.  Don't tell us you haven't been
warned.  Another reason why not everybody should think about compiling
glibc is the disk and CPU requirements: on Intel platforms the full
build requires about 290MB plus the space you need to install it.
This number is probably higher on RISC platforms.  During the
compilation the compiler will need large amounts of virtual memory.
We are talking about 100MB on Intel and 200MB on Alpha.  If using the
`-j' option of make this numbers grow linearly.  Compiling takes more
than 4 hours on a i586@133, and still 45 minutes on a 2xi686@233.  See
the FAQ file for more numbers.

In case you decide to compile glibc yourself you need to read the file
INSTALL.  It will explain among other things which tools are
necessary.  The most important one is the compiler.  Although other
versions might work it is recommended to get gcc 2.96.  But see the
FAQ for expected failures.  In case of a problem during the
compilation with a compiler other than gcc 2.96 get the recommended
version first (at http://sourceware.cygnus.com).  This is especially
true for gcc 2.7.2.3 which (some people believe) is a usable compiler.
But in fact it is extremely buggy and will definitely fail to compile
glibc on every platform.


The 2.1.2 release should be binary compatible with the 2.0 release.
All programs should continue to run.  There are only a few exceptions:

- some shared libraries have to be updated as well.  They are using
  details from the libc.  These libraries include the C++ library
  (libstdc++) and the curses library.  See the FAQ for more information.
  Programs using these libraries are not effected.  The number of
  problems should be significantly lower with the 2.1.2 release than
  they were with 2.1 and 2.1.1.

- some programs use *internal* symbols of the C library.  These names of
  these symbols all start with an underscore and the reason why these
  symbols are "internal" is because they change or might fall away in
  new versions of the library.  And this did happen a lot.  Don't even
  think about complaining on the libc lists about this, the programmers
  of these applications made the errors.  We have now mechanisms in
  place which will prevent this from happening again even in the presence
  of programmers unwilling to follow the rules.

For people using old pre-2.0 snapshots (this particularly affects
PowerPC users, for a while the standard glibc on powerpc was a 961212
snapshot), note that all 2.x versions are binary incompatible with
pre-2.0 snapshots.  In general, binary compatibility is not guaranteed
if you use unreleased versions of glibc.


Problems should all be reported using the `glibcbug' shell script.  Simply
run this script, fill out the information and you are set.  If at the time
you start the script it complains like this

	/usr/bin/glibcbug: emacs: command not found

simply set one of the environment variables EDITOR and VISUAL (this should
happen on every system automatically):

	env EDITOR=vi glibcbug

Before sending a bug report make sure you have read the BUGS and the
FAQ file which come with the glibc sources.  You won't even get an
answer if it is obvious you haven't read these files.  It is also
helpful to scan the appropriate newsgroups and mailing lists to see
whether somebody else already had this problem.  We also have a bug
report database with an web interface at

	http://www-gnats.gnu.ai.mit.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl

It is very easy to browse and chances are somebody already reported
the problem.  There is another thing we don't want to hear about: the
size.  glibc is big, but this is necessary for a multi-platform Unix
library.


For this release I fortunately again could count on the help of
several people.  In purely random order:

	Mark Kettenis
	Geoff Keating
	Christian Gafton
	Zack Weinberg
	Thorsten Kukuk
	Andreas Schwab
	Roland McGrath
	Richard Henderson
	Philip Blundell
	Andreas Jaeger
	H.J. Lu

The list with the changes below contains a few more names.  Please
remember those names for the day you have the opportunity to thank
them.

Changes include:

- corrections to math functions

- nscd works on SPARC ad Alpha

- malloc checks parameter

- many Hurd changes

- printf function fixes (mostly wide char related)

- header cleanups

- performance improvements

- dynamic memory cleanups

- correct return values of reentrant netdb functions (returns now error
  code, not -1).  Attention when recompiling X since it uses these
  functions incorrectly.

- fix some wide character string functions

- documentation updates

- cookie stdio streams now work

- getaddrinfo should work now

- the dynamic loader should now be absolutely thread-safe

- several character set conversion modules were corrected

- librt works a bit better despite the broken signal handling model of
  the Linux kernel

- putenv corrected according to common practice and standards
  (programs using putenv incorrectly might have some problems)

- some security fixes

- many more bug fixes


There is no reported bug left which can be fixed in this release.
There are only a few bigger (and non-critical) problems left which
either wait for a volunteer to be done or will be fixed with the glibc
2.2 release.

Hi, Folks,

This is the beta release of gdb 4.17.0.14, which is based on gdb 4.17
plus Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint/FPU, glibc 2 pthread and Linux/PPC
support. You need linux 2.0.35 or above, or 2.1.xx to get the x86 FPU
to work correctly. The Linux/x86 binary works with all recent kernels
and C libraries, and the x86 FPU support is enabled at the run-time,
depending on the kernel version.

You need the latest glibc 2.1.1 to debug LinuxThreads.

Special thanks to Dan Bethe who provided the PowePC notebook which
makes the LinuxPPC support in gdb possible.

Please report any bugs related to gdb 4.17.0.14 to hjl@lucon.org.

Problems:

Because most of system calls in glibc 2 are written in assembly without
frame pointer, gdb may not be able to debug nor get stack trace system
calls on glibc-based 2 systems. Due to this, "make check" may fail in

FAIL: gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: backtrace through signal handler
FAIL: gdb.base/signals.exp: bt in signals.exp

with glibc 2.

Also, it is normal to see 

FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: continue (timeout)
FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: echo data (timeout)

if there is

XPASS: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: send_gdb end of file

Due to the new cplus-dem.c from gcc 2.95.1, you will get a few

FAIL: gdb.c++/demangle.exp: maint demangle __xxxxxxxxxx

to the CLONE_PTRACE change to pthread in glibc 2.1.
2. Add support for the older Linux C libraries.
3. Add -static support for glibc 2.1.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.5:

bonjour

j ai lu avec interet votre document sur gcc, mais j ai un probleme:
je travaille avec un redhat 6.0 ( et qui est une mise a jour d une Redhat 5.2)
je n ai pas fait de "bidouilles", ni avant la mise a jour, ni apres
or lorsque je lance gcc j obtiens:

BUG IN DYNAMIC LINKER ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 57: elf_get_dynamic_info: Assertion `! \
"bad dynamic tag"' failed!

(et ce, que je tape "gcc" ou que je lance une compilation du noyau!)

Je vous serai reconnaissant de m aider a resoudre ce probleme

merci

I _think_ RedHat 6.0 and 6.1 shipped with egcs as the c compiler, so if
you installed it (rpm -q egcs to check) and glibc-devel, you should be
right to just say CC=egcs  ... egcs is roughly the same as gcc-2.95, I
think.  If you want to build gcc anyway, egcs should be adequate for the
job.  You shouldn't need the stage1/stage2 stuff.  Just ./configure make
make install.

gcc is written in c, so (catch 22) you need a c compiler to build it,
either an earlier version of gcc, or an ansi c compiler native to the OS
you are building it for.

Red Hat came down with both feet for glibc with RH 5.0, and I think that
was a good choice.  Maybe we'll all learn to know and love egcs in time,
too.  Just don't try to compile a 2.0.x kernel with it - or with
gcc-2.95 either, for that matter.  Slackware now uses gcc for c, and
egcs for c++.

&gt; I'm hoping someone can help me out with what must be a simple problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently upgraded to the RedHat 6.1 linux distribution (up from 5.2)
and
&gt; apparently didn't install GCC from the cd while doing so. As the
computer
&gt; itself is hard for me to get to, I'm trying to compile and install gcc
the
&gt; old fashioned way (download the tarball, configure, make, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; When I run gcc's configure script, it complains that I need a working
&gt; compiler (to which env var CC must be set). This poses an interesting
&gt; problem, since the whole point of this is to build install a compiler!
&gt; 
&gt; Under the previous linux version, everthing was fine and I used gcc all
the
&gt; time, relatively painlessly.
&gt; 
&gt; I work with interpreted languages and web services, so all this c stuff
is
&gt; a little bit voodoo for me, but I must be missing something terribly
simple
&gt; here. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?

Do you really mean 2.96? I already have 2.95-1 and I have seen no

You are right, it's 2.95.1.

I try compiling glibc 2.1.2 with --host/build/target=i686-pc-linux-gnu

configured? The processor is an AMD 5x86.

Also a ix86-linux-gnu related queston; at every processor upgrade I
must recompile these things with the actual ix86-pc string, or I don't
miss nothing when I use the -i486-pc-linux-gnu compiled utils on a

My real question is the reverse of this problem.
What is, when I compile a libc for better processor, like compiling
for i686 on an i486? I miss something, or not, when I use the new libc
on the i686?
I want compile a libc that usable on every i4-686 processor, and also
gcc, binutils. I must do this for every type of processor, or I can do
it on a 486, without any feature missing?

MIPS users should continue to use the latest 2.8.1-based releases
available from ftp.linux.sgi.com.  All newer linker have heavy bugs
which will result in linker crashes, bad kernels and more.  I especially
have to warn about the binutils from Cygnus' anonymous CVS.  At this
time the MIPS support in that binutils versions is undergoing heavy
rewrite in order to support the N32 ABI and as a temporary side effect

	Hi, 

	I tried to build glibc-2.0.122 and after about 2 hours of compiling
	time everything seemed to be ok. I compiled glibc with 2.2.1 kernel
	header files, although my system is running kernel 2.0.30, and installed
	it in /usr/local. 

	Here is part of my configuration used to build glibc:

	o egcs 1.1.1 (egc-2.91.60)
	o binutils 2.9.1.0.25
	o ld 1.9.9
	o GNU Make 3.71.1
	o libc 5.4.33

	Now, when I'm trying to run the simpe foo.c program:

	void main(void) {}

	which is compiled as:

	$ gcc foo.c -Wl,--dynamic-linker=/usr/lib/ld.linux.so.2 -o foo 

	I'm getting the following 'strange' msg:

	$ ./foo
	bash: ./foo: No such file or directory

	I've also included /usr/local/lib in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env.
	variable.

	Also, when I try the following:

	bash# nm -u foo
	__mon_start__
	__ibc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.0
	_p_hw
	abort@@GLIBC_2.0
	free@@GLIBC_2.0
	malloc@@GLIBC_2.0

	Any ideas?

	If I'm asking in the wrong place I would appreciate u pointing me
	to the appropriate one. TIA. :-)

You should really install glibc 2.1.1 and read the whole FAQ and
INSTALL documents first.

Thank you.

Is there some page somewhere that tracks the current status of glibc2?

o	The FSF glibc page still says that 2.0 is the latest.

o	The FSF ftp archive still says that 2.1 is withdrawn due to
	political issues.

o	http://glibc.cygnus.com/ takes me to the EGCS page, which makes no
	mention of glibc.

Basically a lot of people have no clue where to find 2.1, and some of us
who do know where it is are not sure whether we ought to use it.  I think
you'd get more testers if these issues were resolved.

Hello,

I'm hoping someone can help me out with what must be a simple problem.

I recently upgraded to the RedHat 6.1 linux distribution (up from 5.2) and
apparently didn't install GCC from the cd while doing so. As the computer
itself is hard for me to get to, I'm trying to compile and install gcc the
old fashioned way (download the tarball, configure, make, etc.)

When I run gcc's configure script, it complains that I need a working
compiler (to which env var CC must be set). This poses an interesting
problem, since the whole point of this is to build install a compiler!

Under the previous linux version, everthing was fine and I used gcc all the
time, relatively painlessly.

I work with interpreted languages and web services, so all this c stuff is
a little bit voodoo for me, but I must be missing something terribly simple
here. 

Any thoughts? 

Thanks,

- Andrew

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.22 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 1202 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.22 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

Hi,

A recent news item announced the release of "Blood of the Damned", a computer game \
which has "a mysterious sect of bloodsuckers and baby snatchers". In another news \
item, Brazilian police were said to be investigating whether "Duke Nukem" induced a \
medical student to go on a killing spree.

One wonders what these games are teaching youngsters about their attitude towards \
people in the real world. I'm NOT thinking of starting a National Campaign Against \
Violent Computer Games (how's NACAPAGVICOMGA for an acronym) but is it too much to \
hope that if enough parents were to encourage their children to find better uses for \
the PC, the tide of violence might be stemmed?

One suitable alternative would be to give youngsters the chance to create their own \
sites on the World Wide Web. That is now within everyone's reach. Facilities of high \
quality at low cost are provided, together with free Web design tools and Internet \
training, at http://www.skyboom.com/amsek/.

If you like the idea, perhaps you would mention it to your friends or, better still, \
copy this e-mail to them.

With kind regards,

Maybe not _just like_ (I don't do windose), but libdl should do.  See
man dlopen (dlsym, dlerror, dlclose).  Or, if you must have LoadLibrary,
get wine and port your code to winelib.

Have a look at dlopen and family, prototyped in /usr/include/dlfcn.h.

Here is an ugly little example for you:

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
int main(){
	int a[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
	int fd;
	fd = open("/usr/local/foo",O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRWXU);
	write(fd, &amp;a, 40);
	close(fd);
	bzero(a,40);
	fd = open("/usr/local/foo", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);
	read(fd, &amp;a, 40);
	close(fd);
	printf("%d\n", a[7]);
	return 0; }

Of course, you should check if each function succeeds, and take evasive
action if it doesn't.  You should read man open, close, man 3 read, and
write to see what they return.  Or maybe you would rather use streams
and formatted IO, it will be more portable from one architecture to
another:  fopen, fprintf, fscanf, fclose...  the possibilities are
endless.

If you don't like to read man pages, try info -f libc and follow the
menus.

This list is an "unmoderated list" which means the owner of the list does
not look after it, so if there is a non working owner who is going to do
what you suggest, we as users cant, all we can do is send a message to
the

wont be a trivial task.
This has also been suggested before, but what can we do;.

Hello friends. I see the list is very quiet at the moment. I am
looking for a way to crosscompile from Linux/i386 to another operating
system we are developing here at V2 Rotterdam (V2_OS, you may have
heard about it). 

I am personally trying to whip up a system to produce executables from
standard Linux tools. I am using Linux GCC, producing .o files, and
then linking them together with ld using a crafted ld script (that
cost me bucketloads of sweat...). And the method is working, with
these two sad exceptions:

1) sometimes I have to lret from a function instead of ret'ing. We
   solved the problem with a medium-rare hack (inserting the lret by
   force after restoring the stack). But the ideal should be to
   declare those subroutines "far" like in old dos days... 
2) Memory access happens always in your data segment. We would really
   love to be making pointer arithmetics with pointers in other
   segments (gs for example - the one that allows you to access to the
   whole memory, base address = 0 and limit = 4G). Here too the ideal
   things would be to declare those pointers "far" and have them
   handled automagically.

I somehow epidermically feel that the only clean way is to do a
complete port of gcc/binutils to the new OS. But that's a huuuge chunk
of work (especially for a person who has very little experience in
this), and we are soooo near to an ideal solution already.

SO it is time to knock at the door of GCC gurus. This is my first
attempt. Maybe a less-linux-specific list is more appropriate, and I'd
like to receive pointers in that directions. Or, maybe, there is an
easy solution to get to our desired goal and you may shed some
light...

Lots of thanks in advance...

I don't think so.  fork returns the pid of the child process to the
parent, and zero to the child, so you are telling the child to return,
and the parent to setsid and execl.  setsid will fail with eperm every
time.  No wonder there are so many broken families nowadays.  BSD
signals are ot the only signals getting crossed here.  Try reversing the
test, so:

    if (pid==0)

and see if that does what you want.

&gt;   {
&gt;     pid=setsid();
&gt;     close(STDOUT_FILENO);
&gt;     close(STDIN_FILENO);
&gt;     close(STDERR_FILENO);

OK, I realize this is pretty simple but...

I have wrote a simple program to keep stats for our local pool league...

Problem is I can't figure out how to save the data to disk  (and get
the same values back).

Could someone please show me how to save, for eg:   int a[10]
to disk, and then retrieve the same values back into "a"?

You have lots of options.  Do you want save straight data without
regard to format, or are you saving formatted data?

&gt; Could someone please show me how to save, for eg:   int a[10]
&gt; to disk, and then retrieve the same values back into "a"?

For example, for formatted output:

*fptr = fopen("somefile", "w");
if(fptr != NULL) {
	fprintf(fptr, "%d", a[10]);
} else {
	fprint(stderr, "%s\n", "write to 'somefile' failed\n");
}

Short version: please provide more information.

hi
Does anybody know:
Is it possible to "export" a C++ class from a library and if how ?
And another thing is that I'm creating a library which
uses functions that I wouldn't like to export. These functions are
members of C++ classes so it isn't possible to make them 'static'.
How can I hide them ?

thank you

Hi gurus,

I have a small prob. I wrote a c++ code that had these lines in this order.

...
...
 number_of_recs = a/2;
 char * recBuf[number_of_recs];
...
...

and the program compiled and ran after compilation with gcc. But my NT
counterpart who is porting my apps couldn't compile it using their compiler
unless he made it a vector instead of an array.

The C++ reference by Stroustrup also prohibits such an assignment. Can someone
please explain why gcc allows it.

TIA

Use -pedantic if you want warnings, or -pedantic-errors if you want it
to refuse to compile such code.  The rest of us might like gcc as it is.
Have a nice read of info -f gcc Invoking GCC -&gt; Warning Options, or at
least man gcc.

1. What is a "newly-unpacked kernel source tree (see below)?"

2. We have just installed Linux. Does that mean we have a source tree
installed or do we have to use the source code from the CD?

&gt;/usr/src/linux/include/asm/ is a symbolic link to an architecture-specific
&gt;asm directory--if you have a freshly unpacked kernel source tree, you must
&gt;make symlinks. You'll also find that you may need to do `make config' in a
&gt;newly-unpacked kernel source tree, to create linux/autoconf.h.

&gt;Then, use rm to remove any garbage, and ln to create the links:

rm -rf /usr/include/linux /usr/include/asm
ln -sf /usr/src/linux/include/linux /usr/include/linux
ln -sf /usr/src/linux/include/asm /usr/include/asm

3. What are we linking to where?

4. How can we then do a "make config?"

Thank you.

Get the kernel source.  Unpack it with

tar -tzf

see man tar.

The kernel folks distribute source as a linux-&lt;V&gt;.&lt;v&gt;.&lt;v&gt;.tar.gz, so
that is how the kernel doco describes it.  If you get it as an rpm,
unpack it with rpm.  It has a man page too.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. We have just installed Linux. Does that mean we have a source tree
&gt; installed or do we have to use the source code from the CD?
&gt; 
If you chose to install the kernel source, you have it.  If you didn't
you can install it from the CD with whatever install tool is appropriate
for what is on the CD.  I don't _know_ what you installed.  *NIX is an
attitude, not a monolith.

&gt; &gt;/usr/src/linux/include/asm/ is a symbolic link to an

&gt; 
&gt; 3. What are we linking to where?

You are linking the names of include directories programs are written to
expect, to the real kernel source files that provide the definitions.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. How can we then do a "make config?"
&gt; 
cd /usr/src/linux
make config
answer the questions.

If you installed some incarnation of RedHat, I hope you installed
glibc-devel.  make config wants to compile some helper programs, and
without glibc-devel, you cannot compile "Hello, world!".  You can check
if you installed it with rpm -q glibc-devel, or see what all you
installed with rpm -qa [|less]

&gt; Thank you.

&gt; 1) sometimes I have to lret from a function instead of ret'ing. We
&gt;    solved the problem with a medium-rare hack (inserting the lret by
&gt;    force after restoring the stack). But the ideal should be to

&gt; 2) Memory access happens always in your data segment. We would really
&gt;    love to be making pointer arithmetics with pointers in other

&gt;    whole memory, base address = 0 and limit = 4G). Here too the ideal
&gt;    things would be to declare those pointers "far" and have them
&gt;    handled automagically.
&gt; 
&gt; I somehow epidermically feel that the only clean way is to do a
&gt; complete port of gcc/binutils to the new OS. But that's a huuuge chunk
&gt; of work (especially for a person who has very little experience in
&gt; this), and we are soooo near to an ideal solution already.

At least part 1) can be done without specific binutils, and minor
modifications to gcc. You could add an attribute to function
declarations, allowing a notation of

int __attribute__((far)) foo(int param)
{
  return -param;
}

To implement that, you'll need to modify gcc/config/i386/i386.c. If
done well, that could become a standard extension, available on all
x86 targets. A quick investigation shows that you'll have to modify
the following pieces (looking at GCC mainline code):

- ix86_valid_type_attribute_p (or ix86_valid_decl_attribute_p?)
- add the instruction to the machine defintion (i386.md), using
  define_insn. If you call it insn, say, "long_return", it will give
  you a function gen_long_return().
- call gen_long_return() inside ix86_expand_epilogue, iff the far
  attribute is set for current_function.

Introducing far pointers is a major undertaking; I recommend an
approach similar to what the Linux kernel did (copy_from_fs,
copy_to_fs, ...). The basic problem is that gcc currently does not
support two different pointer types. You could come up with a new
data-type based on TDImode (see (gcc)Machine Modes), but no port
currently uses that feature.

&gt; SO it is time to knock at the door of GCC gurus. This is my first
&gt; attempt. Maybe a less-linux-specific list is more appropriate, and I'd
&gt; like to receive pointers in that directions. Or, maybe, there is an
&gt; easy solution to get to our desired goal and you may shed some
&gt; light...

The gcc list (gcc@gcc.gnu.org) would be the right place for such a
question.

&gt; Hello all!
&gt; 
&gt; I am in need to run on linux a small app that calls other apps and leaves them
&gt; running in background. What's so special about this ? It is suitable for
&gt; performing this kind of operation from php3 scripts.
&gt; My problem is that this was conceived to work on bsd systems and I have heard
&gt; that bsd signals stuff in linux should be taken into consideration, in order to
&gt; make it work properly on linux. This doesn't perform ok on linux without
&gt; modifications which I am not qualified to perform.
&gt; It compiles ok, but, when I run it, the called app doesn't stay on the
&gt; background.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the code :
&gt; 
&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; int main(int argc, char *argv[])
&gt; {
&gt; int pid;

pid_t pid;

&gt;   pid=fork();
&gt; 
&gt;   if (pid!=0)
&gt;   {
&gt;     pid=setsid();
&gt;     close(STDOUT_FILENO);
&gt;     close(STDIN_FILENO);
&gt;     close(STDERR_FILENO);

I think your logic is at fault.  You want to execl() in the child process,
correct?  fork() returns 0 in the child, so the correct code would be:

if (pid == 0) {
  pid=setsid();
  /*
  * I would check setsid()'s return and declare another variable to
  * store its return value, too.
  */
  close(STDOUT_FILENO);
  close(STDIN_FILENO);
  close(STDERR_FILENO);
  execl(argv[1],argv[2],0);
}

&gt;     execl(argv[1],argv[2],0);
&gt;   }

Um, the argv vector begins at 0.  What happens to that argument?  As
written, the following will fail:

$ ./a.out ls 

and the following will not:

./a.out foobar ls


&gt;
&gt;   return 0;
&gt; }


I would also add a check for fork()'s return, since it may fail:

if((pid = fork()) &lt; 0) {
	/*
	* Handle error here
	*/
} elseif(pid == 0) {
	/*
	* In the child
	*/
} else {
	/*
	* In the parent
	*/
}

you should configure your kernel to build a autoconfig.h file. So do:

cd /usr/src/linux
make config (or make menuconfig if you prefer)

Then try to build your application again.

gcc -shared -fPIC -o lib.so source1.c source2.c ...

You need to compile all objects with -fPIC, and you need to link with
gcc -shared.

Good luck,

&gt; The C++ reference by Stroustrup also prohibits such an

This is a variable-length array, see (gcc)Variable Length in the info

Standard C 99; they are not part of Standard C++ 98.

&gt; How?

You need to install a cross compiler. Configure binutils and gcc for
i386-*-cygwin, and get hold of the cygwin headers and libraries.

Neither OrbixWeb nor Visibroker is free.

If you are looking for "free in the sense of freedom", have a look at

http://adams.patriot.net/~tvalesky/freecorba.html

If you look for C, I personally recommend ILU; ORBit is another choice.

If you look for C++, I recommend MICO or OmniORB; if you are
interested in "free in the sense of no money", then ORBacus is also a
good choice.

If you look for Python, I recommend Fnorb.

For Java, I don't know what to recommend, although there are a number
of options.

Hope this helps,

One of the object modules being linked has been compiled without -fPIC. 
You need to determine which one and fix it.

use: LD_DEBUG=relocs /lib/ld-linux.so.2 &lt;program name&gt;

This will spit out a lot of information on the relocs it is resolving,
including the symbol it fails on.

Hint: try LD_DEBUG=help for more information.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.19 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 1104 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.19 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

under Linux ??

Hung.

In linux-gcc you write:

&gt;I'm using C as the back end for a compiler.  One of the things this
&gt;compiler generates is a jump table consisting of an array of x86 `jmp'
&gt;instructions.  Machine-generated C code calls through this table like
&gt;this:

&gt;  extern const char jump_table[];
&gt;  typedef void (*func_ptr)(void);
&gt;  ....
&gt;  ((func_ptr)&amp;jump_table[256])();

&gt;This works fine unless I both optimize and compile with -fPIC.  When I
&gt;compile that way (with both the call and the jump table are in the
&gt;same file, FWIW), the above code compiles to this:

&gt;   call 256+jump_table@PLT

&gt;That looks plausible, although I don't know what @PLT does.  

jump_table@PLT gets resolved by the linker to point to the Procedure
Linkage Table entry for the 'procedure' jump_table.  I'm not sure exactly
why the compiler got fooled into thinking there is a PLT entry for 
jump_table, as jump_table is not declared as a function ...

As 'jump_table' is really a data symble, you need to look up its absolute 
address in the GOT (Global Offset Table) instead, and use this as a jump
target; with inline assembly something like this should work:

__asm__( "movl jump_table@GOT(%%ebx), %%eax\n"
         "addl $256, %%eax\n"
         "jmp *%%eax\n" );

(This assumes that the %ebx register does indeed contain the GOT address,
as it usually does within gcc generated PIC x86 code ...)

Actually, I'd have assumed that gcc would generate exactly this code
for the code fragment given above, but it appears to get confused.
(Sure, it's undefined behaviour according to the standard, but this
would have been IMHO the logical choice of what to do :-/)
I've experimented using an intermediate variable, like this:

   char *ptr = jump_table + 256;
   ((func_ptr)ptr)();

and *that* does generate exactly the assembly code given above ... 
(gcc-2.7.2.3 with -O2 -fPIC)

Of course, the code you are jumping to needs to be aware as well 
that it might get loaded at different addresses ...  ;-)

&gt;Problem is, that the cross-build of that binutils package (for arm
&gt;development) does overwrite some files.

Which files?  This should be no problem.

&gt;Another solution i can think of, is building a version of binutils that
&gt;supports all targets in libiberty (and others?) and then building packages
&gt;that only add the 'different'  files (e.g. &lt;target&gt;-ld etc..)

Well, that could work.  Configure binutils with --enable-targets=... and just 
install gas and ld separately.  But it shouldn't be necessary.

jaja stits on the stack, not the heap.  

You need to increase the size of your stack space with teh 'ulimit'
command.   It's also possible that the sysadmin set a hard limit 
at 8meg or 24 meg. in which case you need the sysadmins help to raise
it.

You can try using malloc to put it on the heap or try 
'static float jaja[10000]' to put it in the bss.

&gt; &gt; Last time I looked, there was a hard stack limit of 8MB HARDWIRED INTO THE

&gt; 
&gt; Only on old kernels.

Care to name which one ?

There was _never_ a `hardwired' stack limit in the Linux kernel, other
than the GB-or-so limit due to address space considerations on 32bit
systems.  Many distributions shipped with ulimit -s set to 8MB,
however (quite sensibly, IMHO).

I'm using x86 RedHat 6.1, both egcs-2.91.66 and gcc-2.95.2,
and the binutils-2.9.1.0.23-6 RPM.

I'm using C as the back end for a compiler.  One of the things this
compiler generates is a jump table consisting of an array of x86 `jmp'
instructions.  Machine-generated C code calls through this table like
this:

  extern const char jump_table[];
  typedef void (*func_ptr)(void);
  ....
  ((func_ptr)&amp;jump_table[256])();

This works fine unless I both optimize and compile with -fPIC.  When I
compile that way (with both the call and the jump table are in the
same file, FWIW), the above code compiles to this:

   call 256+jump_table@PLT

That looks plausible, although I don't know what @PLT does.  But when
I load this library with dlopen and try to run it, the code crashes.
gdb shows the above call got mis-linked as this:

   call jump_table

In other words, it dropped the 256 byte offset!

Deleting the @PLT from the assembly by hand fixes the problem.

FWIW the code works without optimization because gcc generates
different (slower) code for the call that invokes a different linking
strategy.

I've appended a small test case that shows the bug.  The "normal"
binary it compiles works.  The one it compiles as a shared library
loses the 3 byte jump table offset and therefore calls 0 bytes into
the table, resulting in a call to `bad'.

Any thoughts?  Thanks!

You are confusing the *!&lt; out of PIC by defining an extern char variable
that you then use as a function.  I don't think PIC should even apply to
a relative address, but I don't know how to make it abstain, except by
coding call in asm.  If you substitute

	asm("call jump_table+2")
for
   return ((func_ptr)&amp;jump_table[2])();

it'll work, but of course your real code will want to calculate an
offset into jump_table instead of using a constant offset.  If x86 has
an indexed relative call, I don't remember how to spell it, and I have
moved recently and jettisoned all my old doco.  I don't think it does.
I don't think you really need PIC in a small shared library anyway.
Your sample does work as is if ou just yank -fPIC out of the Makefile.

Wine does use both -fPIC and -O2, but all the jump tables I've noticed
are accessed with hairy asm code that also switches stacks and 16/32 bit
mode.

I can't say for this exact situation but there are optimizations
in gcc 2.95 and possibly before that take the type of the argument into
consideration.  

I know of no garantees in standard C that allow you to assume you can
cast a character pointer into the address of code.

To me the code just looks silly and bad.
If it has a usefulness you might try asking how to do X.
Instead of saying when I rely on non portable code the 
compiler doesn't do what I expect.

I'm not complaining or pointing fingers.  I understand that what I'm
trying to do is not ANSI C, and any C compiler can validly reject this
code.  But gcc provides reasonable behavior for many constructs which
are not strictly conforming, which makes it a good tool for writing
low-level system code, such as kernels and (in my case) the target
language for a compiler.  The meaning of code which casts an arbitrary
address to a function pointer and then calls it is pretty clear, if
not technically allowed by the standard, so it's reasonable to ask if
it can be made to work in the one circumstance where it fails.

 eric&gt; In particular you should write your code more like: typdef void
 eric&gt; (*func_ptr)(void); extern func_ptr jump_table[];
 eric&gt; jump_table[256]();

That approach would also work, and thank you for suggesting it, but it
means something different.  That's a table of function pointers rather
than a sequence of jump instructions.  I want my cross-module calls to
compile to simple call instructions, rather than loading a function
pointer out of some table (which is itself at a PC-relative address)
and then calling that.

 eric&gt; To me the code just looks silly and bad.  If it has a
 eric&gt; usefulness you might try asking how to do X.  Instead of saying
 eric&gt; when I rely on non portable code the compiler doesn't do what I
 eric&gt; expect.

Please don't flame me; I'm a C and compiler expert, I know exactly
what I'm doing.  Using C as the back end for a compiler occasionally
requires low-level hackery to make it generate the desired code.

gcc+as+ld are very close to doing what I want here, so I'm just asking
if they can be tweaked to handle this case.  And even if they can't,
if N+symbol@PLT is always an invalid thing to do then the assembler
should complain rather than silently dropping N.

By the way, I tried to work around this problem by using gcc's `asm
label' extension.  I specified an extern function declaration for my
test jump table entry and gave it the asm label "jump_table+2",
etc. hoping the "@PLT" won't appear in the resulting assembly code.
But it appends @PLT anyway (which is not unreasonable...)

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.21 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 1122 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.21 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

&gt; Is the call graph data actually correct?  That is, are the routines
&gt; which gather that data thread-safe?

No. You'll find the relevant source in glibc 2.1,
gmon/{mcount.c,gmon.c}:_gmonparam, which is a global structure.

&gt; Are profiling timers per-thread?  Is it possible for me to enable it
&gt; in the other threads?  Would that even work?

This is defined in profil.c, of glibc. These days, gcc only emits the
calls to mcount - implementations of this function are often provided
by the platform. In the specific case of Linux, feel free to ask the
glibc maintainers for their thoughts.

I'd say it is inherently difficult to activate global profiling. What
*might* work is per-thread profiling, and then writing back the
profile data. In any case, the overhead of profiling becomes even more
visible due to the multithreading calls, on each mcount invocation
(which tend to be system calls).

Martin

Hi,

I want to use both native binutils and cross binutils on one computer.
I use Red Hat 6.1 with binutils-2.9.1.0.23

Problem is, that the cross-build of that binutils package (for arm
development) does overwrite some files.
What I want to have is a way to build "plug-in" packages that can add
cross-dev support packages one at a time, so a solution of supporting 2
fixed targets is not the way I want.

I've seen a solution of moving all duplicate files to another directory and
using a wrapper script for the cross-tools to let them find the proper
files. Is this a good idea? At least you can cleanly add 1 or more targets

Another solution i can think of, is building a version of binutils that
supports all targets in libiberty (and others?) and then building packages
that only add the 'different'  files (e.g. &lt;target&gt;-ld etc..)

What's your opinion about this?

Profiling uses the profil(2/3) utility here. It is not a system call
on Linux, so behaviour with regard to system calls might be surprising
(actually, it is a system call, but that does not work).  Instead, it
is a C library function implemented with standard system calls (see
glibc sources for details).

If you think this should change, please report that to the Linux
and/or glibc maintainers.

Martin

gcc allocates automatic variables on the stack.  Your system
administrator may have limited the stack size to some value [s]he
considers reasonable.  You can check with ulimit -s if that is the means
[s]he has used to do so.  This is not the limit to the size of one nor
all automatic variables:  the stack is also used for other purposes.

If you make a variable static or extern, it will go in the data segment,
which is subject to a different (usually higher) limit (ulimit -d), and
yor program might work.  It still won't _do_ anything, however.  Or you
could use malloc, shmget, mmap, ... to allocate space for it
dynamically.

There is at least one limit to everything.  The ix86 can't address more
than 4gb in any one address space, so it will not have an easy time
working with 1g float values in one variable.  Other more stringent
limits may be imposed.  Void where proibited.

There is no such thing as a free lunch.

Yes.
 
&gt; You need to increase the size of your stack space with teh 'ulimit'
&gt; command.   It's also possible that the sysadmin set a hard limit 
&gt; at 8meg or 24 meg. in which case you need the sysadmins help to raise
&gt; it.

Last time I looked, there was a hard stack limit of 8MB HARDWIRED INTO THE
KERNEL SOURCE.

Now, in my own long-running scientific computations, I use the stack as
much as possible to avoid heap fragmentation when the program is about to
run a month or so allocating and deallocating many temporary vars of
varying types.
Normally my code is not deeply recursively nested though.

As I suspect there are in addition many people with deeply recursive code
too, I always found the 8MB limit quite ridiculous.

As I don't do my computations on linux, I was not yet forced much to raise
the stack limit, so my question(s) [I found no comments about these in the
source]: 

Is there any good reason for the 8MB limit? Is it configurable somehow
(in more decent versions, when I looked it even was no #define as far as I
remember) ? Or is this just laziness and noone ever cared to raise the
(hardwired) limit?

AFAIK there was also code missing to lower the preset 8MB stack limit even
more. (might become important if max stacksize becomes something sensible
like 2GB)

I did this test on a Red Hat 6.1 system (glibc 2.1.2) with kernel
2.2.13.

I compiled the appended program like so:

   gcc -O2 -Wall -g -pg -o foo foo.c

*** Note the -pg option; it is the whole point of the exercise ***

I ran it, and found that the profiling timer is not being delivered
while the program is in select().  In fact, I have not been able to
find a single system call during which the profiling signal is
delivered.  (I do admit, so far I have only tried select(), sleep(),
and pthread_join().)

Is this behavior expected?  I would have thought that time spent in
system calls would be pretty important when profiling an application.

Yes there is.  When "-pg" is passed to the linker it causes it to link
against gcrt0.o instead of crt0.o.  The former invokes "monstartup"
which starts the profiling timer.

If you don't believe me, try compiling the program exactly as I said
to do and then running it.  You will observe that the SIGPROF handler
is invoked, just not during the select().

It turns out that this behavior is documented in the gprof info pages.
(I apologize for sending my message before completely researching the
issue.)  This turns out to be inconvenient for me: I was trying to
make gprof work on a multithreaded program by intercepting SIGPROF in
the main thread and forwarding it to the child threads.  But in my
multithreaded program, the main thread is frequently blocked in a
system call, so I never get the interrupts to forward.  I hacked
around this by calling setitimer() in the child threads to enable the
profiling timer by hand.  (Yes, I understand how information can be
lost both with mcount() and with the profiling timer in the presence
of multiple threads.  But any information is better than none, which
is what you get from gprof right now for everything but the main
thread.)

 andrea&gt; Only userspace calls mcount() so only userspace will be
 andrea&gt; profiled.

mcount() generates the call graph; I am talking about the statistical
sampling provided by the profiling timer.  I understand why system
calls are not sampled, but I am not sure I like it.  High-latency
system calls can have a big effect on an application's performance.
If your application is slow because it makes too many slow system
calls, there does not seem to be any easy way to find that out; the
results of gprof can even be misleading.

gprof is not for profiling the kernel.  Only user time is counted.

About system call latency ... anyone tried the Linux Trace Toolkit?

This will give you exactly how much time is spent in any system
call and what the kernel does during that system call. Total system
overhead is below 1.5% for non-fs intensive systems. This effectively
closes the gprof loop-hoole and reports micro-second accurate system
call / trap / irq information and much more ... Take a look for yourself

LTT's home page:

http://www.info.polymtl.ca/~karym/trace

&gt; calls are not sampled, but I am not sure I like it.  High-latency
&gt; system calls can have a big effect on an application's performance.
&gt; If your application is slow because it makes too many slow system
&gt; calls, there does not seem to be any easy way to find that out; the

OOPS!  A library is not necessarily a normal c program; it is quite
normal for a library not to have a main(), and as you would not normally
run a library as a command, it should have no need to define _start and
no need for crt1.o.  I think something has tampered with your Makefile.
Normally, I think you would make a library by giving gcc (or ld) the  
option

  -shared

which would make appropriate adjustments for other parameters.

You might also want -Wl,-soname,blah.so if you want executables to be
able to reference it by soname.

Often, packages are set up to make a new makefile by running ./configure
if anything in the target system has changed (or when they first meet
the target system), or maybe even autoconf to make a new ./configure
first.  Better look back to the README or INSTALL :-)

Sorry, I didn't know php was a library, or I might have saved us a lot
of trouble.

Well, the command this happens on is when it's throwing all the binaries
together to make a library.  Hm.  grep -r "main(" * did not reveal any
binaries with it in.  That does make sense seeing it's a library...  :)  
I don't know when it happened.  One day I tried to make a new version of
php, and it didn't work.  I went back to compile an old version, still
didn't work.

   Hello,
  can somebody tell me where to find a tutorial about shared memory ?
  i want to write a program that reads many data from disk and keeps it
  in not swapped memory, after when this program receives a signal it
  forks an application that should read an input file and compute something
  using the data from the shared memory,,...
    if you can send me an example or sugesstion about how to do it
  i would thank you a lot,

     best cheers,
                    Rafa

   Hello,

  thank you very much for your answers,
  i read the linux programmers guide and it helped me a lot,

   i did a first successfull test :-)  but i got errors when i tried
 to use a bigger size for the shared memory (greater than around 3000000),
 what is the origin of the problem ?? is there any limit for the size of
 the shared memory ? is possible to change it ?

   regards,
                 Rafa

Doesn't matter how ridiculously big you set any limit, sooner or later
some pig of a program will bump up against it.  Why would you think
there wouldn't be limits?

Why not use perror() to print the error message after the function call
that fails, so you would get a clue?

If you are using shared memory as managed by shmget, shmat, shmctl, and
friends, the limits to that are described in

/usr/[local]/include/asm/shmparam.h, aka
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/shmparam.h

You can change those limits and recompile the kernel, but don't blame me
if you make a kernel that won't boot.

As you will see if you think about it, you cannot share more memory than
there is, either.  As a general rule, you will not be able to stand how
slow it runs if you use 3 or more times as much virtual memory as there
is real memory.

It's been rumoured that Dr. Michael Weller said:

#        - core - limits the core file size (KB)

    Hello, i found that the following program gives an error, why ?
 is there any limit in the size of variables ?

      main () {
      int i;
      float jajaja[1000000][300];
      i=1;
      sleep(1);
      }

  i tried it compiling with gcc on as linux pc and a digital unix4 machines,
 and it only worked using the cc dec compiler,

Just why are you are causing a code fork between your version of gdb and
GNU's 4.18 version of gdb?

I assume you are using xlc to compile gcc.
You need to

you run configure

hello there:

I have a question for you. I dont know is it te rigth place but anyway.
I have installed RedHat Linux 6.0 and glibc 2.1.
The problem is that i have too Interbase 4.0 for linux. The libraries for 
interbase were linked against glibc2.0 from REdHat 5.1.
I have installed the compat-* rpm from the installation. How can I link my programs \
to the interbase that uses glibc2.0.  and how can i tell to the loader to use  \
glibc2.1 or glibc2.0 at the same time depending on the library the current program \
need.  Thans in advance
                                                            Ernesto

&gt; This is a great idea, thanks very much!

Yeah, well, it was a demangling bug in 4.18
(http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4835) which
pushed me over the edge.  gdb-4.18-5 should be a big step forward for
C++ debugging (as far as I know), but I'm still looking for people to
find and report bugs.  In particular, I'm aware of cases in which
spurious SIGTRAP's happen and pretty much make debugging impossible
(thread-related, I would guess, but I don't really know, I might know
how to reproduce some of these but I'm not sure).

There is now a gdb-4.18-6.*.rpm on http://people.redhat.com/kingdon/ -
the only difference from -5 is fixing a small but annoying problem
with the info files.

&gt; Presumably you mean the mailing lists referenced on the .../gdb/ page.

If people can't figure that out, do we really want bug reports from
them? :-)

Seriously, yeah, it would have been good to be a bit more explicit.

You must change the way the function "accept" is called in line 136 of
the file tcp_server.c. The parameter should be an address of a
variable of type "socklen_t", not an address of a variable of type
"int".

Hope this helps,

You can use f2c to translate the fortran into c;

g77 is implemented as extensions to gcc, so it can handle both fortran
and c if it's properly built and installed;

I have a little script named usr/bin/f77 I guess must have been from
slackware 3.4 that will take .f and .c files through f2c and gcc to
produce an executable.

See if you have /usr/info/g77.info, if not it is part of g77.  if you
have it, info -f g77 will tell you almost everything you could want to
know.

   Date: Tue, 12 Oct 1999 00:41:35 +0200
   From: "Martin v. Loewis" &lt;martin@mira.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de&gt;

   &gt; The symbol _xstat is an internal symbol for private use by glibc.  You
   &gt; shouldn't have used that symbol in your program.  Use stat instead,
   &gt; and recompile the offending program.  And please use the glibc-bug
   &gt; script to report problems with glibc.  This mailing list isn't
   &gt; reguarly read by glibc developers.

   Although I lost the original message, I think I remember the concern
   was with some application that the user had no source to, and so was
   uncapable of recompiling. In that context, I have to questions:

   - How did it come about that the application uses _xstat? That
     function is not documented, and I can't see why anybody
     intentionally invokes that in application code. Saying "you should
     not have used it" seems like the wrong response, since it seems that
     it was not actively used.  

     I still can't understand how the symbol got into the exectuble, but
     I have a theory: Some (static) library was compiled for libc5, and
     the C source used stat. As a result, this expanded to _xstat in the
     object code of the library. The library continues to work with glibc
     2, so the application developer continues to use it. While this is
     still a mistake on part of whoever provided the library, this is not
     as bad as "you fool shouldn't have used _xstat in the first
     place". Please comment.

Another possibility is that the libc5 header was used instead of the
glibc one, because glibc was incorrectly installed.  This has actually
happened before (but quite a long time ago).

   - Now that the symbol is used, is there a mechanism to run
     applications relying on it? I would think that a proper LD_PRELOAD
     object could help, delegating from _xstat to __xstat. If such a
     library is provided, it would help people using glibc. People could
     then wrap the applications with a shell script setting LD_PRELOAD.

Should be possible but I don't think any of the glibc developers is
going to spend time on implementing it.

In retrospect my message was a bit harsh.  Guess that's what happens
if you see too many messages from people complaining about glibc who
are not reading the documentation and do not make very much effort in
filing bug reports :-(.

This release, for Linux, includes:

* a fix regarding backtraces through signal handlers
* many C++ fixes (compared with GDB 4.18)

probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.  For those who have been
following GDB development, this is nothing new, it is the 19991004
snapshot, very lightly patched.  But it my hope that putting it into
an RPM package will lead to more people testing it.

Get x86 and source RPM packages at http://people.redhat.com/kingdon/

Report bugs at http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla/ (you can put in

hello there:

I have a question for you. I dont know is it te rigth place but anyway.
I have installed RedHat Linux 6.0 and glibc 2.1.
The problem is that i have too Interbase 4.0 for linux. The libraries for 
interbase were linked against glibc2.0 from REdHat 5.1.
I have installed the compat-* rpm from the installation. How can I link my programs \
to the interbase that uses glibc2.0.  and how can i tell to the loader to use  \
glibc2.1 or glibc2.0 at the same time depending on the library the current program \
need.  Thans in advance

List,

Does anyone out there have any experience or knowledge of writing programmes
that access an Oracle database that is hosted on a SunOS 5.5 Host from
Linux?

I would be most interested to hear of any products or sample C code that
will enable me to start writing my own programme in this vein.

I have to date not found anything overly useful from the Oracle web site,
but then I could have missed it...  Is there anything in the Public Domain
that may be useful? Are there any Commercial Packages available? I did
briefly look at the MyODBC and MySQL products, but couldn't immediately see
how to use them for my purposes. Did I miss something?

Any and all help will be most gratefully received.

Thanks,

Hi,

I know that Oracle provides a special pre-compiler
that allows you to use special Oracle routines in
your C-code, which you then pre-compile with this 
compiler and this result can then be feeded to your
regular C-compiler. 
I've never used it (I use Perl to do these things)
but I think it comes with the standard Oracle Enterprise
version.

Yes, I've done something very similar (remote oracle DB on NT).

I think the best way to get startet would be by downloading the oracle
workgroup server for linux; this contains the needed oracle sqlnet client
libraries and sample code for OCI (Oracle Call Interface) applications (in
$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/demo). 

For your programs you can either use the OCI interface (fairly lowlevel,
very powerfull, fast) or you could use pro*c, a c- language preprocessor
which converts embedded sql commands to OCI syntax. Easier to use but not
quite as efficient as doing OCI yourself, used to requiere a seperate
license (not sure about current status).

You'll probably want to look at the OCI and Pro*C Documentation, wich are
available at http://technet.oracle.com/docs/products/oracle8/doc_index.htm
(needs a free technet registration).

Bye, Martin

Perhaps you could have posted the commands you have been executing, in
order, so that others can see what you've been doing wrong.

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "get the system using it". The
"system" is not using gcc on its own; it is always the user who is
invoking gcc.

Anyway, the following sequence should do

tar xzvf gcc-...
cd gcc-2.95
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --enable-threads
make bootstrap
make install

Hope this helps,
Martin

Does nobody else read this list?  I don't have anything as recent as
gcc-2.95.1, but gcc-2.7.2.3 will look to /usr/local/include first unless
you have configured it to look elsewhere for LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR.  Unless
you are running it as a cross-compiler, of course.  It expects you to
put in /usr/local/include headers you want to override the standard
headers.  I doubt they've changed that, but I'd be interested to know.

It is usually compiled into cpp when gcc is built:

~ $ strings /lib/cpp|grep /include
/usr/include
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/include
/usr/i386-redhat-linux/include
/usr/local/include
/usr/include/g++-2
/include
~ $ 

If you do not want to rebuild gcc you can add it to the specs file
(/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs on my system)

I have not tried this (since I do not need to) but I would add the
-I/usr/local/include near the beginning of the *cpp: section.

Hope this helps.

No /include in my gcc after this procedure :-o

I have this:

So, after %(cpp_cpu)?

Yes, the following simple (C++) test program doesn't work under
glibc-2.1 if compiled/linked with glibc-2.0 (tested with RedHat 5.2

&gt; Yes, the following simple (C++) test program doesn't work under
&gt; glibc-2.1 if compiled/linked with glibc-2.0 (tested with RedHat 5.2
&gt; vs. RedHat 6.0)
&gt; ---------------------------- snip --------------------------
&gt; #include &lt;strstream.h&gt;
&gt; main() {
&gt;    char x ;
&gt;    istrstream beitl (&amp;x, 1) ;
&gt;    char y ;
&gt;    beitl.read (&amp;y, 1) ;
&gt; }

I can confirm that after the installation of glibc-2.1.2 on my Debian system
program using C++ iostream always crashes.
It's not a good behaviour coz the libraries has the same main version number
( 2.* and .6 for .so ) and must be binary compatible !

Cheers,
    Davide.

you'll need to recompile the shared libstdc++.

they are using library internals like the __setfpucw function or

2.27 says (at least my version):
{AJ,CG} If you just upgrade the glibc from 2.0.x (x &lt;= 7) to 2.1,
binaries that have been linked against glibc 2.0 will continue to
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.21.   What do I need for C++ development?
[...]
 
{UD} But since in the case of a shared libstdc++ the version numbers should
be different existing programs will continue to work.

Note: I don't have problems with LFS and I did install the "old"
libstdc++ (2.8.0) on the new RedHat (glibc-2.1.1) box, but the simple
(strstreams) test program gets a SEGV...

Hi all,

&gt;    I can confirm that after the installation of glibc-2.1.2 on my Debian
system
&gt;    program using C++ iostream always crashes.

now I'm at work and ( sigh ! ) I don't have a Linux system.
This evening I'll post all the information about crashes ( ldd output, gdb
backtrace and disassemble near crashpoint ).
Anyway I've already posted this info at bug-glibc@gnu.org and
debian-glibc@lists.debian.org .

Cheers,
    Davide.

&gt; The symbol _xstat is an internal symbol for private use by glibc.  You
&gt; shouldn't have used that symbol in your program.  Use stat instead,
&gt; and recompile the offending program.  And please use the glibc-bug
&gt; script to report problems with glibc.  This mailing list isn't
&gt; reguarly read by glibc developers.

Although I lost the original message, I think I remember the concern
was with some application that the user had no source to, and so was
uncapable of recompiling. In that context, I have to questions:

- How did it come about that the application uses _xstat? That
  function is not documented, and I can't see why anybody
  intentionally invokes that in application code. Saying "you should
  not have used it" seems like the wrong response, since it seems that
  it was not actively used.  

  I still can't understand how the symbol got into the exectuble, but
  I have a theory: Some (static) library was compiled for libc5, and
  the C source used stat. As a result, this expanded to _xstat in the
  object code of the library. The library continues to work with glibc
  2, so the application developer continues to use it. While this is
  still a mistake on part of whoever provided the library, this is not
  as bad as "you fool shouldn't have used _xstat in the first
  place". Please comment.

- Now that the symbol is used, is there a mechanism to run
  applications relying on it? I would think that a proper LD_PRELOAD
  object could help, delegating from _xstat to __xstat. If such a
  library is provided, it would help people using glibc. People could
  then wrap the applications with a shell script setting LD_PRELOAD.

Martin

   This release, for Linux, includes:

   * threads
   * floating point fixes
   * a fix regarding backtraces through signal handlers
   * many C++ fixes (compared with GDB 4.18)

   probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.  For those who have been
   following GDB development, this is nothing new, it is the 19991004
   snapshot, very lightly patched.  But it my hope that putting it into
   an RPM package will lead to more people testing it.

This is a great idea, thanks very much!

   Get x86 and source RPM packages at http://people.redhat.com/kingdon/

   Report bugs at http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla/ (you can put in
   "rawhide" for the release as this package will be in the next weekly
   rawhide release) and/or http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/ (take your
   pick).

Presumably you mean the mailing lists referenced on the .../gdb/ page.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.16 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 1012 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.16 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

Note that this may not work on all distributions: for example, if your
distro has the gcc executable in /usr/bin and /usr/bin is in the path before
/usr/local/bin (which should be where gcc installs by default), then you
may end up running the old one.

Really the best thing to do is get an updated package (rpm, deb, whatever)
from your vendor.

This compiler is called Pro-C. It allows you to embed SQL like
commands within a C program.  I have used it for some simple
inserts and selects on a Unixware platform years ago.  It worked
very well.  Please post to the list if you resolve whether Oracle
has ported this to Linux.

&gt; I know that Oracle provides a special pre-compiler

&gt; I've never used it (I use Perl to do these things)

&gt; I must use linker script of ld to control the output file
&gt; format. There are example files of linker script, and I want to
&gt; choose one to modify. There are example files named ELF-i386.x and
&gt; ELF-i386.xr, and so on. Which linker script is used as default in
&gt; Redhat linux 6.0 on i386?

It depends on what you want to link: a relocatable object, a shared
object, or an executable. To see which one is used in a specific
linker invocation, use the ld --verbose option.

Hope this helps,
Martin

&gt; So, after %(cpp_cpu)?

That will work (I tried it using a dummy include directory).  

One thing may have to watch out for is the order that directories are
searched --- people are rather unimaginative when they name things and
you can often find include files with the same name (X is a real bad
offender at this, and I swear it includes files it did not intend to.)
The -I directive will put /usr/local/include at the beginning of the
search path, and since it is the first -I it will be searched before
any directories the makefiles try to insert using their own -I
commands.  If this turns out to be a problem, you will need to get
fancier -- see info gcc and the node "Preprocessor Options" and info
cpp for the gory details.  You might just be safer rebuilding gcc
using the (Linux) "standard" include path order if you have a lot of
programs that use /usr/local/include and require the normal search
pattern.  (Assuming /usr/local/include is in ones include search path
is probably heresy to someone somewhere :-)

The search path according to redhat-6.0 appears to be:

[snip]
~ $ su -l
~ # mkdir /usr/local/include
~ # exit
exit
~ $ strace -o duh /lib/cpp
#include &lt;duh.h&gt;
&gt; 1: duh.h: No such file or directory
# 1 ""

~ $ grep 'open.*/duh\.h' duh
open("/usr/local/include/duh.h", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file
or directory)
open("/usr/i386-redhat-linux/include/duh.h", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No
such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/include/duh.h",

This is with stock RedHat 6.1 (package glibc-2.1.2-11).

I have a multithreaded Linux application which I want to profile with
gprof.  As near as I can tell, the call graph is correct but the
timing information is taken from the main thread only.  I assume this
is primarily because the profiling timer signal is only being
delivered to the main thread.

Questions:

Is the call graph data actually correct?  That is, are the routines
which gather that data thread-safe?

Are profiling timers per-thread?  Is it possible for me to enable it
in the other threads?  Would that even work?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.11 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0906 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.11 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

I had exactly this problem after upgrading glibc from 2.0 to 2.1, but
I don't remember the solution. :-(

After upgrading glibc from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 and
binutils from 2.9.5.0.8 to 2.9.5.11, gcc 2.95.1 reports itself as C++
crosscompiler, but not C crosscompiler. I must recompile gcc also
after a glibc upgrade?

Just found; when I define configure --host=i486-pc-linux-gnu, C++ don't
reports itself as crosscompiler. So, I'm interesting, that this is belongs
to glibc or binutils?

Gabor&gt; My real question is the reverse of this problem.

Gabor&gt; What is, when I compile a libc for better processor, like compiling
Gabor&gt; for i686 on an i486? I miss something, or not, when I use the new libc
Gabor&gt; on the i686?

If you compile for an i686 it will only run on i686 (or newer) but not
on i386,i486,i586.

If you compile for i486, it will run on i486, i586, i686 - but not on
i386.

Gabor&gt; I want compile a libc that usable on every i4-686 processor, and also
Gabor&gt; gcc, binutils. I must do this for every type of processor, or I can do
Gabor&gt; it on a 486, without any feature missing?

Just compile for i486.  You don't miss a feature - just maybe a tiny
bit of speed (but you should test yourself if you can measure this at
all).

Hi,

I'm using a linux-i386 -&gt; linux-m68k crosscompiler setup and found a
problem with binutils-2.9.5.0.7. The following example should show
the problem:

        .global abc,def

start:
        bras    abc
        .rept   64
        nop
        .endr
abc:
        nop

        bras    def
        nop
def:
        nop


The assembler doesn't complain about the first illegal jump, but about the
second legal one. If I remove the .global line it works.
There is a second (maybe related) problem. The assemble doesn't optimize
anymore short jumps to global labels. The following source produces two
different jump instructions:

	.global	abc
	jra	abc
	nop
abc:	jra	def
	nop
def:

Both problems are not binutils 2.9.1.

b1 is not a pointer, and referencing to it's internal object u is

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.13 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0922 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.13 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:

Hi,
I've tried to install glibc from sources time ago and it fails.
Someone told me that it wasn't possible to do that without previously patch
the sources
with Debian patch.
I've not seen the patch but so I can't say enough about it.
It was 8 months ago, and I don't know if now it's possible.
I agree with the fact that it must be possible to install for sources,
anyway I continue
to like Debian.

Cheers,
    Davide.

Well, I would come to the hardware conclusion too if it were not for two
things:

1)  I can compile the kernel (2.2.12) all day long with no problems.

2)  I had a working system and compiled gcc-2.95.1 with egcs-1.1.2 and
glibc-2.1.2 with the the resulting gcc ( I only had a problem when I
botched the install of the resulting library and ended up --long story--
re-installing the base debian 2.1 system etc... etc...).
 
3)  I had the same problem on another machine running slackware 3.0 that I
upgraded by hand to glibc-2.0.7.  There was some kind of funny interaction
between the supplied gcc-2.7.2.3 and gcc-2.8.1 that I was trying to build.
I ended up downgrading to gcc-2.7.2.1 and then gcc-2.8.1 would build.
Then, I could build egcs-1.1.2 and then glibc-2.0.7. I still don't know
why gcc-2.7.2.1 would build gcc-2.8.1, but 2.7.2.3 would not.
 
If nobody has any insight for me, I guess I will have to go through this
time consuming, "step up through compiler versions" process again.
 
I also am wondering why configure can't seem to determine the right minor
number for the installed glibc.
 
Sorry to bother you folks with this, but it's frustrating to say the least
:)

I can't seem to figure out why a certain C program won't compile under linux with this Makefile. It compiles fine under Unix (Sun). Do I need to change this Makefile in any way for it to work under Linux (RH5.2)? I tried removing the colons from ":=", but to no avail. Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

Thanks,
Mark

[please CC: to lsetia@hss.hns.com as i'm not a member - thanks]

Hi,

I want to know how an executable loads up, what all is initialized before
the control is passed onto main() function, and all this stuff. In
particular:

1. What's the role of crt0.o crtn.o etc. ??
2. How are the arguments and environment variables passed?
3. What all initializations/static variables are made by glibc, and how do
   I control these?

I don't need an exact binary specification of these things, just the
concept, with some detail.

Any pointers will be helpful (and please cc: a reply!).


With warm regards,
Lokesh Setia.

{
	int x;
	void *y;
};

struct b
{
	char *u;
	int v;
	float z;
};

and in my code I write as

main()
{
	struct a a1;
	struct b b1;
	.
	.
	b1.u = "hello";
	b1.v = 10;
	b1.z = 20.1;
	.
	.
	a1.y = (struct b *)
	. 
	.
	fun(&amp;a1);
	.
	.
}

fun(struct a *x1)
{
	struct b y1;
	.
	.
	y1 = (struct b *)x1;
	printf("%s\n",y1.u);
	.
	.
}

what I want to know is that is it possible to access the struct b
component in struct a without using the temperory variable y1?

Thanks and regards,

Is there A HOWTO or web site that discusses upgrading one version of glibc
to another ? The only ones I can find deal with moving from libc5 to libc6
which I have already done successfully.
 
I am currently running glibc-2.0.7pre6 on debian 2.1.  I obtained the
sources to glibc-2.1.2, compiled ok with gcc-2.95.1, I then did make
install to /lib and /usr/lib.
 
At that point, I thought the proper thing to do was to move the symlinks
from the old libraries to the new ones (and the ld-linux.so.2 link to the
new loader).
 
Kaboom!
 
None of my existing binaries work.  They all complain of the same
undefined symbol (It escapes me at the moment, but I will re-create it and
get the exact name if I didn't go about this the wrong way).

Is 2.0.7 binary compatible with 2.1.2 ?

After apparently screwing up an upgrade to glibc-2.1.2, I decided to
completely wipe my system and start "fresh" (This is my "play" machine, so
that's ok).
 
On a fresh debian 2.1 ftp install (basic development environment), I have:
gcc-2.7.2.3
egcs-1.1.1
binutils 2.9.1.0.19
glibc-2.0.7

a newly installed 2.2.12 kernel and source.
 
When I run configure for gcc-2.95.1, it insists on building the compiler
for a i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1 system.  However, /usr/include/features.h
clearly has __GLIBC__ 2 and minor of 0.  When I try to force it with

configure --prefix=/usr --host=i586-pc-linux-gnu , it says that it can't
find the glibc minor number.
 
Also, if I try to continue as gnulibc1, the build quits after about five
minutes with an 'internal compiler error, fatal signal 11'.
 
Incidentally, I can't build egcs-1.1.2 either, same problem.
 
I see in the faq that comes with the source, there is a reference to
Signal 11 on Linux, but there is no entry for it.  Only a reference to a
file on a server someplace that I can't seem to get to.  I think it is out
of date.

Your problem is either not enough virtual memory, or (more likely) bad
hardware. Look at http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/ for more details.

Overclocking and/or overheating can also cause this... forget running

Hi Tim,

You _must_ use Debian packages for glibc or patch original sources with the
patch supplied by Debian.

Programs (not all libraries) which don't use the internal symbols of
glibc and were compiled against glibc 2.0.7, should work with 2.1.2.
You might need to recompile some libraries as documented in the FAQ.

Would it be something along the lines of "__register_frame_info"? If so,
the problem is related to the c compiler. If you compile glibc with egcs
1.1.2, that problem will probably go away. OTOH, if you ask nicely on the
gcc@gcc.gnu.org you may be able to get a patch for this. IIRC, it's not a
bug, it's a feature.

&gt; Is 2.0.7 binary compatible with 2.1.2 ?
The answer is yes and no. AFAICT most problems are to do with developers
using internal glibc symbols[1]. You might find it worthwhile to use the
glibc-compat addon, though.

[1] I'm a little hazy on this, but WTH.

I agree that a Debian package is better integrated in a Debian system
- but using the released glibc 2.1.2 for a Debian system should work.
Otherwise the Debian developers have done IMO something totally wrong.

I absolutely agree with Andreas here -- could you explain _why_ a
special Debian patch for glibc is critically necessary ?  And why
wasn't it posted/discussed on the glibc mailing lists ?

I really like Debian but my home machine is completely
distribution-neutral (everything compiled from source) and I _need_ to
be able to compile packages on that machine and then count on the fact
that they run on a recent Debian release...  Until now, this worked
reasonably OK.

Wolfram.

malloc and family are your friends.

During compilation no errors are reported but as soon as I run the

Hi,
I have to save/restore the heap space in my program. 
The problem is, in linux, at which exact address the heap starts. Does heap start \
from a fixed address in linux?  I have tried sbrk(0) at the very beginning of the \
progrom, but I find the returned value seems not the starting of heap space.

Thanks

Hi all!

I try to write device driver that support several ISA-adapters and the same
high-level protocol.
All of that HW stuff have to perform a same operations.
In WinNT I've solve this problem by using the base class with virtual
functions that are implement that operations.

The attempt to apply this approach in Linux loadable module leads to errors
when loading it.
The message that "__rtti_user and __rtti_si " not found appears.

g++ RTTI cannt be disabled by command line keys (may be I am wrong, at least
I cant find in man) like it can be made in BC++, VC++, Watcom C++.

The questions are "Can the Linux kernel mode loadable modules execute code
that uses classes with virtual functions?"
or "How can I disable RTTI?"

PS.
My questions is beyond of discussion of C++ usage in kernel mode drivers
:-).

Andrey.

If you can recompile/relink your software with glibc, that might be
better in the long run, but yes, glibc and libc5 can coexist.  You don't
want to mix them in the same run unit, but ld.so will try to see that
you don't.  Normally, an install for a libc/glibc will set it as the
primary program development library for your system, so it's easiest to
install the one you want for this last.  there is a Glibc howto that
describes at least one setup to be able to compile programs with either
libc.

You can use ldd to tell you which libc a program uses.  To find which
one is being used for program development, I would write a "Hello,
world" program, link it and use ldd on it. :-)

Generally not.  If you don't have the source it is difficult, but if you
do it is usually just a matter of changing #include &lt;linux/blah.h&gt; to
#include &lt;sys/blah.h&gt; if it won't compile as is. Oops, blah.h is
American English for &lt;whatever&gt;.h :-).  If a program uses libc5
internals, of course that could be a problem, but most don't.  There is
at least one function that is defined in libc.so.5 that glibc defines in
libc.a as a wrapper for an internal glibc function, but that normally
doesn't do any harm.  Alas, I have forgotten what and why it is, but if
you have trouble with it I'll likely recognize it and find the doco
again.

Hi,

Are there known bugs in GCC related to multiple instantiations of a linked
list in C++ code?

I have a short C++ program in which I instantiate a linked list (defined as
a class).  It always compiles without incident.  When I edit the code to
instantiate one (small, simple) linked list, the program runs fine; when I
edit the code to instantiate two such objects, the program still runs fine.
However, when the code instantiates three or more more such objects, it seg
faults and core dumps at the first attempt to access any of these objects.
I've traced the problem as far as I can and it's clear that memory addresses
are conflicting between the objects.  Again, two objects work fine.

I've seen this problem in both a 2.7.x version and a 2.9.x version of the
compiler.  My code compiled and ran fine on an HP-UX which I no longer have
access to.  I'd be happy to forward the code, but I'm not sure if this email
address is valid anymore; I found it in the GCC-HOWTO (1996) in the LDP.

Please advise!  Thank you,

Casey

gcc's C++ compiler is known to be less thann optimal, to be sure.  Have you
tried egcs? See http://egcs.cygnus.com.  As to your particular problem, post
the smallest code that compiles and illustrates the problem so others can
reproduce it.

Hi,

I've uploaded the second and maybe last test release for glibc 2.1.2 to

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
and
	ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

(where XX is your country code).  You can find at these sites the files

	glibc-2.1.2pre2.tar.bz2
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.2pre2.tar.bz2

and appropriate .gz versions.  There is no new crypt add-on, the one
from glibc 2.1 is still current.

This is just a bug fix release.  No new features.  All reported and
fixable problems should be handled.

Please give it a try and send feedback to the
libc-alpha@sourceware.cygnus.com list.

&gt; 
&gt; Ian and H.J.,
&gt; 
&gt;   here is another problem I ran into - it seems not to be gcc related
&gt; as static linking does not trigger the bug.
&gt; 

It works fine for me with binutils 2.9.5.0.5 on Solaris 7/Sparc.


H.J.
----
This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.5 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0806 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.5 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

&gt; I have to save/restore the heap space in my program.  The problem
&gt; is, in linux, at which exact address the heap starts. Does heap
&gt; start from a fixed address in linux?

No.The loads all segments of the executable image, and sets the brk
right after it. So it depends on the size of the executable where the
heap starts.

  Hi, all. I've just tried compiling some code on a RedHat 6.0 system,
and ran across a problem. I've written some test code that
demonstrates the problem:

% cat egcs-example.c
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int func (char *array)
{
    return tolower (array[0]);
}
% cc -c -Wall -pedantic-errors -O2 egcs-example.c
egcs-example.c: In function `func':
egcs-example.c:5: ANSI C forbids braced-groups within expressions
% gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

Anyone familiar with this problem?

I get the following error from a program.

setup.o: In function `setup':
setup.o(.text+0xad6): undefined reference to `bsd_ioctl'
setup.o(.text+0xcc6): undefined reference to `bsd_ioctl'

I'm not sure what it means but I suspect that it got something to do 
with the 'iocl.h' header file. I made sure that the
 #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;
is in the source code. The reference 'bsd_ioctl' is used nowhere in 
the program, only the function ioctl() is called within the code.

Can someone please help me out with this.

Thank you in advance

Nope, that's not what you want.  It is a bug in &lt;ctype.h&gt; which is a
libc header file.

What's happing is that when you compile with optimization (i.e. any
option that starts with -O) some functions are replaced by optimizing
macros and/or inline functions (look for __OPTIMIZE__ in the libc
header files).  One of these functions is `tolower'.  However, the
optimized version of `tolower' happens to use a gcc extension, and
therefore you get an error when you compile with -pedantic-errors.

The bug will be fixed in the next release of glibc (version 2.1.2).
If you cannot wait until the official release (which isn't too far
ahead) you could try to install the test release
(glibc-2.1.2pre2.tar.gz somewhere on your favourite ftp.kernel.org
mirror).  Or you could fix the header file yourself by protecting the
__tobody code by __extension__.  Or compile without -pedantic-errors!

&gt; Yes, I know. But that really isn't a solution. I don't want to compile
&gt; without optimisation. What I want is the bug in ecgs to be fixed.

It is not a bug in egcs, it is a bug in glibc. With -O2, the
preprocessor expands your code to

int func (char *array)
{
  return ({ 
    int __res;	
    if (sizeof (array[0]) &gt; 1){	
      if (__builtin_constant_p (array[0])){
	int __c = (array[0]);
	__res = __c &lt; -128 || __c &gt; 255 ? __c : __ctype_tolower [__c];	
      }else
	__res = tolower(array[0]);
    }else
      __res = __ctype_tolower [(int) (array[0])];
    __res; 
  });
}

This is clearly not valid ISO C, so with -pedantic, the compiler must
complain. The fix is to tell it not to complain here, with

int func (char *array)
{
  return __extension__({ 
  ...

In glibc 2.1, this translates to

You will probably need at least -fno-rtti and -fno-exceptions
Quite possibly more as the kernel is it's own little world and doesn't
use any standard libraries.  So cutting all of the unavailable runtime libraries 
could be a challenge.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.6 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0809 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.6 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

If you use dlopen to load the shared library (analogous to LoadLibrary,
I think:-), and the shared library exports a symbol _init, dlopen will
call that before it returne.

C does not permit multiple definitions of the same name, I think.  C++
does.  Maybe if you can modify your 4gl to call g++ instead of gcc or
cc, it _might_ work.  I don't have much use for c++ :-)

Hi, Folks,

This is the beta release of gdb 4.17.0.13, which is based on gdb 4.17
plus Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint/FPU, glibc 2 pthread and Linux/PPC
support. You need linux 2.0.35 or above, or 2.1.xx to get the x86 FPU
to work correctly. The Linux/x86 binary works with all recent kernels
and C libraries, and the x86 FPU support is enabled at the run-time,
depending on the kernel version.

You need the latest glibc 2.1.1 to debug LinuxThreads.

Special thanks to Dan Bethe who provided the PowePC notebook which
makes the LinuxPPC support in gdb possible.

Please report any bugs related to gdb 4.17.0.13 to hjl@lucon.org.

Problems:

Because most of system calls in glibc 2 are written in assembly without
frame pointer, gdb may not be able to debug nor get stack trace system
calls on glibc-based 2 systems. Due to this, "make check" may fail in

FAIL: gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: backtrace through signal handler
FAIL: gdb.base/signals.exp: bt in signals.exp

with glibc 2.

Also, it is normal to see 

FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: continue (timeout)
FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: echo data (timeout)

if there is

XPASS: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: send_gdb end of file

Due to the new cplus-dem.c from gcc 2.95.1, you will get a few

FAIL: gdb.c++/demangle.exp: maint demangle __xxxxxxxxxx

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.12:

1. Update cplus-dem.c from gcc 2.95.1.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.11:

1. Support LinuxThreads on PowerPC.
2. Support P/III and AMD 3DNow! instructions.
3. Fix debugging dynamically loaded shared object.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.10:

1. Support glibc 2.0 and libc 5.
2. Support LinuxThreads on alpha.
3. Support Solaris 2.7/x86.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.9:

1. Fix support for glibc 2.1 pthread. Need the latest glibc 2.1, newer
   than 16:30pm PST of 19990-02-03.
2. Fix deleting the hardware watchpoint on x86.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.8:

1. The new cplus-dem.c from egcs 1999-01-12 with a bug fix.
2. Add support for deleting the hardware watchpoint on x86.
3. Update support for glibc 2.1 pthread.
4. Fix C++ testsuite.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.6:

1. Support for glibc 2.1 pthread. But it doesn't work, probably due
to the CLONE_PTRACE change to pthread in glibc 2.1.
2. Add support for the older Linux C libraries.
3. Add -static support for glibc 2.1.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.5:

1. Support for glibc 2.0 pthread. It doesn't work with glibc 2.1.
2. The Linux/PPC support.
3. The Linux/Sparc support. Untested.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.4:

1. Fix the Intel FPU tag code handling.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.3:

1. Fix testcases for FPU.
2. Fix x86 hardware watchpoint support.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.2:

1. Fake FP registers on older kernels.

Changes from gdb 4.17:

1. Linux/x86 FPU support is added. You can debug floating point numbers
   just like integers.
2. x86 hardware watchpoint is extended to long long, double and long
   double.
3. More information on x86 CPU status register.
4. Fix a bug when reading beyond the memory boundary.

What is the standard behaviour of a compiled C program which declares an
array which is too big given the system's available memory?

Whenever I use dynamic memeory I always test for malloc's error codes,
but it occurred to me that I don't test anything to make sure an array
has been properly allocated.  Should I be testing something?

  The system should not be able to load the program if it does not fit into
memory. If the program is running, it means that all the static variables
are 'allocated'.

AFAIK the memory is virtually allocated, not physically. Real allocation
takes places, when the memory is used. Am I wrong?

&gt;     ^^^^^^

IIRC, static applied to a global valiable means that the variable can be used
only in the current module. So static affects the scope of the variable, and
has nothing to do with memory allocation. `static int v[100]' is the same with
`int v[100]' in a single module program. If static is applied to a local
variable in a function, then the variable is preserved between different
calls.
In the matter of the init of the array, if the program loads then the array is
ok. (arrays generally exist within the program -
except if you use -fconserve-space wich is a different case)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I only have easy access to an x86 and Arm machine (well, there is the

&gt; Have you tried gdb 4.18 on Linux? It lacks many important features
&gt; added/fixed in gdb 4.17.0.x.

Just the same, gdb 4.18 has a number of bug fixes and other improvements.
Unless you plan to create a permanent fork, life will be easier if you
manage to create patches off of 4.18 (including some of your 4.17.0.x
features not included in 4.18); this will, I think, make it easier for the
gdb team to eventually include your changes.

I notice that you didn't include the gdb maintainance address on your
announcement.  Was that an accident?

Hello,
    We are developper in Financial Sector. Now we try to port our
application writing with 4gl tool from Informix from platform AIX to
Linux.  We found that c compiler on Linux can not support multiple
definition of funtion name, here is the error message

        [informix@sbaweb post]$ c4gl mainlink.4gl sub1link.4gl
sub2link.4gl -o mainlink
        /tmp/cca011523.o: In function `local_cal':
        /tmp/cca011523.o(.text+0x11c): multiple definition of
`local_cal'
        /tmp/cca011522.o(.text+0xf8): first defined here
        [informix@sbaweb post]$

On AIX and Solaris x86 there were no error, actually we have to use some
option for linking program on Solaris to work correctly but for AIX
there was no problem. So I would like to know that c compiler or linking
program  on Linux can support multiple definition or not because we
cannot find option that might help us. Our programs use a lot of
multiple definition and we do not have much time to re-write them and We
think this feature is a must for complier in order to link libs or
shared modules.Do you have any suggestion for us ?

&gt; C does not permit multiple definitions of the same name, I think.  C++
&gt; does.  Maybe if you can modify your 4gl to call g++ instead of gcc or

No, C++ only allows multiple functions with the same name if they have
different type signatures (i.e., take different arguments).

No. Most likely, it's a bug in your code.

Hi, Ralf,

You can send me MIPS patches when you are ready. In the meantime, I'd
like to start testing on other archs.

Thanks.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.7 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0813 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.7 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

hi,

I compiled the same program with egcs-1.1.2 ans gcc-2.95 without any
problems. Maybe it is because of the glibc that you are using. Suggest you
try compiling with gcc-2.95.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Hi, all. I've just tried compiling some code on a RedHat 6.0 system,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and ran across a problem. I've written some test code that
&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrates the problem:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; % cat egcs-example.c
&gt; &gt; &gt; #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; int func (char *array)
&gt; &gt; &gt; {
&gt; &gt; &gt;     return tolower (array[0]);
&gt; &gt; &gt; }
&gt; &gt; &gt; % cc -c -Wall -pedantic-errors -O2 egcs-example.c
&gt; &gt; &gt; egcs-example.c: In function `func':
&gt; &gt; &gt; egcs-example.c:5: ANSI C forbids braced-groups within expressions
&gt; &gt; &gt; % gcc -v
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
&gt; &gt; &gt; gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It has to do with some interaction between -O2 optimization and tolower(),
&gt; &gt; it appears.  Behold, for the above code:
&gt; &gt; $ gcc -c -Wall -pedantic-errors mtest.c
&gt; &gt; $ gcc -c -Wall -pedantic-errors -O2 mtest.c
&gt; &gt; mtest.c: In function `func':
&gt; &gt; mtest.c:5: ANSI C forbids braced-groups within expressions
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In short, if you drop the -O2 optimization, it compiles. At least it
&gt; &gt; did on my system.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I know. But that really isn't a solution. I don't want to compile
&gt; without optimisation. What I want is the bug in ecgs to be fixed.

The only header file I could find that would cause this is the libc5
bsd/sgtty.h.  I don't have the latest and greatest, only glibc-2.0.6 and
libc-5.4.44.  If you want to try just giving it bsd_ioctl, it is defined
in libbsd-compat.a, which should be included with either libc5 or 6.

To trace what headers you are using, you can do

gcc -E ... |grep include [|less]  or so.

I assume that you're asking this question with a DOS background.  Note
that memory managment for UNIX processes works very different from
what you may be used to under DOS.  So depending from what you may
want to archieve there may not be a direct equivalent to what you're
trying to achieve.  So you better describe what you're trying to do.

Hi All,

Is there a way to specify a function in a shared to be called when a shared
object is loaded under linux (ELF)?
I am looking for the equivalent of win32's DllMain, a function which is called
after all the static constructors, but before initialization of the shared lib
is complete.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

After more work than I expected (of the "track it down and tweak it"
variety), I have finally come up with a threads patch for GDB 4.18 (on
Linux) that I'm happy with (at least for now).

I'd encourage people to try this out (either via this patch or the RPM
package gdb-4.18-3 which should be in Rawhide within a week or so -
see http://developer.redhat.com/ for more on Rawhide and our
bug-tracking system and what-not).

The patch is at:

This indicates that you have triggered a bug in ld; the file it refers
to is part of the sources to ld, so you shouldn't necessarily expect
to have a copy on your system.  To report it, you should follow the
directions in the Info node (binutils)Reporting Bugs.  [If you're
unfamiliar with Info, you can do this by running

        info '(binutils)Reporting Bugs'

hitting the space bar to scroll through the text, and typing q when done.]

It's been rumoured that Piriya Kevalee said:
&gt; Linux.  We found that c compiler on Linux can not support multiple
&gt; definition of funtion name, here is the error message
&gt; 
&gt;         [informix@sbaweb post]$ c4gl mainlink.4gl sub1link.4gl

&gt;         [informix@sbaweb post]$
&gt; 
&gt; Our programs use a lot of
&gt; multiple definition and we do not have much time to re-write them and We
&gt; think this feature is a must for complier in order to link libs or
&gt; shared modules.Do you have any suggestion for us ?

You won't find this suggestion useful, but:

Multiple definitions of the same struct are bound to lead to serious
and fundamental programming errors.  If a user modifes a struct in one 
place and forgets to modify it in other places, you will have some very 
difficult to diagnose &amp; track down bugs.

If I was less kind I would say this is a sign of bad programming.
If I were lead architect/manager, I'd escalate fixing this to a high priority.
I'll bet you will discover &amp; fix a lot of bugs in the process.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.8 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0821 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.8 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs

&gt; &gt; This is the beta release of gdb 4.17.0.13, which is based on gdb 4.17
&gt; &gt; plus Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint/FPU, glibc 2 pthread and Linux/PPC
&gt; &gt; support. 
&gt; 
&gt; Given that 4.18 is the current gdb release, why are you releasing a
&gt; fork off of the old version?
&gt; 
&gt; 

Have you tried gdb 4.18 on Linux? It lacks many important features
added/fixed in gdb 4.17.0.x. People have been working on it. But it
may not be there until 4.19. So for the time being, Linux has to use
gdb 4.17.0.x if you want to debug thread, FPU and reliable hardware
watchpoint on x86.

BTW, I am working a patch for AMD new chip. I will make 4.17.0.14 after
I get confirmation.

  How did you declare the constructor? It should not return anything - it
should not be even 'void'

If you don't use "static", your array is allocated in the call stack, I 
think, "static" also make your array allocated in the globe memory. You 
can write a small program, it has a large array, a loop asign value to 
all the elements, then you can find the difference. 
In slackware3.4, gcc 2.7.2, largest array is about 8M if no "static",
it can reach your "physical memory" + "virtual memory" size if you use 
"static".

&gt; &gt;     ^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; IIRC, static applied to a global valiable means that the variable can be used
&gt; only in the current module. So static affects the scope of the variable, and
&gt; has nothing to do with memory allocation. `static int v[100]' is the same with
&gt; `int v[100]' in a single module program. If static is applied to a local
&gt; variable in a function, then the variable is preserved between different
&gt; calls.
&gt; In the matter of the init of the array, if the program loads then the array is
&gt; ok. (arrays generally exist within the program -
&gt; except if you use -fconserve-space wich is a different case)

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.10 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0831 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I am planning to make the public release soon. Please test it as much
as you can.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.10 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.4.0.8 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0710 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.4.0.8 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar

I think it's supposed to be considered an opaque type, unless you are the
maintainer of the code that implements it. :-/  That said, it eventually
becomes either a struct or a long long int (depending on whether __GNUC__
is defined) in /usr/include/bits/types.h .  64-bit offsets have been in
the works for some time now.

Nevertheless it would be unwise to assume anything about such quantities
in the absence of a documented commitment to a particular representation.

Write all the directorys into /etc/ld.so.conf . Then run ldconfig.
So if your libs are in /home/user/libs add the line '/home/user/lib'
to /etc/ld.so.conf

Hello,

Anyone there?

I'm moving my application to a recent Caldera release and find that
there's been a dirty trick played on those of us who have been
compiling under gcc.  We are now forced to compile under egcs.

My big remaining problem is with streampos which has grown from 4
bytes on the old system to 8 bytes in the new compiler.

I'm trying to figure out what the 8 bytes are.  I grep in the header
files and it seems to go through a few #defines and eventually it's a
"streamoff" but I can't find what that is.

Can anyone tell me what this is about or how I learn about it?

Stuck,

I haven't experienced this, but somewhere I've found
under the gcc directorytree there is a hard to read
configuration file, where such information is stored.

I haven't found any docs about this file yet,  though
I haven't looked out for them carefully enough.

Problem is that you have take care of this file when
installing new gcc releases.

&gt; Linux Gurus,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to create a character based (i.e. NOT X11 based!!)
programme
&gt; that is trying to use the ncurses library. The server is a Red Hat 5.1
&gt; installation running on a Compaq Prolinea 4/50 at this stage although
it is
&gt; intended to upgrade the hardware to a Compaq Celeron 400 processor box.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem comes in the form of the "standard" *nix error message of
&gt; Segmentation Fault (core dumped).....  :-(

gdb is quite adept at reading core dumps, if the program and/or
libraries involved were compiled with -g. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I have traced the actual instance of the segmentation fault (using gdb)
back
&gt; to the ncurses library where it is trying to refresh the screen
display.
&gt; 
&gt; My query is two-fold:
&gt; (1) where can I get the "ncurses_g" library that the ncurses(3X) man
page
&gt; talks about, as the only "ncurses_g" file that I have is a ".a" file
that
&gt; looks to be machine readable but is not a library (i.e. ".so.") file.

That is the one.  A .a file is a library.  It just isn't a shared
library, so each program that links with gets its own copy of the object
files it needs.  This makes it a _lot_ easier to debug code that causes
a fault in the library, so debugging libraries are often .a files.

&gt; (2) while I am reasonably comfortable with the ncurses library not
having a
&gt; bug in it, that is, my code at the higher level is causing the flow-on
&gt; segmentation fault, I am at a complete loss as to where I can even
begin to
&gt; start looking for what may be causing this problem!  :-(   Is there
anyone
&gt; out there that has written code for character based programmes that can
give
&gt; me some clues? It may just be as simple as how I am initialising the
ncurses
&gt; data structures, or heap allocations, or .......  ???

If you are able to use gdb to find what library it's faulting in, you
are very close to using gdb to find out what in your program caused it.
Compile your program withh the -g flag if you haven't already, link with
libncurses_g for good measure, and run it with gdb.  When it faults,just
move up the stack till you get to something you wrote. :-).  That will
likely be a call to an ncurses function that has some argument that is
not as the function expects.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help at all will be most gratefully received. Also, any pointers to
&gt; sample code that I can look at would be of use as well.
&gt; 
bpe is a lovely little utility I use as a framework any time I want to
mess with ncurses.  I don't know of anywhere it is except in the
slackware distro, the bin backage IIRC in the a disk set.  Of coures,
you would want the source, so it would be in
slackware/[version]/source/a/bin/bpe.tar.gz or so, on any slackware
mirror.

If slackware hasn't gone glibc yet, you might have to change some
&lt;linux/bla.h&gt; to &lt;sys/bla.h&gt; to get it to compile on RedHat.  I don't
remember anything else I've needed to do since I switched to glibc
nearly 2 years ago.

Nearest to you would be ftp.manawatu.gen.nz/pub/linux/slackware, but
that is from an old mirrors list, so it might have moved.  You could
always get a fresh MIRRORS.TXT at ftp.cdrom.com, or find bpe there.


&gt; Many thanks in advance.

Gurus,

In reading the documentation for ncurses, it informs me that I can get a
trace file for the ncurses routines by setting the trace level to a
sufficient value. I have tried using the trace() function (with a value of
TRACE_ORDINARY | TRACE_CALLS) and while it executes successfully when I run
my programme, no trace file is produced.

Is there anything else that I need to do to be able to get these trace
files?

Thanks for any help available.

Hi, at first, i must thank Raju. K.V. for his answer.
The reason why I read the setjmp.h file is that I want to write a =
program which will do the following:
At one checkpoint, the program copies the stack of the process to a =
file. Then at the next checkpoint, the program will decide whether =
restore the stack from the former file or not according to some =
conditions.
At first I think setjmp/longjmp can do the job, but after some work, I =
find that setjmp/longjmp can only restore the stack context, but not =
content of the stack. Then how can I copy and restore the stack?

Thanks in advance.

Fred

Yes, I have compiled with the -g flag. As far as I can tell, neither of the
-s flags are used, nor is the strip command used.

&gt; Gurus,
&gt; 
&gt; In reading the documentation for ncurses, it informs me that I can get a
&gt; trace file for the ncurses routines by setting the trace level to a
&gt; sufficient value. I have tried using the trace() function (with a value of
&gt; TRACE_ORDINARY | TRACE_CALLS) and while it executes successfully when I run
&gt; my programme, no trace file is produced.

Do you have write permissions in the execution directory?  You also have to
link against libncurses_g, the debugging library.

Hi there,
         I suppose the path where the library is present should be appended to
the LIBRARY env variable. I suppose the correct way to do that is to set the 
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH path.

Hope this helps,

I think gcc doesn't care about ld.so.conf (although it would be a nice
feature).
This is only for dynamic linker to find the shared libs.

&gt; Write all the directorys into /etc/ld.so.conf . Then run ldconfig.
&gt; So if your libs are in /home/user/libs add the line '/home/user/lib'

Hi, all.  I'm in the rather painful position of trying to put together a
multithreaded-capable libc5 environment.  Since there are also binaries
on the system that are not MT-aware (netscape, for example, becomes
particularly useless when linked with a threadsafe libX11.so), I've put
all my threadsafe libraries in /usr/local/lib/MT-safe.  I want to set up
gcc to go fetch them from there (and prefer them to their non-threadsafe
equivalents in the normal link path) anytime libpthread is linked in.
This seemed to have an obvious solution.  I added:

%{lpthread:-L/usr/local/lib/MT-safe}

to the *lib line of my specs file, and added:

%{lpthread:--rpath /usr/local/lib/MT-safe

to the *link line.

I tried compiling a program with both -v and -lpthread on the command line,
and I did not see either of these two arguments passed to the linker.  I
triple-checked the spelling and syntax of everything.  On a lark, I changed
the first to:

%{v:-L/usr/local/lib/MT-safe}

and again compiled with both -v and -lpthread.  This time, the -L argument
was passed to the linker and the --rpath was not.  It appears gcc is not
using -l options as decision keys in the specs file (but it is using -v!).

Has anyone else encountered this?  Is there a good reason for it?  Do more
recent versions of gcc/egcs fix this (I'm currently using 2.7.2.3)?

Does anyone have any other suggestions for how I might set up gcc to
automatically use the threadsafe libraries when appropriate?

Thanks much for any insight...

This should fix the libc 5 problem.

H.J. Lu (hjl@gnu.org)
--
This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.5.0.3 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0719 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

I merged a MIPS gas patch from binutils 2.9.1.0.25 to the current
binutils and there are many changes in MIPS/ELF in bfd. I'd like to
hear reports on Linux/MIPS.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.5.0.3 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

I am trying to create a character based (i.e. NOT X11 based!!) programme
that is trying to use the ncurses library. The server is a Red Hat 5.1
installation running on a Compaq Prolinea 4/50 at this stage although it is
intended to upgrade the hardware to a Compaq Celeron 400 processor box.

My problem comes in the form of the "standard" *nix error message of
Segmentation Fault (core dumped).....  :-(

I have traced the actual instance of the segmentation fault (using gdb) back
to the ncurses library where it is trying to refresh the screen display.

My query is two-fold:
(1) where can I get the "ncurses_g" library that the ncurses(3X) man page
talks about, as the only "ncurses_g" file that I have is a ".a" file that
looks to be machine readable but is not a library (i.e. ".so.") file.
(2) while I am reasonably comfortable with the ncurses library not having a
bug in it, that is, my code at the higher level is causing the flow-on
segmentation fault, I am at a complete loss as to where I can even begin to
start looking for what may be causing this problem!  :-(   Is there anyone
out there that has written code for character based programmes that can give
me some clues? It may just be as simple as how I am initialising the ncurses
data structures, or heap allocations, or .......  ???

Any help at all will be most gratefully received. Also, any pointers to
sample code that I can look at would be of use as well.

Many thanks in advance.

Regards,
MikeH

Yes, I do have write permissions, and yes I did link in the ncurses_g
library. Still no joy.

&gt; Gurus,
&gt; 
&gt; In reading the documentation for ncurses, it informs me that I can get a
&gt; trace file for the ncurses routines by setting the trace level to a
&gt; sufficient value. I have tried using the trace() function (with a value of
&gt; TRACE_ORDINARY | TRACE_CALLS) and while it executes successfully when I
run
&gt; my programme, no trace file is produced.

Do you have write permissions in the execution directory?  You also have to
link against libncurses_g, the debugging library.

Post the smallest complete program you can that demonstrates the problem

This problem was previously mentioned:

http://www.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/1999week27/0326.html
http://www.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/1999week26/0796.html

Multiple threads calling gethostbyname_r() (and using DNS
to resolve) ends up with threads stuck in skb_recv_datagram.
This occurs under kernels up to 2.3.10 and 2.2.10ac12 with
glibc-2.1.1 and glibc-2.0.7. Under 2.0 kernels (including
2.0.37) it causes multiple oopses.

Python and C code to illustrate this problem are available:
ftp://ftp.pangalactic.org/pub/outgoing/pytest
ftp://ftp.pangalactic.org/pub/outgoing/thrtest.c

I've received only one comment on this problem. Alan
Cox did suggest that the oops in 2.0 kernels had been
fixed under 2.0.37, but it has not.

I've posted this again to the kernel-list to note that the
problem still occurs under the latest AC release. I've also
directed it to the linux-gcc list since the problem under
2.2 and 2.3 may well be in glibc and not related to the
kernel oopses under 2.0, as was my first impression.

Any comments or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Hello, 
  As some may know I have been working on em86 , however I have a problem 
I can't seem to find an answer to . Whenever I run em86 I get the following 
error message: 

./em86: Unknown relocation type 

My issue is how is this possible. 
- I have compared the headers (elf structure) and there appears to be no 
differences. 
- There is a linker directive file but It dosen't seem to cause other 
programs to generate this message. 

The real problem lies in the fact 6.0 ld.so has assertions turned on. This 
causes the excutable not to run ( even though it can.) 
Any pointers would be VERY helpful. 

Thank You

hi,

the typedef means type __jmp_buf is an 6 element array of type int. ie if
u declare
__jmp_buf xx;
it is equivalent to 
int xx[6];

&gt; Hi, at first, i must thank Raju. K.V. for his answer.
&gt; The reason why I read the setjmp.h file is that I want to write a 
&gt; program which will do the following:
&gt; At one checkpoint, the program copies the stack of the process to a 
&gt; file. Then at the next checkpoint, the program will decide whether 
&gt; restore the stack from the former file or not according to some 
&gt; conditions.
&gt; At first I think setjmp/longjmp can do the job, but after some work, I 
&gt; find that setjmp/longjmp can only restore the stack context, but not 
&gt; content of the stack. Then how can I copy and restore the stack?

The following is a quicky example that saves the stack.
The harder restoring, and context is left as an exercise.
Note:  None of this is truly portable, but with care you can
get it run on a fair variety of machines.

If you need an example I would suggest guile (or some other
interpreter that implements continuations in C).  Heck.  I
just about recommend guile anyway, or some other scheme dialect
because saving/restoring the stack is a builtin language construct.

But note.  Between one program invocation and another it is quite
possible nothing will work,  Changes in library version or, resulting
in code changing addresses, etc.

Eric


char *stack_bottom;
int main(void)
{
	char x;
	stack_bottom = 
	save_stack();
}

void save_stack()
{
	char x;
	really_save_stack(stack_bottom, &amp;x);
}

void really_save_stack(char *bottom, char *top)
{
	fp = fopen(....)
	if (bottom &gt; top) {
		fwrite(top, bottom - top, 1, fp);
	} else {
		fwrite(bottom, top - bottom, 1, fp);
	}
	fclose(fp);
}

caddr_t generally refers to a machine address...

I've seen it in sunos.  Probably modern software should just use void *.

I suppose caddr_t does not have to be a void * on machines where a
physical address cannot be represented by a pointer?

Its a good question...

Hi,

I forgot including some important Linux/ARM note on binutils 2.9.4.0.1.
If you use Linux/ARM, please make sure you read it first.

Sorry for that.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.4.0.1 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0605 plus various changes.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.4.0.1 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

Changes from binutils 1999 0605:

1. Fix a -Bsymbolic bug for Linux/alpha.
2. Add ELF/i370.
3. Fix 8/16-bit relocations for i386.
4. Add --redefine-sym=old_form=new_form to objcopy.
5. Add "-j section" for objcopy.
6. Fix i386 disassembler for fwait.
7. Fix a Sparc asm bug.
8. Add Ada demangle support.
9. Fix MIPS/ELF bugs.
10. Add some vxworks suppport.
11. Fix a.out assembler.

The file list:

1. binutils-2.9.4.0.1.tar.gz. Source code.
2. binutils-2.9.4.0.1-1.src.rpm. Source RPM.
3. binutils-2.9.4.0.1-1.i386.rpm. Binary RPM for RedHat 6.0.

changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

Thanks, but this offers me little help with what I am actually trying
to do. Nonetheless it did get me looking at the whole problem and I
decided that using "popen()" is not the best way to start the desired
process. Thus I am going to recode that part of the application using
pipes redirection of file descriptors, forking and replacing the child
with the desired process, reading it's output from stdout which will
be redirected into a pipe. All in all this will give me better control
of the whole thing, it will improve reliability and enable better
control over passing data and signals between the 2 processes and
eliminate some potential known bugs that are often  associated with
"popen()".

Anyway's thanks for the help.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.4.0.4 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0611 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.4.0.4 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has

Sounds like you did not compile in debugging symbols.

I have an application here that launches a process via the "popen()"
command.

For anyone unfamiliar popen()  works as follows:

            FILE *fp;   /* a FILE pointer */
              ...
            fp = popen(command, "r");

Where "command" is any common Unix command that can be run from the
shell written as it would be if run from the command line. For
example, "command" could be:
             char *command = "ls -l";
or anything that could be run in that manner. The "r" is the mode
which in this case specifies that the pipe will be used for reading.
What "popen()" essentially does is it opens a pipe, forks a new
(child) process and launches the command specified by "command". The
output of the command is then sent down the pipe and can be read in
the parent via the file pointer "fp" using something like "fread()".

Now here's the main question. The processed launched via "popen()"
from the parent process runs over a period of time. Is there a simple
way to kill the process that was started via "popen()" from the parent
process? I considered the possibility of sending a signal from the
parent to the process launched by popen() using  the "kill()" function
but "kill()" requires  knowledge of the pid of the process to which I
want the signal to be sent. Unfortunately "popen()" returns a file
pointer but nowhere does it return the pid of the process that was
started.

Thus the  question boils down to, is there a simple way for the parent
process to get the pid of the process that it stared via "popen()" so
that it could thereby send signals to it?  and/or is there a simple
way in which the parent can kill such a process? Perhaps there is but
I am just overlooking it.

or...

Would it make more sense to change the whole manner in which the
process is being started, for example, instead of using "popen()",
should I manually create a pipe via pipe(), fork a new process via
"fork()" and then replacing the child process with the desired command
using "exec()" and simply redirect the file descriptors so that
standard output from the desired command is sent down the pipe and can
thereby be read via a low level "read()"??

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank You.

Hi everybody

I recently installed an out-of-the box RedHat 6.0.
Since i have a Pentium II, i assume i would gain performance by
compiling with i686 optimizations, and maybe by recompiling kernel, KDE
and so on.......

So my question is : how do i do this ?
Do i need to recompile egcs ? glibs ? in which order ? with which flags
?
and after i compiled the libraries, do i need to change for instance
/etc/ld.so.conf ?

Could somebody point me at some documents ? Or simply answer on the
mailing-list ;-)

I tried to compile both egcs &amp; then glibc-2.1.1, but when i installed
(in /usr/local/lib), and tried to update my /etc/ld.so.conf (adding
/usr/local/lib &amp; then running ldconfig), i just ended crashing my system
(ie whenever i tried to launch a process, i go a message like 'can't
find ld-linux.so.2', and of course nothing did work at all...........)

Since i don't really enjoy booting from rescue disk &amp; moving the
/usr/local/lib dir to something else, i would appreciate some help ;-)

TIA for your answers

Hi,
         I am using red hat linux 5.2
          My GCC version is 2.7.2.3
         I am stuck at compiling c++ program .I wrote a simple
program to display a string .
          when I tried to compile it a file called cc1plus is not
found . What is this file ? I am using     iostream.h file  which it
could not find.This file does exist in header file list.

Then I downloaded  gccfrom one of GNU ftp sites. I downloaded
gcc-2.1-2.2.1.diff.gz
This is a zip file . How should I install this version ,? Please let
me know the step by step procedure of installation

I am a novice to linux OS.

Thanking You
Praveen

  Hello,
    i am writing a program that has as input a formula text (i.e. 
X+log(Y)*(W-Z))
 and i want to compute this formula many times for several values of X,Y,W,Z,
   how can i do it ? i need it to run quite fast around 300.000times/sec,
 i tried to write a little interpreter of the formula and i stored a sequence 
of
 functions and arguments and temporal variables used.. so that it works but i 
guess
 it should be easier,
  i have in mind other posibility that is to write the formula in a file and 
compile
 it and relink,.. but i dont know well how to do it and maybe it is even more 
copmlex
 and i have to do exactly the same but using conditions (i.e. W+Z&gt;4.and.Z&lt;1 
sorry, the
 users will be fortran fans)
      is there any library to do this ??
      can somebody help me or send me any sugesstion please ?

 thanks in advance, Cheers

There's some commercial ones, but they are expensive.

For compiling legacy apps, I use Lesstif (www.lesstif.org).

If you're writing something new, use a modern widget set (like GTK or QT).

Does anyone know of any good online tutorials or references dealing
with the topic of Semaphores under Unix/Linux. I am referring to a
reference or tutorial that deals with the topic of semaphores either
in the theoretical (abstract) sense, and their applied
implementations, both in System V and Posix, or both.

I am currently familiarizing myself with the topic via the book
"Practical Unix Programming - A Guide to Concurrency, Communication,
and Multithreading", Robbins &amp; Robbins, publ by Prentice Hall. While
this book seems to do an excellent (and probably adequate) job
covering the topic, I am also trying to locate some additional
resources as well.

Any recommendations would be appreciated


Sincerely,

John &lt;micros50@comoputer.net&gt;

&gt; If anyone could help me out with the following, it would be much
appreciated:
&gt; 
&gt;         I have compiled a relatively large C program with gcc (on a
linux
&gt; 486 machine) using: gcc prog.c -lgdbm
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the code defining some of the variables of one of the functions
is
&gt; as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;         datum key;
&gt;         datum key1;
&gt;         datum key2;
&gt;         datum key3;
&gt;         datum content;
&gt;         datum content1;
&gt;         datum content2;
&gt;         datum content3;
&gt; 
&gt; where datum is defined in the gdbm.h include file as :
&gt;         struct{
&gt;                 char *dptr;
&gt;                 int dsize;
&gt;                 } datum
&gt; 
&gt; However, the program constantly causes segmentation faults.  Examining
the
&gt; program using gdb (after compiling with "gcc prog.c -lgdbm -ggdb")
reveals
&gt; that key, key1, key2, key3, content, and content2 are all fine. ie.
using
&gt; "display content" in gdb returns:
&gt;         content={dptr=0xbffffa7c "0", dsize = 1}        
&gt;   However, using "display content1" in gdb reveals:
&gt;                 content1={dptr= 0x0, dsize =-1073743240}
&gt; and similarly for content3.  And the program causes the segementation
fault
&gt; at the line which calls content1 for the first time.

If gcc had been unable to allocate memory for content1, gdb would be
unable to display it.  Since it can in fact display it, but the content
is garbage, it looks to me like you have neglected to assign it any
initial value.  char *dptr doesn't allocate any char variable, only a
variable that can hold a pointer to one.  If you don't bother to put
one there, it might very well be zero, which will certainly segment
fault when you refer to it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From experience programming on other operating systems which shall
remain
&gt; anonymous, I figure I need to swtich to a larger memory model, or
something
&gt; else to allow gcc to allocate memory to content1 and content3 but
nothing in
&gt; the info, man, or other linux programming books tells me how to do
this.  Of
&gt; course, this preliminary diagnosis could be entirely wrong...
&gt; 
AFAIK there is only one memory model for real c.  Automatic variables
come out of the stack, which is finite (try ulimit -a to see what
limit), as do any recursions... if you have a great many variables, you
might make them static or define them outside of any function to put
them in the data segment instead, or malloc them, but I don't think that
is the problem.

&gt; I'm sorry for taking up so much bandwidth with this question, but the
fact
&gt; that out of 8 identical variable declarations 6 were fine and 2 were
not is
&gt; exceedingly puzzling -- normally things either always work or never
work...

My guess, and it's just a guess without seeing the relevant code, is that
you are failing properly to initialize the struct's members.

&gt; course, this preliminary diagnosis could be entirely wrong...

No such thing as "memory models" under Linux.  It is an abomination that
32-bit flat memory layouts nicely avoid.

&gt; I'm sorry for taking up so much bandwidth with this question, but the fact
&gt; that out of 8 identical variable declarations 6 were fine and 2 were not is
&gt; exceedingly puzzling -- normally things either always work or never work...

Post the smallest complete code sample that illustrates the bad behavior.
It is difficult to diagnose otherwise.

It's been rumoured that Berkeley Hynes said:

&gt; However, the program constantly causes segmentation faults.  Examining the

sounds like you're scribbling on memory. Trying using libefence ("electric fence")
it may help you find overruns in malloced memory.  There are also some commercial
tools that might help w/ memory management.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; Here we go:

./configure looks OK to me.

Why not give it a rule? :-)  It just wants to know how tocompile it.
Something like
grabber-scc.o:
 $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -o grabber-scc.o grabber-scc.c
or so.  :-)

-ltk8.o tells ld to look in its lib path for a file named libtk8.0.so or
so.  You're not showing me one in /usr/lib.  I bet it is installed in
/usr/local/lib.  IIRC, I built an earlier version of tcl/tk and by
default that is where it installed itself.  Try changing the -L/usr/lib
in the Makefile to /usr/local/lib, or maybe there is a ./configure
option to set.  First, of course, check in /usr/local/lib to see if
libtk8.0.so or .a is there. :-)

It is not necessary to repeat yourself in HTML.  Anybody who can help
you can and probably would rather read plain ascii text.

&gt; Well , the -ltk8.0 makes the linker search dor libtk8.0.so or libtk8.0.a
&gt; in /usr/lib ( and only there) .
&gt;  Making a link to the library in the tk8.0 directory should solve that

&gt; Or add a -L/usr/lib/tk8.0 before the -ltk8.0, so that the linker searchs

&gt; &gt; Well , the -ltk8.0 makes the linker search dor libtk8.0.so or
libtk8.0.a
&gt; &gt; in /usr/lib ( and only there) .
&gt; &gt;  Making a link to the library in the tk8.0 directory should solve

On the face of it, those symbols are defined in libc, so you could fix
this latest problem by adding -lc too the command line.  It wanted
libtk8.0.a in the first place (that is what -static is about) and I'm
not sure what further booby-traps you might proovoke by forcing it to
link with libtk8.0.so.  The usual reason to prefer the .a libraries is
that it is easier to debug code using them, or when the linked program
might be asked to run where or when the shared lib isn't available.
ldconfig, for example, should be static.  I don't know what Vic's reason
is, nor even what it is.  You could try ripping out the -shared, or
maybe look around for libtk8.0.a.  Usually the .a is in the same package
with the .so.

&gt;

What's wrong with fortran?  :-)

If it's a fortran formula, why not put a fortran wrapper on it and feed
it to the fortran compiler?  Then you can link your code with it and
call it with what values you like.  Wrap it with something like:

	implicit integer (a-z)
	function foo(w,x,y,z)
	foo=&lt;formula&gt;
	return
	end

My fortran might be a little rusty, but I think that should work.
 
&gt;       is there any library to do this ??
&gt;       can somebody help me or send me any sugesstion please ?
&gt; 
&gt;  thanks in advance, Cheers

  but each time the program runs with a different formula i will have to

 and not to jump from one to other (ie. using atexit from stdlib.h)
   is it possible to compile/link just a function and call it from the initial
 program (i mean, to add a function to the program while it is running in a way
 that i do not need to exit from the initial program ) ?

That makes your original question clearer.  Yes, it is possible.  You need
to fork a command that will build the function as a shared library (even
though in this case your library has only one member!) and then load it
explicitly rather than linking your main program with it.  The explicit
dynamic loading functions are in libdl (see `info ld.so libdl` for
details and examples).

You're going to learn a lot about dynamic linking along the way.
Unfortunately you can't learn much more of it from me, because I haven't
done this myself -- not on Unix, anyway.  But I know enough about the
facilities to believe that what you want can be done.

I'd be inclined to cobble the whole thing together into a shell script,
compiles, links, and all, but if you want to you can certainly just fork
and exec the fortran compile/link and load it with dlopen, amd it will
run faster that way.  Info libc is sometimes more helpful than the man
pages.

&gt; &gt;If it's a fortran formula, why not put a fortran wrapper on it and feed
&gt; &gt;it to the fortran compiler?  Then you can link your code with it and
&gt; &gt;call it with what values you like.
&gt;   but each time the program runs with a different formula i will have to
&gt;  compile again the code, and i will have to build a new executable file
&gt;  and run it, isn't it?   i would prefer to run a single executable code
&gt;  and not to jump from one to other (ie. using atexit from stdlib.h)
&gt;    is it possible to compile/link just a function and call it from the initial
&gt;  program (i mean, to add a function to the program while it is running in a way
&gt;  that i do not need to exit from the initial program ) ?

Hello, thank you very much for your mails, it was really helpfull,
&gt;You're going to learn a lot about dynamic linking along the way.
.. yes, i was reading a little about it, now what i need is to compile
some C and fortran functions to create the .so files,
  can somebody tell me how to compile them ? i had a look to the man but
i didnt found it, (i am working on linux and digital-unix)
   is there any faqs or little manual about dynamic linking ?
Cheers,
            Rafa

 &gt; Hi everybody

 &gt; So my question is : how do i do this ?

 &gt; and after i compiled the libraries, do i need to change for instance

Order doesn't matter, just compile those applications you think could
benefit from it.

 &gt; Could somebody point me at some documents ? Or simply answer on the
 &gt; mailing-list ;-)

 &gt; I tried to compile both egcs &amp; then glibc-2.1.1, but when i installed
 &gt; (in /usr/local/lib), and tried to update my /etc/ld.so.conf (adding
 &gt; /usr/local/lib &amp; then running ldconfig), i just ended crashing my system
 &gt; (ie whenever i tried to launch a process, i go a message like 'can't
 &gt; find ld-linux.so.2', and of course nothing did work at all...........)
Read the glibc FAQ first, especially question 3.18, then README and
INSTALL files.  You really should install with --prefix=/usr.

 &gt; Since i don't really enjoy booting from rescue disk &amp; moving the
 &gt; /usr/local/lib dir to something else, i would appreciate some help ;-)

I've been trying for at least two weeks to make an m68k-coff cross

figured I'd give it a try, but gas coredumps yet again, but in a
different place.  (This is with binutils-2.9.4.0.4)

All binutils have been configured with:

../configure --target=m68k-coff --enable-shared \
	--prefix=/usr/local/cross --exec-prefix=/usr/local/cross \
	--enable-targets=m68k-ieee

It's strange because if there are errors in the source, the assembler
dutifully reports them without segfaulting.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.4.0.5 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0612 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.4.0.5 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p


Changes from binutils 2.9.4.0.4:

1. Update from binutils 1999 0612.
2. Remove various temporary fixes of mine since those bugs are fixed
   now.

Changes from binutils 2.9.4.0.3:

1. Update from binutils 1999 0611.
2. Remove my ELF/Alpha bfd changes.
3. Use the local symbol copy fix in binutils 1999 0611.

Changes from binutils 2.9.4.0.2:

1. Update from binutils 1999 0607.
2. Remove my Sparc hacks.
3. Fix local symbol copy.

Changes from binutils 2.9.4.0.1:

1. Update from binutils 1999 0606.
2. Restore relocation overflow checking in binutils 2.9.1.0.25 so that
   Linux kernel can build.
3. Fix i370 for the new gas.

Changes from binutils 1999 0605:

1. Fix a -Bsymbolic bug for Linux/alpha.
2. Add ELF/i370.
3. Fix 8/16-bit relocations for i386.
4. Add --redefine-sym=old_form=new_form to objcopy.
5. Add "-j section" for objcopy.
6. Fix i386 disassembler for fwait.
7. Fix a Sparc asm bug.
8. Add Ada demangle support.
9. Fix MIPS/ELF bugs.
10. Add some vxworks suppport.
11. Fix a.out assembler.

&gt; I recently installed an out-of-the box RedHat 6.0.  Since i have a
&gt; Pentium II, i assume i would gain performance by compiling with i686
&gt; optimizations, and maybe by recompiling kernel, KDE and so on.......

I think it is questionable whether you'll see any significant
speed-up. The only advantage of doing this: You'll learn a lot about
Linux :-)

&gt; So my question is : how do i do this ?
&gt; Do i need to recompile egcs ? glibs ? in which order ?

You can recompile any of them, in any order. Problems arise if you
compile and install a *different* version from the one you are
currently using.

If you are interested in installing the same version, I'd recommend to
use source RPMs. Please see the RPM documentation on how to rebuild
packages from source RPMs.

You don't need to recompile egcs - unless you want egcs itself to run
faster, or unless you want to upgrade to a more recent version. Please
see the egcs documentation for installation instructions.

You can also configure egcs to use a different architecture by default
- in which case you don't need to pass additional flags in the later
recompilations.

&gt; I tried to compile both egcs &amp; then glibc-2.1.1, but when i installed
&gt; (in /usr/local/lib), and tried to update my /etc/ld.so.conf (adding
&gt; /usr/local/lib &amp; then running ldconfig), i just ended crashing my system
&gt; (ie whenever i tried to launch a process, i go a message like 'can't
&gt; find ld-linux.so.2', and of course nothing did work at all...........)

In order to re-install glibc, it is not sufficient to just recompile
it: you need to install it. Please read the glibc documentation on how
to do this. Updating from 2.0 to 2.1 is not trivial, so read the
documentation carefully.

&gt; Since i don't really enjoy booting from rescue disk &amp; moving the
&gt; /usr/local/lib dir to something else, i would appreciate some help ;-)

First read all documentation, then start compiling. Reading everything
might well take a day or so.

Regards,
Martin

&gt; Hi,
&gt;          I am using red hat linux 5.2
&gt;           My GCC version is 2.7.2.3
&gt;          I am stuck at compiling c++ program .I wrote a simple
&gt; program to display a string .
&gt;           when I tried to compile it a file called cc1plus is not
&gt; found . What is this file ? I am using     iostream.h file  which it
&gt; could not find.This file does exist in header file list.

But does it exist in /usr/include?  That is where the compiler looks for
it.  To compile programs on a RedHat system you need the -devel rpms for
each of the libraries the program uses.  In the case of c++, that is
glibc-devel and libg++-devel, as well as glibc- and libg++.  These are
all included in the standard RedHat distro, but you led the install to
believe you didn't want some of them.  A compiler is useless without
libraries.  You can use rpm -q to see if you have a package, or
rpm -qa |grep &lt;package name&gt; or rpm -qa |less.

&gt; 
&gt; Then I downloaded  gccfrom one of GNU ftp sites. I downloaded
&gt; gcc-2.1-2.2.1.diff.gz
&gt; This is a zip file . How should I install this version ,? Please let
&gt; me know the step by step procedure of installation

This is not a version of gcc at all.  If you have the source of gcc-2.1
installed, you can use this file to update ("patch") it to gcc-2.2.1.
Both these versions of gcc are thoroughly obsolete.  There is nothing
wrong with the gcc you have.  It just needs libraries and header files
to work with.
&gt; 
&gt; I am a novice to linux OS.

If you have g77, it _should_ behave like gcc:  to make  a shared library
you just need -shared..

g77 -o foo.so -shared foo.f

or so.  If you don't, perhaps there is one at
metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/fortran

fort77 looks like it would also work with -shared, is smaller, and does
not interfere with gcc. But it is a Perl script.  About half of the
linux system commands are scripts of one sort or another. :-)


&gt;    is there any faqs or little manual about dynamic linking ?
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;             Rafa
&gt; 
All I know about dynamic linking I learned from info -f ld.so and man
dlopen, and the school of hard knocks. :-)  The knocks aren't terribly
hard.

There are commercial libraries available from many vendors, typically about $50 for a

The Linux Programmer's Guide &lt;http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/LDP/lpg/index.html&gt;
discusses semaphores (and the other SysV IPC mechanisms).  There's
also some documentation at the Info node (libc)Posix Semaphores.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.4.0.7 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 1999 0626 plus various changes. It is purely for
Linux, although it has been tested on Solaris/Sparc and Solaris/x86
from time to time.

Please report any bugs related to binutils 2.9.4.0.7 to hjl@lucon.org.

For arm-linux targets, there are some important differences in behaviour 
between these tools and binutils 2.9.1.0.x.  The linker emulation name has 
changed from elf32arm{26} to armelf_linux{26}.  Also, the "-p" flag must be 
passed with the linker when working with object files (or static libraries) 
created using older versions of the assembler.  If this flag is omitted the 
linker will silently generate bad output when given old input files.

To get the correct behaviour from gcc, amend the *link section of your specs 
file as follows:

*link:
%{h*} %{version:-v}    %{b} %{Wl,*:%*}    %{static:-Bstatic}    %{shared:-shared
}    %{symbolic:-Bsymbolic}    %{rdynamic:-export-dynamic}    %{!dynamic-linker:
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2}    -X    %{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mapcs-26:-m ar
melf_linux26} %{!mapcs-26:-m armelf_linux} -p

1. Update from binutils 1999 0626.

Changes from binutils 2.9.4.0.5:

1. Update from binutils 1999 0620.
2. Remove my fwait fix and use the one in cvs.
3. Use "--only-section=section" instead of "--extract-section=section".
   for objcopy.

Changes from binutils 2.9.4.0.4:

1. Update from binutils 1999 0612.
2. Remove various temporary fixes of mine since those bugs are fixed

If anyone could help me out with the following, it would be much appreciated:

        I have compiled a relatively large C program with gcc (on a linux
486 machine) using: gcc prog.c -lgdbm

Part of the code defining some of the variables of one of the functions is
as follows:

        datum key;
        datum key1;
        datum key2;
        datum key3;
        datum content;
        datum content1;
        datum content2;
        datum content3;

where datum is defined in the gdbm.h include file as :
        struct{
                char *dptr;
                int dsize;
                } datum

However, the program constantly causes segmentation faults.  Examining the
program using gdb (after compiling with "gcc prog.c -lgdbm -ggdb") reveals
that key, key1, key2, key3, content, and content2 are all fine. ie. using
"display content" in gdb returns:
        content={dptr=0xbffffa7c "0", dsize = 1}        
  However, using "display content1" in gdb reveals:
                content1={dptr= 0x0, dsize =-1073743240}
and similarly for content3.  And the program causes the segementation fault
at the line which calls content1 for the first time.

From experience programming on other operating systems which shall remain
anonymous, I figure I need to swtich to a larger memory model, or something
else to allow gcc to allocate memory to content1 and content3 but nothing in
the info, man, or other linux programming books tells me how to do this.  Of
course, this preliminary diagnosis could be entirely wrong...

I'm sorry for taking up so much bandwidth with this question, but the fact
that out of 8 identical variable declarations 6 were fine and 2 were not is
exceedingly puzzling -- normally things either always work or never work...

Thanks in advance for any help,

A college of mine is working with egcs.  I realize this isn't strictly
Linux-oriented, but it raised my curiosity - how does one deal with &gt;64
bit ints with egcs/gcc?

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Subject: gnu c large int's

I'm trying to get some code working under Windows using Cygnus's g++, using
128-bit ints, using

typef long int128 __attribute__ ((mode(TI)));

First off, I'm getting link error'ss when I try to basic arithmetic on
them -

	multiplacation needs __multi3
	shift right needs    __ashrti3

and so on (addition seems ok). I can't find these functions in any of the
supplied libraries... or are these unimplemented RTF functions ?

Also, if I can get this working, any ideas on how to printf a large int ?
Variable arguments are a pain in the arse, coz normally everythings
converted to 'long' on the stack... but obviously the high order bits will
drop off in the conversion of an int128...

Thanks for any help....

Dear all,
     I want to modify a object's value via a iterator, for example,

     this statement:

           (*i).id=0;

     can not pass the compiler, "..." is the allocator.
     How can I declare a no-const iterator in gcc STL?

&gt; Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some page somewhere that tracks the current status of glibc2?
&gt; 
&gt; o	The FSF glibc page still says that 2.0 is the latest.
&gt; 
&gt; o	The FSF ftp archive still says that 2.1 is withdrawn due to
&gt; 	political issues.
&gt; 
&gt; o	http://glibc.cygnus.com/ takes me to the EGCS page, which makes no
&gt; 	mention of glibc.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically a lot of people have no clue where to find 2.1, and some of us
&gt; who do know where it is are not sure whether we ought to use it.  I think
&gt; you'd get more testers if these issues were resolved.

Hi all

I have problems compiling programs written in C with XView extensions.
Although I've added X11/Xlib.h, xview/generic.h, xview/xview.h, and
widget-related xview includes, and run gcc with libraries libX11,
libxview and libolgx (those necessary to get xview-based programs
compiled), linking exits with errors, saying that some references are
missing - (references to functions contained in libX11.a) 
Can you tell me what's wrong?
Am I omitting anything?

PD: I don't know if I'm using the right list to ask this. If not,
please tell me where can I go.

Thank you in advance!

I suspect that I've configured something incorrectly; however, it isn't
clear to me exactly what that might be.  With that said; here's the reason
why i'm asking for advice:

gcc -nostdlib -nostartfiles -o /src/glibc/glibc/db2/makedb  -Wl,-dynamic-lin

Now, with that out of the way, let's go on with the pertinent
information:

-- Versions installed: (if some fields are empty or looks
-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)

I'm using make 3.76.1, according to the FAQ, this should be adequate;
however, the FAQ does note that there have been reports of problems
related to the aforementioned version of make.  The error message I'm
receiving is not a 'make' related issue, but an issue with the linker
(ld).  Additionally, the FAQ mentions that 'gettext-0.10.35' and 'gperf'
might be needed, but it goes on to say that these are necessary only if
one modifies the source code (I have not done so).

So, here's the procedure I used to build glibc-2.1:

Unpack everything:

	gunzip -v ../glibc-2.1-2.1.1pre1.diff.gz
	gunzip -v ../glibc-2.1.1pre1-2.1.1pre2.diff.gz
	tar -zxvf glibc-2.1.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf glibc-crypt-2.0.111.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.1pre2.tar.gz
	mv crypt glibc-2.1/.
	mv linuxthreads glibc-2.1/.

Apply patches:

	cd glibc-2.1
	patch -p1 &lt; ../glibc-2.1-2.1.1pre1.diff &gt; ../log.patch.1 2&gt;&amp;1
	patch -p1 &lt; ../glibc-2.1.1pre1-2.1.1pre2.diff &gt; ../log.patch.2 2&gt;&amp;1

Check that the patches applied OK:

	less ../log.patch.[12]

Read INSTALL:

	less INSTALL

Prepare for build:

	On my first attempt, I issued the './configure ...' command shown
	below.	I received an error message indicating that it would
	be better to move the '/usr/include' directory out of the way.
	This seemed like a reasonable suggestion to me (at least not
	'un-reasonable'), so that is why I performed the next step.

	su - root
	cd /usr
	mv include include.save
	mkdir include
	cd include
	ln -s ../src/linux/include/asm asm
	ln -s ../src/linux/include/linux linux
	exit

Configure for build:

	mkdir glibc
	cd glibc
	../glibc-2.1/configure \
		--prefix=/usr \
		--host=i686-pc-linux-gnu \
		--build=i686-pc-linux-gnu \
		--enable-add-ons

	(Yes, '--prefix=/usr' is probably not the smartest thing to
	do ... letting 'prefix' default to '/usr/local' yields the same
	error message)

Start build:

	make

Thus, I arrived at the error message listed in the beginning of this message.
Have I missed an important step in the configuration procedure?  If anyone
has some insight as to where I've gone wrong; please let me know what it
is so that I can correct my oversight.  I assume that this could also be a
'bug'; however, i'd prefer not to make that claim.

Thank you for your time and 'cc:'

Hi,

I haven't heard a peep about new versions of egcs or glibc 
in many months.  A month ago, I dropped a patch for s/390
egcs-1.1.2 and it echoed like a bottomless pit.  I have 
a new improved patch ready ... I am concerned ... are the 
maintainers overworked?

I also have a patch ready against glibc-2.1 for s/390.  Who 
wants that?  Where do I send it to make it official?

==========
I'm asking these questions because by contrast H.J. Lu does 
a marvelous job maintaining binutils; when I send a patch,
I know its received &amp; I see a new rev of binutils a few 
days/weeks later.  It gives me the warm fuzzies that its
getting out there.

sorry, just another note.

i know that the libstdc++ package documentation says that it should be
used with g++ 2.8.0 or greater, but since i am running libc5 on kernel
2.0.35 and gcc 2.7.2.3 at the moment, is it possible to compile the gcc
2.8.1 package but ONLY to install the g++ binary.

is that possible?

if not, could people point me in the direction of what other bins are
required for g++ to work; ie i'm running gcc2.7.2.3, but what to
compile gcc2.8.1 and ONLY install the g++ compiler;

current system: kernel-2.0.35, gcc/g++ 2.7.2.3, libc5

i want to do this since, when i installed gcc2.8.1 and compiled my
2.0.35 kernel (i dont have enough resources to go to glib2 and kernel
2.2.xx) many things  broke and i've had advice via this newsgroup that
i shouldnt be compiling the 2.0.xx kernels with gcc 2.8.1

thanking you in advance again

    I'm not exactly sure what's going on here.  I'm running glibc v2.0.6 on

    Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                                                                    Thanks -- Matt

Greetings,
	I've been compiling some programs for quite some time that have had
problems with one of the kernel header files, genhd.h.  They use the
partition structure which used to look like this:

struct partition { yada yada } __((packed))__;

and the compiler freaked out and had (I think) a parse error before the ;. 
Now the new versions (of the kernel) have replaced the __((packed))__ with
((packed)).  I get multiply defined symbol 'packed' in every source file
that includes that file.  Can anyone tell me what's going on.  What is gcc
trying to do, and why might it not be doing it.

I am using 2.8.1, but was having similar if not identical problems with
2.7.2.3.

TIA

geisel

I just looked at &lt;linux/genhd.h&gt; (2.0.36) and it has
__attributte((packed)) which I think is the right way to spell it in
unadorned c.  The partition struct was invented for the 8 bit pc, which
had no notion of word alignment, so that is trying to tell the compiler
not to insert slack bytes to make the words line up.  Since it is 8
unsigned char followed by 2 unsigned int, it does line up, but if you
look at a partition record you will see that the struct is misaligned
within the record.  Where did you get your kernel headers? :-)

Oh, tar -tbzf was a typo, of course, I meant tvzf.

I really don't have a problem deleting it, it doesn't change anything in my

Hi all,

Here is what I get when I try to compile cqcam and vic:

# ./configure
loading cache ./config.cache
checking host system type... i586-pc-linux-gnu
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... yes
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) is a cross-compiler... no
checking whether we are using GNU C... yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
checking for c++... no
checking for g++... no
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C++ compiler (gcc  ) works... no
configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C++ compiler
cannot create
executables.

It surprised me because I can compile the kernel without any problems.
But I don't understand
anything about C programming and compiling so it might be normal...
I've a RedHat 5.2 with kernel 2.2.6. Here are a few infos about my
system that might be
useful:
# gcc --version
egcs-2.91.66

libc-2.1.1.so

# ldd -v
ldd: version 1.9.9

libg++.so.2.7.2.8

moreover there is a directory named g++ in /usr/include with loads of .h
and .cc

Is there something I miss ??
Thanks for helping.

Hi,

I've made glibc 2.1.1 available at

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc
	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
	ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

(where XX is your country code).  The new files are

	glibc-2.1.1.tar.gz
	glibc-2.1-2.1.1.diff.gz
	glibc-2.1.1pre3-2.1.1.diff.gz		(not on ftp.gnu.org)
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.1.tar.gz

There is *no* new crypt add-on.  I hope the site containing the crypt
add-on packages will soon have an appropriate symlink.  For the time
being please simply use/download the 2.1 version of the add-on.

glibc 2.1.1 is a bug fix and maintenance release.  No significant new
features were added and the few problems reported are either fixed or
documented.  I consider glibc 2.1.1 very stable.

The main improvements from 2.1 beside bug fixes are:

- lots of speedups (especially in the dynamic linker)

- lots of SPARC and Linux/SPARC improvements

- RPC/XDR cleanups

- updates of many character set conversion functions

- several memory leaks are fixed


I'd like to thank (in no specific order) Andreas Schwab, Roland
McGrath, Andreas Jaeger, Jakub Jelinek, Thorsten Kukuk, Richard
Henderson, Zack Weinberg, Wolfram Gloger, Xavier Leroy, H.J. Lu, Mark
Kettenis, Philip Blundell, and David Miller for their constant
help and support.

Consider showing them your appreciation when you meet them the next
time.


A few more words to those who actually want to compile everything
themselves:

- do you really have to?  It's not easy and the tools must really work.
  We don't have the time to lead people through the process.

- did you remember using the -E option for patch?

- when something goes wrong, use a different compiler and or binutils.
  Chances are very good meanwhile that something is wrong at your side.

- did you read the FAQ?

I just dropped an include for genhd.h into a trivial program and it
compiles with no problem.  Works too.  hdformat, which needs hdreg.h, is
not at all troubled by also having genhddd.h included.  I didn't test
that, though.  I don't have a spare hd I want to play around with.  I am
pretty sure __attribute((packed)), __attribute((stdcall)), and
__attribute((cdecl)) are sacred to the compiler.  If they weren't nobody
could compile wine.  Well, there is some trouble on solaris with packed,
I think...  Say, do you have a variable or function named packed?  That
might confuse it.  Maybe you could change that one to packard or so? :-)
I could believe 2.7.2.3 giving parse error and 2.8 being more specific
for the same error.

&gt; struct partition { yada yada } __((packed))__;

The proper spelling is

 struct partition { yada yada; } __attribute__((packed));

The code you cite is not meaningful; either you didn't copy it
correctly from the kernel source, or somehow your kernel sources got
garbled.

Linas&gt; Hi,

Linas&gt; I haven't heard a peep about new versions of egcs or glibc 
Linas&gt; in many months.  A month ago, I dropped a patch for s/390
Linas&gt; egcs-1.1.2 and it echoed like a bottomless pit.  I have 
Linas&gt; a new improved patch ready ... I am concerned ... are the 
Linas&gt; maintainers overworked?

You're not reading linux-gcc, are you?  glibc 2.1.1pre2 has just been
released and is in release testing stage.  egcs 1.1.2 was released
some weeks ago.

Btw. the lists you addressed aren't involved with egcs development,
contact the egcs folks directly at &lt;http://egcs.cygnus.com&gt;.

Linas&gt; I also have a patch ready against glibc-2.1 for s/390.  Who 
Linas&gt; wants that?  Where do I send it to make it official?
libc-alpha@cygnus.com but it might be that you need to sign some
copyright papers before it can be applied.  Just send the patch.

Why are you insulting glibc and egcs developers?  With this attitude
you don't make yourself welcome and others might ignore you.

the crypt() function has moved to it's own lib. Use
"-lcrypt" to specify that you want to link against it.

Fabien,
	Ok, are you using C or C++ code, or are you using a mixture of the two? 
Is the message you're getting any more specific than that?  Did you look in
the unistd file and compare your function call?  How are you calling the
function (give us the line)?  Are you sure the line above it is ok (no
missing ; or something stupid, undefined variable whatever)?
	We're kinda short on information, I tried to give you some ideas to either
clue us in, or clue you in on the problem.  If this doesn't help at all,
let us know some more about what is going on.

You need to add -lcrypt when linking.  I think this is in the glibc FAQ.

Hi, Folks,

This is the beta release of gdb 4.17.0.12, which is based on gdb 4.17
plus Linux/x86 hardware watchpoint/FPU, glibc 2 pthread and Linux/PPC
support. You need linux 2.0.35 or above, or 2.1.xx to get the x86 FPU
to work correctly. The Linux/x86 binary works with all recent kernels
and C libraries, and the x86 FPU support is enabled at the run-time,
depending on the kernel version.

You need the latest glibc 2.1.1 to debug LinuxThreads.

Special thanks to Dan Bethe who provided the PowePC notebook which
makes the LinuxPPC support in gdb possible.

Please report any bugs related to gdb 4.17.0.12 to hjl@lucon.org.

Problems:

Because most of system calls in glibc 2 are written in assembly without
frame pointer, gdb may not be able to debug nor get stack trace system
calls on glibc-based 2 systems. Due to this, "make check" may fail in

FAIL: gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: backtrace through signal handler
FAIL: gdb.base/signals.exp: bt in signals.exp

with glibc 2.

Also, it is normal to see 

FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: continue (timeout)
FAIL: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: echo data (timeout)

if there is

XPASS: gdb.base/interrupt.exp: send_gdb end of file

Due to the new cplus-dem.c from egcs 1.1.1, you will get a few

FAIL: gdb.c++/demangle.exp: maint demangle __xxxxxxxxxx

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.11:

1. Support LinuxThreads on PowerPC.
2. Support P/III and AMD 3DNow! instructions.
3. Fix debugging dynamically loaded shared object.

Changes from gdb 4.17.0.10:

Read the file BUGS on how to report bugs.

This looks like you've got some files with length zero lying around.
Please always use patch -E or a newer patch version.  For now:
rm `find . -size 0` 
in your source directory and start with a fresh build in the separate
build directory.

Xavyer&gt; Apply patches:

Xavyer&gt; 	cd glibc-2.1
Xavyer&gt; 	patch -p1 &lt; ../glibc-2.1-2.1.1pre1.diff &gt; ../log.patch.1 2&gt;&amp;1
patch -p1 -E !
Xavyer&gt; 	patch -p1 &lt; ../glibc-2.1.1pre1-2.1.1pre2.diff &gt; ../log.patch.2 2&gt;&amp;1
likewise
Xavyer&gt; Check that the patches applied OK:

Xavyer&gt; 	less ../log.patch.[12]

Xavyer&gt; Read INSTALL:

Xavyer&gt; 	less INSTALL

Xavyer&gt; Prepare for build:

Xavyer&gt; 	On my first attempt, I issued the './configure ...' command shown
Xavyer&gt; 	below.	I received an error message indicating that it would
Xavyer&gt; 	be better to move the '/usr/include' directory out of the way.
Xavyer&gt; 	This seemed like a reasonable suggestion to me (at least not
Xavyer&gt; 	'un-reasonable'), so that is why I performed the next step.
The message is different, glibc will remove some files, you don't need 
to remove those yourself.
Xavyer&gt; 	su - root
Xavyer&gt; 	cd /usr
Xavyer&gt; 	mv include include.save
Xavyer&gt; 	mkdir include
Xavyer&gt; 	cd include
Xavyer&gt; 	ln -s ../src/linux/include/asm asm
Xavyer&gt; 	ln -s ../src/linux/include/linux linux
Xavyer&gt; 	exit

Xavyer&gt; Configure for build:

Xavyer&gt; 	mkdir glibc
Xavyer&gt; 	cd glibc
Xavyer&gt; 	../glibc-2.1/configure \
Xavyer&gt; 		--prefix=/usr \
Fine
Xavyer&gt; 		--host=i686-pc-linux-gnu \
Xavyer&gt; 		--build=i686-pc-linux-gnu \
Just i686-pc-linux-gnu is enough.
Xavyer&gt; 		--enable-add-ons

Xavyer&gt; 	(Yes, '--prefix=/usr' is probably not the smartest thing to
Xavyer&gt; 	do ... letting 'prefix' default to '/usr/local' yields the same
Xavyer&gt; 	error message)

hi

i've recently compiled gcc-2.8.1 but had to revert back to gcc-2.7.2.3.

the question i have now is that i am wishing to use the 
libstdc++-2.8.1 package and was wondering will the gcc-2.7.2.3 and more
specifically, the g++ compiler from that package, be suitable if i
compile and install the new libstdc++?

any help would be greatly appreciated.

rf&gt; sorry, just another note.
rf&gt; i know that the libstdc++ package documentation says that it should be
rf&gt; used with g++ 2.8.0 or greater, but since i am running libc5 on kernel
rf&gt; 2.0.35 and gcc 2.7.2.3 at the moment, is it possible to compile the gcc
rf&gt; 2.8.1 package but ONLY to install the g++ binary.

rf&gt; is that possible?
Probably.  It is certainly to have both gcc 2.7.2 and gcc 2.8.x installed.
I currently have: a.out, libc5 &amp; libc6 version of gcc 2.7.2 &amp; gcc 2.8.1

This works because gcc installs itself into /usr/lib/gcc-lib/machine-libc-type/version

The only tricky part is not getting the default gooffed.
But you can alway override the default version with -V2.7.2.3 or -V2.8.1

For C++ I would recommend egcs as it's support of C++ is more complete.

To get the defaults right for gcc &amp; g++ the important thing to save
the old /usr/bin/gcc (before the install) and put it back afterwards.

If you let g++ be the installed version it should default to 2.8.1

Hi,

I thought 2.1.1pre2 would be the last test release but I had to
implement one new feature and we got a number of bug reports.  So I've
made 2.1.1pre3.  The files

	glibc-2.1.1pre3.tar.gz			(or .bz2)
	glibc-2.1.1pre2-2.1.1pre3.diff.gz	(or .bz2)
	glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.1pre3.tar.gz	(or .bz2)

are now available at

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc
	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu
	ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

(where XX is your country code).


Beside fixing all critical bugs reported we've fixed many memory leaks
in the NIS+ code (you can now have programs running for a long time
though nisplus is in your nsswitch.conf file), two new functions
(getutmp, getutmpx) which are also available on Solaris, dynamic
string tokens are now also allowed in dlopen() parameters and
DT_NEEDED entries, LD_BIND_NOW now also influences dlopen() and a few
performance optimizations (yeah, even more).


Please give it a try and report back so that we finally can release 2.1.1.

Thanks,

Hi,

A P/3 bug is fixed.

-- 
H.J. Lu (hjl@gnu.org)
---
This should be final release for binutils 2.9.1.0.x based on binutils
2.9.1. I am planning to release to public this weekend. Please test it
as much as you can. Thanks.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.9.1.0.25 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 2.9.1 plus Linux/ARM support, some x86 assembler
changes, some PPC bug fixes, some alpha bug fixes and an exception
frame optimization bug fix.

Due to the exception frame optimization bug fix, it is highly
recommended that you recompile all your C++ codes. Otherwise,
exception handling may not work right when an exception is thrown.

Since I no longer have machine running libc 5, starting from this
release, there will be no pre-compiled binaries for libc 5.

There was some problem on Linux/alpha. The binaries generated by the
new binituls may not run correctly on Linux/alpha. It turned out it was
a bug in the alpha dynamic linker in glibc 2.0.6. The current glibc 2.1
and glibc 2.0.7 should be ok.

This release should work on linux/x86/alpha. There are some ELF bug
fixes. But I don't know if it fixes all the bugs reported on
linux/sparc, Linux/MIPS and linux/PPC. I'd like to hear reports on them.
I'd like to release it to public soon. Please test it as much as you
can.

fixed.

IMPORTANT:
The .plt format that the Alpha was using was not thread safe.  So I 
changed it.  The new format is *not* binary compatible with the old,
thus you must use glibc 2.0.4 to get an ld.so that can understand it.

Note that the new ld.so knows how to deal with the old .plt format, so
old libraries will still work, but they should be relinked eventually
for performance reasons.

The file list:

1. binutils-2.9.1.0.25.tar.gz. Source code.
2. binutils-2.9.1.0.24-2.9.1.0.25.diff.gz. Patch against the previous
   beta source code.
3. binutils-2.9.1.0.25-glibc.x86.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/x86 binaries
   for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above).
4. binutils-2.9.1.0.25-alpha.tar.gz. Precompiled Linux/alpha binaries
   for glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above.
5. binutils.spec. A RPM spec file for RedHat 5.2 and 6.x.

The primary ftp sites for the Linux binutils are:

1. ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils
2. ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc

The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.
 
To install the binary package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do
 
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.25-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
or
	gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.25-alpha.tar.gz | tar tvvf -
 
to see what is in there.
 
Please do back up before you remove things.

To install for libc 6 (glibc 2.0.7 1998-12-11 or above), PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. rm -f /usr/bin/encaps /usr/bin/nm
4. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.25-glibc.x86.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
5. ldconfig
 
Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin. You have to use
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/as
 
and
 
/usr/ix86-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux
 
if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.
 
To install for alpha, PLEASE DO
 
1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.9.1.0.25-alpha.tar.gz | tar xvvf -
4. ldconfig
 
I have changed the target names for Linux/x86 and Linux/x86 (a.out)
to ix86-linux and ix86-linuxaout respectively. The precompiled
binaries are installed under /usr/ix86-linux and /usr/ix86-linuxaout.
You should make appropriate symbolic links if you have a different
name for the Linux/x86 target, like i586-unknown-linux.

The target name for Linux/alpha is alpha-linux. The precompiled alpha
binaries are installed under /usr/alpha-linux. You should make
appropriate symbolic links if you have a different name for the
Linux/alpha target, like alpha-redhat-linux.

If you have an old linux library in the a.out format and you cannot
obtain the newer version in the ELF format for whatever reason, you
can try "objcopy --remove-leading-char" on the a.out library and see
if it can link with your code in ELF.

Thanks.

&gt; checking whether the C++ compiler (gcc  ) works... no
[...]
&gt; It surprised me because I can compile the kernel without any problems.

This is no surprise: A C++ compiler is not required for kernel
compilation. Please put the text

int main()
{}

into a file (say, hello.cc), and then compile it with

g++ -o hello hello.cc

if that gives you any error message, you probably need to install the
C++ compiler. If that works, you need to look at config.log to see
what the error was.

Martin

Thank you!

One nit:  http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html *still* says that
"the current version is 2.0" and still points to the 2.0 announcement
(/software/libc/ANNOUNCE-2.0.html).  This is kind of confusing.

Also, glibc-2.1.tar.gz never did reappear at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc/ .  There is *still* a glibc-2.1-README
from 11-Feb-1999 saying:

	glibc-2.1 has been (temporarily) removed, until some
	political issues are worked out.

Dear all,
     When I want to print some variable, sometimes gdb always told me "no 
such symbol", but I am sure it must have that symbol, and it have been
used, and it must be in current namespace. 
     I want to know if some else met this question and how to 
resolve it.

Sincerely Yours,

Dumb question:  between installing libraries and trying to use them, did
you run ldconfig?  Also, if you are going to run glibc from
/usr/local/lib, I think you want that in /etc/ld.so.conf.
/usr/lib/ld.linux.so.2 seems like an odd spelling and location.  IIRC if
you install glibc in /usr/local/lib, ld-linux.so.2 goes there too,
though it's just a symbolic link to the real ld-2.0.112.so or so.

Well, in case this might help. :-)

&gt; 	Hi, 
&gt; 
&gt; 	I tried to build glibc-2.0.122 and after about 2 hours of
compiling
&gt; 	time everything seemed to be ok. I compiled glibc with 2.2.1
kernel
&gt; 	header files, although my system is running kernel 2.0.30, and
installed
&gt; 	it in /usr/local. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Here is part of my configuration used to build glibc:
&gt; 
&gt; 	o egcs 1.1.1 (egc-2.91.60)
&gt; 	o binutils 2.9.1.0.25
&gt; 	o ld 1.9.9
&gt; 	o GNU Make 3.71.1
&gt; 	o libc 5.4.33
&gt; 
&gt; 	Now, when I'm trying to run the simpe foo.c program:
&gt; 
&gt; 	void main(void) {}
&gt; 
&gt; 	which is compiled as:
&gt; 
&gt; 	$ gcc foo.c -Wl,--dynamic-linker=/usr/lib/ld.linux.so.2 -o foo 
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm getting the following 'strange' msg:
&gt; 
&gt; 	$ ./foo
&gt; 	bash: ./foo: No such file or directory
&gt; 
&gt; 	I've also included /usr/local/lib in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env.
&gt; 	variable.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Also, when I try the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 	bash# nm -u foo
&gt; 	__mon_start__
&gt; 	__ibc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.0
&gt; 	_p_hw
&gt; 	abort@@GLIBC_2.0
&gt; 	free@@GLIBC_2.0
&gt; 	malloc@@GLIBC_2.0
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; 	If I'm asking in the wrong place I would appreciate u pointing
me
&gt; 	to the appropriate one. TIA. :-)

        ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/software/libs/glibc

(where XX is your country code).  It soon will also be available on

        ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libc

There you will find the files

        glibc-2.1.2pre3.tar.gz
        glibc-linuxthreads-2.1.2pre3.tar.gz

and possibly .bz2 versions.  There is no new crypt add-on, still use
the version released with glibc 2.1.


Since 2.1.2pre2 we've added lots of changes, especially a number of
patches went in which correct problems with threads.  If no problems
are reported I'll make a final 2.1.2 release soon.


So, now is your chance to avoid releasing a buggy version.  The
feedback I got for the last prereleases was lousy at best.  It might
even be that this version does not even compile on some platforms.


I only have easy access to an x86 and Arm machine (well, there is the
HP but HPPA/Linux does not yet work).  So you have to do the tests for
other platforms yourself or put one of the machines you care about
under my desk.

So, test this version and send feedback to
