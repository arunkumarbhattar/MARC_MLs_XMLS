Hi all, 

I hope my topic is appropriate for this list, if not please point me 
in the right direction. 

I know the thing I want to achieve is strange as I could do the same 
better by using the dynamic module loader.  Unfortunately I've got to 
port an application from another OS and I'm currently not able to 
change the inner workings too much. 

What I want to achieve is to dynamically access arbitrary variables in 
my kernel module by determining the offset of the variable's address 
offline as an offest regarding a common base address within my 
module.  To achieve that I need to know the following: 

1. How many segments does a kernel module binary usually have? Is it 
   the same as in userland, i.e. .bss, .data and .text? Or are there 
   others or only a single one? 

2. (How) can I instruct the linker to put a certain variable 'near' 
   the beginning of each segment? This would become my base address, 
   one for each segment.  I would use the dynamic loader to access 
   this base address at runtime.  The most important prerequisite 
   would be that this base address needs to be 'in front of' every 
   application variable. 

3. I want to use binutils/nm to compute the offset of my application 
   variables in terms of their distance to the relevant base address. 
   This can obviously change from revision to revision of my my 
   module, which is ok.  Is that viable (I don't know the dynamic 
   linker of the kernel)? 

4. At runtime I want to compute my application variable's address by: 

   real_adr = base address + offset 

   Is that also ok? 


TIA, 

Andreas Ames

Dear All,

I have written a small thread program in C using the pthreads. I am able
to set the threads priority with pthread_setschedparam API when I login
as ROOT. If I login as a normal user other than ROOT, then the API
returns the error number 1 (EPERM). 

Please let me know whether a normal user can set the pthreads priority
with pthread_setschedparam API or not.

Here is the sample code for testing.

/* 
 * Creates two threads, one printing 10 "a"s, 
 * the other printing 10 "b"s.
 * Illustrates: thread creation, thread joining. 
 */

#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include "pthread.h"
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;

void * process(void * arg)
{
  int i;
  fprintf(stderr, "Starting process %s\n", (char *) arg);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    write(1, (char *) arg, 1);
  }
  fprintf(stderr,"\n");

  return NULL;
}

int main()
{
  int retcode;
  pthread_t th_a, th_b;
  void * retval;
  struct sched_param sp;
  int esnRetVal = 0;
  pthread_attr_t attr;

  pthread_attr_init(&amp;attr);
  pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&amp;attr, PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED);
 
  retcode = pthread_create(&amp;th_a, &amp;attr, process, "a");
  if (retcode != 0) fprintf(stderr, "create a failed %d\n", retcode);

  sp.sched_priority = 30;
  esnRetVal = pthread_setschedparam(th_a, SCHED_RR, &amp;sp);
  if(esnRetVal != 0)
  {
     printf("Failed to set the pthread sched param! esnRetVal = %d errno
= %d\n", esnRetVal, errno);
     return -1;
  } 

  retcode = pthread_create(&amp;th_b, NULL, process, "b");
  if (retcode != 0) fprintf(stderr, "create b failed %d\n", retcode);

  retcode = pthread_join(th_a, &amp;retval);
  if (retcode != 0) fprintf(stderr, "join a failed %d\n", retcode);

  retcode = pthread_join(th_b, &amp;retval);
  if (retcode != 0) fprintf(stderr, "join b failed %d\n", retcode);

  return 0;
}

Thanks in advance.

I guess you should ask your lawyer, for a precise answer.
Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License, it is pretty

Dear All,

I have written an application where I used a few ASM statements in it.
The statements are very simple and they look like as shown below.

asm
(
	"next:\n\t"
#ifdef __x86_64__
	"pop %rax\n\t"
	"pop %rcx"		
#else
	"popl %eax\n\t"
	"popl %ecx"		
#endif
);

asm
(
	"xorl %eax, %eax\n\t"
	"cpuid\n\t"
	"cmpl $4, %eax\n\t" 	// check if cpuid supports leaf 4
	"jl .single_core\n\t"	// Single core
	"movl $4, %eax\n\t"	
	"movl $0, %ecx\n\t"	// start with index = 0; Leaf 4 reports
);					// at least one valid cache
level
asm
(
	"cpuid"
	: "=a" (Regeax)
	:
	: "%ebx", "%ecx", "%edx"
);		
asm
(
	"jmp .multi_core\n"
	".single_core:\n\t"
	"xor %eax, %eax\n"
	".multi_core:"
);

I am able to compile the application in optimization level 2 (-O2) where
as when I specify the optimization level (-O3) I end up with the
following errors.

{standard input}: Assembler messages:

I have searched the google and did not find any solution. However, I
have gone through the following link and there is no much luck to me.

http://lists.atrpms.net/pipermail/atrpms-users/2005-July/003451.html

One thing, I can mention here is, I did update the packages through YUM
command only. The system configuration is as follows.

1) DELL 64 Bit - Pentium(R) D CPU 3.00 GHz
2) 1 GB RAM
3) Linux - CENTOS - 5.2 with default kernel version - 2.6.18-92.el5
4) gcc version 4.1.2 20071124

Please suggest me a solution to getridof from the above errors.

Thanks in advance.

Hi All,

Are there any known bugs with pread/pwrite on RHEL Linux when the disk partition is \
close to full?

Reduced a complex application fatal down to a simple program just opens a regular \
file and performs 1M sequential pwrite() of size 8KB blocks; at every 100th write, \
does a pread() to load the very first 8KB block and validate its content still \
matching what was originally written.

What I observed are the following when running on different machines and \
writing/reading to a disk partition nearly full with slightly more than 1GB of free \
space according to 'df' (the program is the only process accessing the disk) -

* Linux 2.6.9-55.ELsmp #1 SMP Fri Apr 20 16:36:54 EDT 2007 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 \
GNU/Linux  (RHEL4)

BEHAVIOR: pwrite() works for many iterations, then pread() suddenly returns data of \
the requested size but filled with 0's, and strerror shows errno="No such file or \
directory", condition  if(size_to_read != pread(fd, buf, size_to_read, ...)) ...
is not triggered and application has to check errno immediately after every call to \
pread.

CONCLUSION: serious bug, why does pread() return the expected size filled with 0? and \
why doesn't pwrite() fail earlier so application has a chance to bail out and stop \
pushing more data to the file?

* Linux 2.6.18-8.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jan 26 14:15:14 EST 2007 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 \
GNU/Linux (RHEL5)

BEHAVIOR: pwrite() works for much fewer iterations, then pread() errors out again \
with errno="No such file or directory", and condition (size_to_read!=pread(...)) is \
asserted at the meantime, which is slightly better but application still very hard to \
recover.

CONCLUSION: Bug, still, pwrite() should error out earlier if not enough space to \
commit data, instead of fail on pread() as it's often catastrophic for application to \
handle.

Interestingly, with Suse Linux Enterprise which has an older kernel version, the \
behavior seems much more defensive and sane

* Linux 2.6.5-7.244-smp #1 SMP Mon Dec 12 18:32:25 UTC 2005 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 \
GNU/Linux

BEHAVIOR: pwrite() works for a few iterations and errors out with errno="Disk quota \
exceeded" before pread() fails, application easily traps and handles without data \
lose.


Any pointers either to any known bugs or anything I might be missing are highly \
appreciated!

Thanks
Qiuyang

Dear All,

The label redefinition in inline ASM was fixed. The actual error is due
to the function was called more  than 3 times and in every place the
code was replaced. So, it was showed the redefinition error. However, by
looking at the following paragraph and links, I have fixed the error.

GCC allows (and requires) you to specify register constraints in your
inline assembly code, so the optimizer always know about it; thus,
inline assembly code is really made of patterns, not forcibly exact
code.

Thus, you can put your assembly into CPP macros, and inline C functions,
so anyone can use it in as any C function/macro. Inline functions
resemble macros very much, but are sometimes cleaner to use. Beware that
in all those cases, code will be duplicated, so only local labels (of 1:
style) should be defined in that asm code. However, a macro would allow
the name for a non local defined label to be passed as a parameter (or
else, you should use additional meta-programming methods). Also, note
that propagating inline asm code will spread potential bugs in them; so
watch out doubly for register constraints in such inline asm code.

Dear All,

I have implemented a threading program using the pthread library on CentOS - 5.2 \
Linux system. (The CentOS is an Enterprise Linux distribution based on the freely \
available sources from Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) However, I need to create a pthread \
that is initially suspended. But, I did not find any API in the pthread library which \
does the my requirement. So, I googled and found some of the FreeBSD thread API which \
is as follows.

pthread_attr_setcreatesuspend_np
pthread_suspend_np
pthread_resume_np 

pthread_attr_setcreatesuspend_np  - prepare attribute for creation of suspended \
thread. I have also seen that the "_np" stands for "non portable" API. (The functions \
with the pthread_ prefix and _np suffix are not portable extensions to POSIX \
threads.)

My question is, how can I use the "_np" API on my Linux box. I guess, the "_np" API \
is available in "libthr" shared library. So, I tried to download the "libthr" shared \
library, but there is no luck to me. 

I have also one more question, Shall I use the "libthr" shared library on my CENTOS \
without affecting the "libpthread" library. If possible, please suggest me.

I can also able to implement the suspend and resume functionality with the following \
mechanism. But I have also seen that with "libthr" we get better performance than \
"libpthread". Please look at the following link. That is the reason, I want to use \
the "libthr" on my CENTOS Linux box.

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19082719-FreeBSD-libthr-libpthread

static int ready_to_go = 0;
static pthread_mutex_t suspend_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
static pthread_cond_t suspend_cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

static void *func(void *arg) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;suspend_mutex);
        while (ready_to_go == 0) {
               pthread_cond_wait(&amp;suspend_cond, &amp;suspend_mutex);
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;suspend_mutex);
        /* Now do our thing */
        ...
        return NULL;
}

void spawn_thread(void) {
        pthread_attr_t attr;
        pthread_t thread;

        pthread_attr_init(&amp;attr);
        /* We don't need to join this thread */
        pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&amp;attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);
        pthread_create(&amp;thread, &amp;attr, func, NULL);
        pthread_attr_destroy(&amp;attr);

        /* Do some stuff */
        ...
        /* Now tell thread to continue */
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;suspend_mutex);
        ready_to_go = 1;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;suspend_mutex);
        pthread_cond_signal(&amp;suspend_cond);
}

Thanks in advance.

Dear All,

I have written an application where I have used the libpthread library
for creating the pthreads. However, to get the maximum optimization, I
want to use the libthr.a library instead of libpthread library. However,
when I tried to use on my Redhat box, I end up with following errors.

../lib/linux/libthr.a(thr_sem.o): In function `_sem_init':
thr_sem.c:(.text+0x100): undefined reference to `ksem_init'

../lib/linux/libthr.a(thr_sem.o): In function `_sem_wait':
....
....
....

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [target] Error 1

I understand that the "ksem_init" is not available on the Redhat box.
Then, I have tried to use the libc.so.7 from FreeBSD. I have included
the libc.so.7 in my application to getridof the above undefined
references. Even though, I end up with the following errors.

/usr/bin/ld: errno@@FBSD_1.0: TLS definition in /lib/libc.so.6 section 
.tbss mismatches non-TLS definition in ../lib/linux/libc.so section 
.bss
/lib/libc.so.6: could not read symbols: Bad value

Here, the lib/libc.so.6 is a Redhat libc library where as 
../lib/linux/libc.so is a FreeBSD library (libc.so.7). 

Is it possible to use the FreeBSD libthr.a library file on a Redhat
Linux box? 

Please let me know the whether it is possible to use the libthr.a
library on Redhat box or not.

Thanks in advance.

Dear All,

I have written an application where I used a few ASM statements in it.
The statements are very simple and they look like as shown below.

	asm
	(
		"next:\n\t"
#ifdef __x86_64__
		"pop %rax\n\t"
		"pop %rcx"		
#else
		"popl %eax\n\t"
		"popl %ecx"		
#endif
	);

      asm
	(
		"xorl %eax, %eax\n\t"
		"cpuid\n\t"
		"cmpl $4, %eax\n\t"		// check if cpuid
supports leaf 4
		"jl .single_core\n\t"		// Single core
		"movl $4, %eax\n\t"		
		"movl $0, %ecx\n\t"		// start with index = 0;
Leaf 4 reports
	);						// at least one
valid cache level
	asm
	(
		"cpuid"
		: "=a" (Regeax)
		:
		: "%ebx", "%ecx", "%edx"
	);		
	asm
	(
		"jmp .multi_core\n"
		".single_core:\n\t"
		"xor %eax, %eax\n"
		".multi_core:"
	);

I am able to compile the application in optimization level 2 (-O2) where
as when I specify the optimization level (-O3) I end up with the
following errors.

{standard input}: Assembler messages:

I have searched the google and did not find any solution. However, I
have gone through the following link and there is no much luck to me.

http://lists.atrpms.net/pipermail/atrpms-users/2005-July/003451.html

One thing, I can mention here is, I did update the packages through YUM
command only. The system configuration is as follows.

1) DELL 64 Bit - Pentium(R) D CPU 3.00 GHz
2) 1 GB RAM
3) Linux - CENTOS - 5.2 with default kernel version - 2.6.18-92.el5
4) gcc version 4.1.2 20071124

Please suggest me a solution to getridof from the above errors.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks and Regards,
Srinivas G
