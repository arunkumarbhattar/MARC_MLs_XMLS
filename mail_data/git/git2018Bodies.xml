&gt; This happens *only* if the other developers also have somefile mentioned
&gt; in their .gitignore.

It will be mentioned, because of I can add/push, wait developers pull,  add/push

I can do this because I was angry or was fired. So this is my last "surprise" for \
others ))

&gt; &gt; EXPECTED: git should warn about that content will be replaced and do not \
&gt; &gt; pull/checkout until we force pull/checkout
&gt; 
&gt; If somefile is *not* mentioned in their .gitignore, the file is not
&gt; removed and there is a warning.

As you can see the file is not just ignored in my case it is important because added \
to the repo


we can think of some sort of default configuration stored in repo. 
But added to ignore file because developers do not want to track local changes
(every developer has own options when configure local instance of application)

it *this very important* to not lose these options while switching between branches \
or pull from remote.

And I do not expect and do not want to get such "surprises" from anyone

Hi,

[I know, blast from the past...]

&gt; &gt; One of our users has just reported that:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $ git remote rename origin origin2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; will turn following remote entry:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [remote "origin"]
&gt; &gt; 	url = c:\\repo\\
&gt; &gt; 	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; into following entry for which the url is skipped:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [remote "origin2"]
&gt; &gt; [remote "origin2"]
&gt; &gt; 	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin2/*
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I understand that this is caused by the trailing \\ and it's easy to
&gt; &gt; fix, but 'git push' and 'git pull' work properly with such URLs and a
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $ git clone c:\repo\
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; will even result in the problematic remote-entry. So I guess some kind
&gt; &gt; of validation could be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; If you change the original definition of the "origin" to
&gt; 
&gt;         [remote "origin"]
&gt;                url = "c:\\repo\\"
&gt;                fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
&gt; 
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt;         [remote "origin"]
&gt;                url = c:\\repo\\ # ends with bs
&gt;                fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
&gt; 
&gt; it seems to give me a better result.  I didn't dig to determine
&gt; where things go wrong in "remote rename", and it is possible that
&gt; the problem is isolated to that command, or the same problem exists
&gt; with any value that ends with a backslash.  If the latter, "git clone"
&gt; and anything that writes to configuration such a value needs to be
&gt; taught about this glitch and learn a workaround, I would think.
&gt; 
&gt; Dscho Cc'ed, not for Windows expertise, but as somebody who has done
&gt; a lot in &lt;config.c&gt;.

So... I finally had a look at this, and while I agree that the quoted
version is better, I also agree that the backslash is mistaken for a
continuation character (which is not even allowed in section headers).

A quick test with my `empty-config-section` patch series shows that it
addresses this issue. A quick bisec confirms that the patch with the
online "git_config_set: make use of the config parser's event stream" is
responsible for this fix.

At first, I was puzzled by this, because I expected `git remote rename` to
be backed by the `git_config_copy_or_rename_section_in_file()` function
(which my patch series does not touch).

But then I looked at the code of the `mv()` function in builtin/remote.c
and it uses `git_config_set_multivar()` and `git_config_set()`. And those
functions were indeed touched (and fixed) by above-mentioned commit.

Ciao,
Johannes

I played around with this test data:

        [sec "tio"]
                val = a\\
                ue = b

and saw "git config --rename-section sec.tio sec.tion" just work
fine (without the event stream change).  Without the event stream
change, "git config --unset sec.tio.ue" loses "sec.tio.val" but with
it we see we only lose the last line, which is the correct thing to
happen.

Nice.
