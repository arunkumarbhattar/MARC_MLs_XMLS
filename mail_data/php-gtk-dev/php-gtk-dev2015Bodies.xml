PHP-Gtk2 app, using php5.2 compile and IonCube encryption.

We recently tried to upgrade all our users to Win7 and a MariaDB
Server.  Most offices are okay, but the largest one is seeing a lot of
CLI errors from PHP, with forced shutdowns of the app.

Has anybody seen anything similar?

thanks,
Madeleine D.

Luiz,
Good afternoon,
In programming there is no impossible.
The limitations of a programming language are outdated over time.
So everything depends on the programmer's creativity.
Was said to be impossible to run php client side as a desktop ... then 
the php-gtk emerged.
If I understand what you want: a window manager style: KDE, GNOME ...
It will not be easy ... But I will not say it's impossible.
I advise you to open a project, for example, on github.
This will help you find people willing to believe in your window manager.
And its development will be faster.
Thank You

Translate for portuguese Brazil.

Luiz,
Boa tarde,
Em programação não existe o impossível.
As limitações de uma linguagem de programação são ultrapassadas com o tempo.
Então tudo depende da  criatividade do programador.
Diziam ser impossível o php rodar do lado cliente como um desktop... 
então surgiu o php-gtk.
Se entendi o que você quer: um gerenciador de janelas ao estilo: KDE, 
GNOME...
Não será tarefa fácil... Mas não direi que é impossível.
Aconselho a abrir um projeto, por exemplo, no github.
Isto irá ajudá-lo a encontrar pessoa dispostas a acreditar no seu 
gerenciador de janelas.
E seu desenvolvimento será mais rápido.
Obrigado

He's back and he's going to continue where he left off before, when I can I'm gonna \
help him partially to learn about the innards of this project and how to rewrite \
something from scratch among other reasons. All in all, the outcome should be \
interesting. Kudos to Alexandre (I'll be back to help in a couple of weeks after \
family vacation is over).

What karma is needed for project site maintenance and what are the requirements for \
that karma in particular? That's where I will be fully useful, but I will partially \
be able to learn the rest (I may need Alexandre to assign me to certain parts of \
programming, as I've said I'm new but I have php skills and a set of basic C/C++ \
skills.)

I want site maintenance so that I can retheme the site to look like a blue version of \
PHP.net as well as contribute to documenting what Alexandre, myself and others have \
currently added in the code. I myself look at this as an opportunity to learn how \
language bindings work by helping to develop one.

Hello Gage, sorry for delay to answer you, first for my personal issues,
second for my bad english

​For years I have see​n very enthusiasts people, who never seen c/c++
sources and with alot of pression to do the project. So I decided to create
my own repo on github, and make some tests

My tests are not definitively, and has alot of things to think about.
Structures, generators, people to code, and alot other things

I have created this repo about a year ago, and nobody contribute with one
line of code, and think about all php-gtk structure alone can be hard

I think you can see how disappointed I am, but my tests will continue, on
my time, but will continue

Thank you, and whisp me for ANYTHING you need

Hey Bruno, is it just tests or is it close to a finished product? Shoot me a link to your repo and I'll check it out. Thanks for the support.

Is it possible to add temporary support to PHP-GTK2 for GTK3? I realize that a new project needs to be started for a full, bug free experience, but I'm just wondering (I realize patches are normally used for bugs) where I can go with this.

You can compile php-gtk2 on any linux. You can use gtk2 lib yet. Works fine

My repo is only alot of tests: test to do without generators, test of
structure. I think my structure are to much hard to do, but alot more
flexible

github _DOT_ com/scorninpc/php-gtk3-tests
​

Thanks'

Here in about a week I'll be out in the middle of the Carribean without Internet on a \
cruise ship, so I'm just putting that out there. As for the extreme amount of \
activity, that probably happened as soon as I got here, as the first person to \
respond was Madeleine, and it went downhill when I started to "bug" the devs - pun \
intended. I don't mean to be most of the time, but I end up a walking, talking \
controversy for only God knows what reason. 

After I arrived, I saw a lot of people show up I hadn't seen before, particularly \
Bruno and Alexandre. I needed this for a project being worked on by myself and my \
friend, Elijah. So I was persistant and people showed up. 

As for the website, does anyone here think a wiki would fit? Anyways, I partially \
want to retheme the website because this one still uses the legacy theme. So, I \
started with the mailing list first because I tried IRC and it was like radio silence \
out there. I just thought this looked like a good place to kickstart, and now look, \
people!

Anyways, I appreciate the support I've been able to find here, because most \
communities would rather argue with me for some reason or other, and that rant I just \
went on (sorry about that, but bureaucracies do happen to piss me off) was one hing \
that draws negative attention. If it's to the point past that I usually just leave, \
but this community is starting to dig itself back out of its grave that an assumption \
made people think it was in. And then that assumption that it was dead put it \
underground for some time, although it never died officially. Now we're kickstarting, \
and I cannot wait for about halfway into July, because that's possibly the best time \
to start trying for karma (I'm writing on an iPad right now) because I'm on vacation \
with one side of my family but in about a week I'll be heading out to Puerto Rico to \
board a cruise ship and I'm a bit sad Internet is like $0.50 a minute. I can do some \
of the basic stuff, but you know it's an iPad, and sometimes carrying a laptop around \
with you if not at a developer conference or similar event can be a risk. I've taken \
it to WordCamp, but I'm in a cabin in the woods for about a week. Then there's the \
TSA that we have to worry about, and my trust with them is low due to past experience \
(go study up on some regulations etc., before flight because there may be fight \
beforehand, they are kinda snoopy) and a $500 laptop that works great for $500. I \
would take it but I have other developer projeccts on there that I don't want someone \
else to have, and it's running on Ubuntu, which is Linux on physical hardware, and if \
you know anything about that, you can do bad things with access to the physical \
hardware. 

So, having said that, I'm gonna try to get karma in about two to two and a half \
weeks, it may toward the middle of next month. Thanks guys, this is why I've stayed. \
;)

A re-theme would be great!

I don't think we should look to host a wiki on the PHP.net servers, though.
Anything that requires database access or filesystem access (storing files
to disk to serve as a database) can be problematic for portability and
security reasons. We used to have a wiki, for example, and it got clogged
up with spam, so the wiki was taken down.

Maybe we could turn on the wiki for the GitHub repo and use that instead?

Other than my reservations about storage on the server, I fully support
website redesign efforts, and I'll help where I can.

Hello, Good Evening Ben,

I just read this message because earlier today I was busy. I will say that that \
happens to be the first point of interest for me, but I am also interested in the \
code. But I want toet the website in sync with today, not last decade, as I told \
Elizabeth on IRC earlier today. 

I happen to have a website (though it's kind of stuck right now) was meant to be a \
social network but I kind of just quit after I got bored - most projects end up \
finished. 

I will say that as soon as I get the chance, I want to use a similar light blue and \
dark blue scheme as exhibited on this site, though it may need to be a bit lighter to \
match aesthetically with the theme. 

Also, general question here, is it time to mark PHP-GTK 1 and 2 as archived, due to \
their age? And more importantly, is it time to stop using DocBook and XSL and \
actually write it ourselves? Just some food for thought, because this is what some \
say is difficult, but honestly, when the first release is made for PHP-GTK3, wouldn't \
it make sense to write documentation specific to the new one? I realize PHP-GTK3 \
works fine, but if you want Glade and other things, you're pretty much SOL. Just \
wanting some feedback because this is probably one of the most important part for \
people other than the software itself. We need documentation and tutorials, which \
partially helped me until "Hello Glade." Anyways, is it just me, or is it when I came \
barreling in here, did everyone else just follow? LOL ;) Not a bad thing for a \
project that needs people to join!

So it's not a great idea to do a wiki because that was tried in the past...Got it. So \
what I wanna do is get that website up and with a new face. People coming by this \
website have several issues I can name in this post. 

Table of Contents:
1. Readability
1.1. Front Page Readability
1.2. Headings
1.3. ARIA
1.4. Sidebars

2. Aesthetics
2.1. First Impression
2.2. Modern, LIVING

3. Documentation

1) Readability: How People View the Content Itself
Covering the issues on the site involving content layout.

1.1) Front Page Readability: 
This is certainly an issue given the mess of a front page we're stuck with right now. \
If we switch to what php.net uses, it will be much easier to tell what should be \
considered as details, main text, etc. I'm sure Alexandre, who is usually the man up \
front with posting, will appreciate these aesthetics, as they will space things out a \
bit and people will be able to tell with less clutter what is translated as \
Portuguese and what is translated as English. (As a side note, I'm wondering as to \
whether or not Portuguese is the same in all countries, because even English isn't \
the same in other countries, but it's different compared to other languages. Usually \
just a misplaced 's' if you're American). 

1.2) Headings 
Headings currently add to the clutter, which when, in Alexandre's case, is not his \
issue, but the layout of whatever or however the webpage is rendered. I'm considering \
this a CSS/theming issue rather than a misplaced &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; tag, which gets themed \
by either CSS or in CMS and blogs, the theme used. This theme is last century and \
generally ancient when it comes to Internet years; anything as far back as 2011 can \
be considered ancient just because even if it ain't broke, the Internet likes to fix \
the problems of consumers. Advances on the Internet are made quickly, and whether \
other devs outside of here like it or not, PHP is a monolithic beast, but it's not \
going anywhere. So, by fixing this issue by replacing themes, Alexandre's posts will \
become hella readable compared to what they are now. 

1.3) ARIA
This is accessibility, and is an issue on the PHP-GTK website that is one of the many \
beasts out there that I'm pretty sure is one of the beasts slain by the new php.net \
theme, assuming it follows HTML5 standards. This means any headings will be \
recognized by screen readers in the right order and will comply with ARIA standards \
(despite my own visual impairment, though not completely blind, is something I don't \
know anything about whatsoever).

1.4) Sidebars
I'm pretty sure with the current php.net, you can ease the clutter with just one \
sidebar, whereas this looks like Drupal Garland hell. I'm pretty sure I haven't used \
two sidebars at all since I've been making websites as far back as my noob days as a \
third grader without any prior knowledge of programming other than HTML. 

1.5) Uggghhhh-ly Font
Again something solved in the wake of the new php.net.

2) Aesthetics 
How people see us in the era of the Internet as it stands.

2.1) First Impression
I have noticed this when I visited the site in the past, before I showed up recently. \
to be honest, I didn't know it was "dead." I'm probably going to be sarcastic to \
others out there about that when I'm out in the wild/external sites asking for help \
and people all of a sudden go silent and say "What?" This is one of the biggest \
reasons I want to do this to the PHP-GTK website. I want to do this to clarify the \
fact that just because you cannot judge a book by it's cover, you CAN judge a website \
by IT's design, look at Facebook. One button moved and it's like a total war breaks \
out. We need to remove the '90s stereotype because honest to God my OCD is killing me \
(yes, a medical condition, people need to stop using it as an excuse) and it's \
because I can still see those gray lines. I have a similar issue with the way reddit \
is designed. 

2.2) Modern, LIVING
We are currently standing with most as a "dead" community. People who said we were \
dead are going to come here and think that just yesterday we were a living, breathing \
1990's website, which we're the exact opposite. So that definitely will send a ripple \
for anyone who visits. Also, someone should check the Wikipedia page; it's \
hysterical. 

3) Documentation
This part I need you guys to decide for me, because a wiki is definitely out of the \
question after the last ordeal. I also don't want to have to just be like, "Okay, \
this is what we're doing!" on this one in particular, because it is, I believe, the \
second biggest thing other than the project's code itself. So, I can revise this \
section once you decide how we'll clean the docs relating to PHP-GTK. 

Again, it might not be the most important part of the project, but it should and \
needs to be done, and I can very easily get that accomplished given time (scheduling, \
man, it sucks). But, hey, I think we're finally going somewhere with this.

&gt; Hey, good afternoon, Ben:

&gt; I've updated the README with two different Linux methods for installation
&gt; of PHP-GTK2: One for those who want a dedicated PHP install, or those who
&gt; would rather apply a patch and move on. Despite Ubuntu-specific, on other
&gt; Linux systems the commands would either be the same or they would be only
&gt; slightly different.

&gt; I created a patch with diff:
&gt;

Gage,

Thanks for the README patch. I have a couple recommendations for changes:

You mention that Cairo should be checked out using Subversion. However, the
Subversion repository listed is old and no longer maintained. Cairo's main
repository is now on GitHub, so your instructions should be updated to
clone from the Git repository instead. The Cairo PECL extension source is
now located here: https://github.com/gtkforphp/cairo

Likewise, you mention checking out the php-gtk source from a Subversion
repository. This repository no longer exists and has been migrated to Git.
Please update your instructions to show cloning from the Git repository.
The primary upstream repository URL is
https://git.php.net/repository/php/gtk-src.git (see also
http://git.php.net/?p=php/gtk-src.git;a=summary), but you may also chose to
use the GitHub URL for convenience: https://github.com/php/php-gtk-src.
I'll leave that up to you.

What does the SquirrelsHatesRobots patch do for php-gtk2? You need to make
it clear why you're suggesting the use of the SquirrelsHatesRobots patch; I
would prefer not to advocate the use of a third-party patch in the main
project README, unless it's absolutely necessary. Is this a patch that
should be merged into the primary project repository? It looks like it's a
single line addition to build2/build2.mk.

Cheers,
Ben

Can you explain the problem the SquirrelsHatesRobots patch solves? Why is
it Ubuntu-specific?

Thanks,
Ben

Glade2 support is long past due, and I have no clue how to get it in
there. I am new here, and I am having troubles. I can install it on
Ubuntu, but glade3 particularly and some of the others located in /ext
aren't showing up. I have no clue how to develop for this project, so

Good Afternoon Madeleine,

What you happen to be using is GTK2, which was replaced years ago. Although some may \
say that GTK3 is relatively new, that would be what I'd assume was due to its role in \
the controversial GNOME3 development. Timeframes for these two I currently don't have \
on me. 

Even worse, Glade3 has been out since August 12. 2006. So even though Glade 3.8 can \
be used with GTK2, I can't find a package for GTK2. Essentially, even the docs on \
gtk.php.net need an overhaul, which I would have a hard time writing because I can't \
even fully utilize PHP-GTK yet. 

What I'm looking into is using PHP-GTK with GTK3 and Glade3.(19?). I read the \
archives and it was said something was in the works, but it doesn't look like \
anything has come to fruition yet. 

Because GTK2 isn't even available anymore, and  PHP-GTK thus won't build for Glade \
even if it finds support, PHP-GTK needs to be "overhauled" for both packages (Glade3 \
and GTK3), something of which I have no idea how to do. I emailed Andrei directly \
about helping out, but he seems to not have been in his inbox for a while. 

Also, Windows for some odd reason has both Glade3 and GTK3 for PHP-GTK, but right now \
neither are built-in for Linux. I use Ubuntu and without these, PHP-GTK will stand a \
sitting duck. It's not dead, there's just not enough people. If whoever over here is \
still planning PHP-GTK3 that was mentioning it in January, please post an update on \
the fact that you are indeed working on a 3rd update or planning a 3rd update to the \
main page at gtk.php.net. I realize there have been some posts to an extent on \
gtk.php.net, but none seem to say anything about what the actual development \
happening right now is, just that "it's still happening."

Also, in order to attract more people, there needs to be some "uniformization" with \
the website itself. The gtk.php.net will officially be pronounced a living project \
again when the website can make a PHP-GTK blue theme that goes along with the main \
site's theme at php.net. The current site looks like what php.net used to look like, \
but not what the actual php.net looks like anymore. If we can make PHP-GTK's website \
look like a blue version on par with php.net's current purple version, then the \
people come are gonna be like "When did this happen? Just yesterday it looked \
outdated!!"

Even though the saying goes "Don't judge a book by it's cover," people will always \
end up doing just that. So, who in this project has been working on PHP-GTK3? 

(If there are any corrections to what I just said about Glade and GTK, don't mention \
them here because I will likely figure them out as time goes on, all I'm requesting \
is that somebody puts it out there that PHP-GTK3 is in fact underway and what the \
game plan is, even if incomplete)

Are you saying I should go over to IRC? I did look at the resources page, and I did \
see links to programs made with PHP-GTK, but I'm talking about PHP-GTK itself. Also, \
the site itself needs a design upgrade to match up as a blue version of php.net. \
Anyone visiting will see what gtk.php.net looks like now and think that it is \
slightly outdated. I will go rescan the Resources page.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you happen to be using is GTK2, which was replaced years ago. Although \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some may say that GTK3 is relatively new, that would be what I'd assume was \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; due to its role in the controversial GNOME3 development. Timeframes for \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these two I currently don't have on me.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even worse, Glade3 has been out since August 12. 2006. So even though Glade \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.8 can be used with GTK2, I can't find a package for GTK2. Essentially, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even the docs on gtk.php.net need an overhaul, which I would have a hard \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time writing because I can't even fully utilize PHP-GTK yet.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I'm looking into is using PHP-GTK with GTK3 and Glade3.(19?). I read \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the archives and it was said something was in the works, but it doesn't \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look like anything has come to fruition yet.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because GTK2 isn't even available anymore, and  PHP-GTK thus won't build \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for Glade even if it finds support, PHP-GTK needs to be "overhauled" for \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both packages (Glade3 and GTK3), something of which I have no idea how to \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I emailed Andrei directly about helping out, but he seems to not have \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been in his inbox for a while.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, Windows for some odd reason has both Glade3 and GTK3 for PHP-GTK, but \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right now neither are built-in for Linux. I use Ubuntu and without these, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK will stand a sitting duck. It's not dead, there's just not enough \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people. If whoever over here is still planning PHP-GTK3 that was mentioning \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it in January, please post an update on the fact that you are indeed \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on a 3rd update or planning a 3rd update to the main page at \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gtk.php.net. I realize there have been some posts to an extent on \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gtk.php.net, but none seem to say anything about what the actual \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; development happening right now is, just that "it's still happening." 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in order to attract more people, there needs to be some \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "uniformization" with the website itself. The gtk.php.net will officially \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be pronounced a living project again when the website can make a PHP-GTK \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blue theme that goes along with the main site's theme at php.net. The \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current site looks like what php.net used to look like, but not what the \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual php.net looks like anymore. If we can make PHP-GTK's website look \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like a blue version on par with php.net's current purple version, then the \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people come are gonna be like "When did this happen? Just yesterday it \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked outdated!!" 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though the saying goes "Don't judge a book by it's cover," people will \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always end up doing just that. So, who in this project has been working on \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK3?  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (If there are any corrections to what I just said about Glade and GTK, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't mention them here because I will likely figure them out as time goes \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on, all I'm requesting is that somebody puts it out there that PHP-GTK3 is \

I may need to make changes, because the reason I took interest in this project was \
because a teacher told me he didn't use PHP because it was only used for web \
scripting. I also want to use it as a way to develop some of the applications for an \
operating system my friend and I are building (he likes design, hence glade, and I \
like actual code, hence PHP). It seems that all that "PHP-GTK" had going for it was \
upgrading PHP counterparts. What it sounds like it needs is a total overhaul, and I \
may end up doing just that, but it would sound easier if I had the code that \
Alexandre made for php 5.4. I emailed him asking about the website as well, and I'd \
like to know how to gain commit access, editing, etc., because I need this. It will \
make development much more easier because while my friend designs without a clue how \
to program, I can then take his designs and make them work. 

And Andrei jumped ship? Man, if I jumped ship, I'd find someone to take my place \
before leaving. 

I realize that other bindings are available like Python, but I prefer to not have to \
learn how to reinvent the wheel. I need Alexandre's work to build off of as he did a \
lot by upping the support to 5.4. I would have liked for him to have gotten up to \
5.6, but it doesn't make a difference like the other two components. I will try to \
get my hands on his work and continue on, because I have reasons for developing \
forward even if they aren't specifically for this whole project. 

On a further note, if I get my hands on the correct stuff needed, I will make the \
third attempt to bring this back, particularly to make it heard that PHP cannot be \
downsized because it doesn't need a compiler. Its a powerful language that can be \
used to make both websites and applications, and I want to keep it that way. 

Also, any changes I make will be released back into the community.

Just asked Bruno about his version of v3, and I don't have replies from either one. I \
want to make things uniform, and so in order to do that, I would request that if both \
Bruno and Alexandre were working on separate projects and one just stopped abruptly \
and had components that the other one didn't have for their version of v3, then take \
the code of the now inactive developer's code to implement the missing components. \
Again, merging projects could save some time in the long run as both made \
improvements upon what somebody else left to die.

&gt; I may need to make changes, because the reason I took interest in this project was \
&gt; because a teacher told me he didn't use PHP because it was only used for web \
&gt; scripting. I also want to use it as a way to develop some of the applications for \
&gt; an operating system my friend and I are building (he likes design, hence glade, and \
&gt; I like actual code, hence PHP). It seems that all that "PHP-GTK" had going for it \
&gt; was upgrading PHP counterparts. What it sounds like it needs is a total overhaul, \
&gt; and I may end up doing just that, but it would sound easier if I had the code that \
&gt; Alexandre made for php 5.4. I emailed him asking about the website as well, and I'd \
&gt; like to know how to gain commit access, editing, etc., because I need this. It will \
&gt; make development much more easier because while my friend designs without a clue \
&gt; how to program, I can then take his designs and make them work.  
&gt; And Andrei jumped ship? Man, if I jumped ship, I'd find someone to take my place \
&gt; before leaving.  
&gt; I realize that other bindings are available like Python, but I prefer to not have \
&gt; to learn how to reinvent the wheel. I need Alexandre's work to build off of as he \
&gt; did a lot by upping the support to 5.4. I would have liked for him to have gotten \
&gt; up to 5.6, but it doesn't make a difference like the other two components. I will \
&gt; try to get my hands on his work and continue on, because I have reasons for \
&gt; developing forward even if they aren't specifically for this whole project.  
&gt; On a further note, if I get my hands on the correct stuff needed, I will make the \
&gt; third attempt to bring this back, particularly to make it heard that PHP cannot be \
&gt; downsized because it doesn't need a compiler. Its a powerful language that can be \
&gt; used to make both websites and applications, and I want to keep it that way.  
&gt; Also, any changes I make will be released back into the community.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good Afternoon Madeleine,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you happen to be using is GTK2, which was replaced years ago. \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although some may say that GTK3 is relatively new, that would be what \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd assume was due to its role in the controversial GNOME3 development. \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Timeframes for these two I currently don't have on me.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even worse, Glade3 has been out since August 12. 2006. So even though \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glade 3.8 can be used with GTK2, I can't find a package for GTK2. \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, even the docs on gtk.php.net need an overhaul, which I \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have a hard time writing because I can't even fully utilize \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK yet.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I'm looking into is using PHP-GTK with GTK3 and Glade3.(19?). I \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read the archives and it was said something was in the works, but it \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't look like anything has come to fruition yet.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because GTK2 isn't even available anymore, and  PHP-GTK thus won't \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build for Glade even if it finds support, PHP-GTK needs to be \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "overhauled" for both packages (Glade3 and GTK3), something of which I \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have no idea how to do. I emailed Andrei directly about helping out, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but he seems to not have been in his inbox for a while.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, Windows for some odd reason has both Glade3 and GTK3 for PHP-GTK, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but right now neither are built-in for Linux. I use Ubuntu and without \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these, PHP-GTK will stand a sitting duck. It's not dead, there's just \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not enough people. If whoever over here is still planning PHP-GTK3 that \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was mentioning it in January, please post an update on the fact that \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are indeed working on a 3rd update or planning a 3rd update to the \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; main page at gtk.php.net. I realize there have been some posts to an \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent on gtk.php.net, but none seem to say anything about what the \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual development happening right now is, just that "it's still \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happening." 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in order to attract more people, there needs to be some \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "uniformization" with the website itself. The gtk.php.net will \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; officially be pronounced a living project again when the website can \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make a PHP-GTK blue theme that goes along with the main site's theme at \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; php.net. The current site looks like what php.net used to look like, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not what the actual php.net looks like anymore. If we can make \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK's website look like a blue version on par with php.net's \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current purple version, then the people come are gonna be like "When \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did this happen? Just yesterday it looked outdated!!" 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though the saying goes "Don't judge a book by it's cover," people \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will always end up doing just that. So, who in this project has been \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on PHP-GTK3?  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (If there are any corrections to what I just said about Glade and GTK, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't mention them here because I will likely figure them out as time \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goes on, all I'm requesting is that somebody puts it out there that \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK3 is in fact underway and what the game plan is, even if \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incomplete)

Good evening,

1) Mr. Andrei is no longer involved in the project a few years.
I sent an email to Mr. Andrei asking if I could go with my ideas to make 
the active php-gtk project again.
One of the answers I got:
"I think it's great That You want to pick up the project, good luck with 
it."

2) I made a short stop in reshaping the site because he wanted to
define how the php-gtk3 will be developed.
Bruno and I agreed that nothing should be reused the source code of PHP-GTK2
And I also have to decide the entry of new components: For example, the 
latest version of glade, Cairo and others.

3) We also need to set teams with enough Karma in http://git.php.net/ 
for documentation, code development for php-gtk3 and project site 
maintenance.

4) PHP-gtk3 will be developed from scratch. I will create a repository 
this weekend. Where will I put a base extension to start.

5) I want to thank Elizabeth and others who kept the project alive over 
the past few years.
Thank you

Boa noite,
1) O senhor Andrei já não está envolvido no projeto a alguns anos.
Eu enviei uma e-mail para o senhor Andrei perguntando se eu poderia 
seguir com  as minhas idéias para tornar o projeto php-gtk ativo novamente.
Uma das respostas que eu obtive:
"I think it's great that you want to pick up the project, good luck with 
it."
2) Eu fiz uma pequena parada na reformulação do site pois queria definir 
como o php-gtk3 será desenvolvido.
Bruno e eu concordamos que nada dever ser reaproveitado do código fonte 
do PHP-GTK2
E eu tenho também tenho que decidir a entrada de novos componentes: Por 
exemplo, a última versão do glade, cairo e outros.
3) Nós também precisamos definir equipes com Karma suficiente no 
http://git.php.net/ para a documentação, desenvolvimento do código para 
o php-gtk3 e para manutenção do  site do projeto.
4) O PHP-GTK3 será desenvolvido do zero. Eu irei criar um repositório 
este final de semana. Onde eu irei colocar um extensão base para começarmos.
5) Quero agradecer a Elizabeth e outros que mantiveram o projeto vivo 
durante estes últimos anos.
Obrigado

    I'm not real sure other than the fact that unless you either have a new install \
of PHP from source or this particular patch, PHP-GTK2 fails on Ubuntu. Try it without \
a source install on Ubuntu's default installation of PHP and you'll get an error - \
then apply the patch and it just magically works. Would adding the one-liner screw it \
up for folks on platforms other than Ubuntu and (possibly) Debian, or is it possible \
to add it in with no harm? It's a couple years old it looks like, the article's info \
is outdated but the patch did happen to fix that Ubuntu-PHP pothole I ran into. Until \
                further notice I will revise the README.

Good Evening, Ben!
I removed the patch instructions for SquirrelsHateRobots as well as updated the URLs \
and modified some of the text to fit in without the usage of the SquirrelsHateRobots \
patch. It is included in this email.

&gt; &gt; Hey, good afternoon, Ben:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've updated the README with two different Linux methods for installation
&gt; &gt; of PHP-GTK2: One for those who want a dedicated PHP install, or those who
&gt; &gt; would rather apply a patch and move on. Despite Ubuntu-specific, on other
&gt; &gt; Linux systems the commands would either be the same or they would be only
&gt; &gt; slightly different.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I created a patch with diff:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Gage,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the README patch. I have a couple recommendations for changes:
&gt; 
&gt; You mention that Cairo should be checked out using Subversion. However, the
&gt; Subversion repository listed is old and no longer maintained. Cairo's main
&gt; repository is now on GitHub, so your instructions should be updated to
&gt; clone from the Git repository instead. The Cairo PECL extension source is
&gt; now located here: https://github.com/gtkforphp/cairo
&gt; 
&gt; Likewise, you mention checking out the php-gtk source from a Subversion
&gt; repository. This repository no longer exists and has been migrated to Git.
&gt; Please update your instructions to show cloning from the Git repository.
&gt; The primary upstream repository URL is
&gt; https://git.php.net/repository/php/gtk-src.git (see also
&gt; http://git.php.net/?p=php/gtk-src.git;a=summary), but you may also chose to
&gt; use the GitHub URL for convenience: https://github.com/php/php-gtk-src.
&gt; I'll leave that up to you.
&gt; 
&gt; What does the SquirrelsHatesRobots patch do for php-gtk2? You need to make
&gt; it clear why you're suggesting the use of the SquirrelsHatesRobots patch; I
&gt; would prefer not to advocate the use of a third-party patch in the main
&gt; project README, unless it's absolutely necessary. Is this a patch that
&gt; should be merged into the primary project repository? It looks like it's a
&gt; single line addition to build2/build2.mk.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Ben

Hey, good afternoon, Ben:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I've updated the README with two \
different Linux methods for installation&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of PHP-GTK2: One for those who \
want a dedicated PHP install, or those who&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; would rather apply a patch \
and move on. Despite Ubuntu-specific, on other&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Linux systems the \
commands would either be the same or they would be only&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; slightly \
different.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I created a patch with diff:&lt;br&gt;&gt; \
&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Gage,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks for the README patch. I have a \
couple recommendations for changes:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; You mention that Cairo should be \
checked out using Subversion. However, the&lt;br&gt;&gt; Subversion repository listed is \
old and no longer maintained. Cairo's main&lt;br&gt;&gt; repository is now on GitHub, so \
your instructions should be updated to&lt;br&gt;&gt; clone from the Git repository instead. \
The Cairo PECL extension source is&lt;br&gt;&gt; now located here: \
https://github.com/gtkforphp/cairo&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Likewise, you mention checking \
out the php-gtk source from a Subversion&lt;br&gt;&gt; repository. This repository no \
longer exists and has been migrated to Git.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Please update your instructions \
to show cloning from the Git repository.&lt;br&gt;&gt; The primary upstream repository URL \
is&lt;br&gt;&gt; https://git.php.net/repository/php/gtk-src.git (see also&lt;br&gt;&gt; \
http://git.php.net/?p=php/gtk-src.git;a=summary), but you may also chose to&lt;br&gt;&gt; \
use the GitHub URL for convenience: https://github.com/php/php-gtk-src.&lt;br&gt;&gt; I'll \
leave that up to you.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; What does the SquirrelsHatesRobots patch do \
for php-gtk2? You need to make&lt;br&gt;&gt; it clear why you're suggesting the use of the \
SquirrelsHatesRobots patch; I&lt;br&gt;&gt; would prefer not to advocate the use of a \
third-party patch in the main&lt;br&gt;&gt; project README, unless it's absolutely \
necessary. Is this a patch that&lt;br&gt;&gt; should be merged into the primary project \
repository? It looks like it's a&lt;br&gt;&gt; single line addition to \
build2/build2.mk.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ben&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 		 	   		  \

Hey, all:
Just wanting to know what needs done next in order to get KARMA. I've got like one \
day left before I have to leave, and then I have no idea what happens next. Just \
wondering what I need to do next. I've patched the README for instructions on how to \
install PHP-GTK2 using your favorite distribution's default install of PHP, and \
pointed you to a "Getting Started" page at php.net if you want  dedicated install of \
PHP to use with PHP-GTK. I do need a pointer of where to go from here, because I \
don't reallyknow anywhere else that PHP-GTK2 would need fixed up. It would be \
pointless anyway considering the fact that we're about to start on PHP-GTK3. In the \
meantime, I'm wanting to go figure out now how to start theming locally on my \
machine, as that seems to be where I want to do some of my experimentation with PHP's \
                website source.

website works with that ".router.php" file out-of-the-box and lets you access it at \
the URL http://localhost:8080. Then you can go and mod the files just as if it were \
on a webserver, of which I would have no idea how to put it on. Anyways, here's the \

the black removed because it clashes with the PHP-GTK blue color scheme.

Gage,

Can you please split this out into a new thread on php-gtk-webmaster. We
shouldn't keep hijacking the Glade3 thread on the php-gtk-dev list to
discuss the PHP-GTK website. :-)

Also, there is no image attached because PHP mailing lists strip out
attachments. You'll need to link to an externally hosted image.

Thanks,
Ben

It looks like I only have karma for doc-gtk and web-gkt, but not for the source, so I \
can't commit this patch.

Can you please submit the patch as a pull request on GitHub here? \
https://github.com/php/php-gtk-src &lt;https://github.com/php/php-gtk-src&gt;

That would make things easier for those who do have karma.

    Hey, Ben,
Just got back from the Adventure of the Seas, not going any further than that. But \
yeah, I could submit it there. How do you get karma for web-gtk? I have a working \
prototype of the php.net site on my laptop, and I tried getting it to run on an \
actual website, but it fails to work and gives errors on an actual server. But it \
does work perfectly if you run it locally at localhost:8080. I'm a bit baffled by \
that, but if it gets working on a server, it will hopefully look the way I intended \
it to.

Also, do the changes to the gtk-web repo appear live on gtk.php.net? If not, where is \
this website actually reflected from?

I'm subscribed. Sent a message out earlier but never received a repeat message of \
what I sent back, Alexandre. Also, is there a MARC archive of the webmaster list? I'm \
deep into this. I won't be getting the big stuff done till the end of the month \
though. I normally get messages sent by myself sent to myself by this list, so if \
that's considered normal for all lists, there may be an issue with the webmaster \
list.

&gt; &gt; Hey, Ben,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just got back from the Adventure of the Seas, not going any further than that. \
&gt; &gt; But yeah, I could submit it there. How do you get karma for web-gtk? I have a \
&gt; &gt; working prototype of the php.net site on my laptop, and I tried getting it to run \
&gt; &gt; on an actual website, but it fails to work and gives errors on an actual server. \
&gt; &gt; But it does work perfectly if you run it locally at localhost:8080. I'm a bit \
&gt; &gt; baffled by that, but if it gets working on a server, it will hopefully look the \
&gt; &gt; way I intended it to. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, do the changes to the gtk-web repo appear live on gtk.php.net? If not, \
&gt; &gt; where is this website actually reflected from?

I configured my email client to receive all the newsgroup php.net.

You clicked on a link to confirm your registration on the list in the

Yes, I confirmed. But there are four in the table:

I have sent 203 emails out there but unlike these four, no responses got sent back \

an email right away telling me to subscribe, whereas radio silence on that end (at \

&gt; If I understand what you want: a window manager style: KDE, GNOME ...
&gt; It will not be easy ... But I will not say it's impossible.
&gt; I advise you to open a project, for example, on github.
&gt; This will help you find people willing to believe in your window manager.
&gt; And its development will be faster.

Dear developers,
    Is there any update information on how to build (on Windows and on
Linux as well)? I mean informaton about requirements, tools, and how to
build on Windows and Linux. I'm using PHP GTK on my many enterprise
projects so I'd like to build the newer version (especially on Windows
since it is 5.2.x). The linux version is not much problem.

Tanes,
Good evening,
We will work on it as soon as possible.
I already have a tutorial in Portuguese to make the compilation windows.
I'll translate it into English and put on the site.
While we do not place on the site ... if you want you can get the builds 
of php-gtk for Windows with PHP 5.4 or 5.5 in the download area on 
http://gtk.php.net/ site.
On the website of the Brazilian community, 
http://www.php-gtk.com.br/linux, there is a compilation of php-gtk for 
linux with php 5.3.
I will work in compiling php with php-gtk 5.5 or 5.6 for Linux.
Then I put on the site http://gtk.php.net/ the php-gtk compiled for 
Linux and the tutorial.
thank you

Good afternoon,
We do not yet have a repository for php-gtk3.
We study how best to implement it.
But this could take, because we will develop a version with scratch gtk3.
thank you

Two developers named Alexandre and Bruno both made their own "forks" of PHP-GTK2 on \
GitHub. I am requesting that they put aside their differences if any and merge the \
two into one in order to make PHP-GTK3 a reality. I fthere is any way I can help, I \
will. 

If anyone has a way to get one, the easiest part for me to do to get the project off \
the ground is one of these and a way to commit to the official SVN for php-gtk on \
php.net. I guess it didn't take long for me to figure out I'd be doing two projects \
at one time: 

http://gtk.php.net/admin-login.php

If possible, I'd like to redesign the site in accordance to what php.net currently \
looks like as a website, and if you haven't seen it since before late fall 2013, then \
I recommend heading over and looking at the design. I can envision a baby-blue theme \
similar to that of what php-gtk had done before with php.net's former theme. (Design \
wise, not content!)

Again, this project needs to start getting updated. The components that need the most \
work are particularly Glade3 and GTK3, as both are particularly needed to say it has \
support for Glade, and Glade/GTK 2 were both dropped in favor of the 3rd version of \
each, thus rendering support for Glade in Ubuntu and other distros unusable because \
the packages required are no longer available, replaced with incompatible third \
versions. 

There seem to be two projects: Both should be merged; you can't have two releases \
named PHP-GTK3, and if neither are working, I would request both sources to merge and \
then I would update the end result myself, though I hope that both developers are \
still working (Alexandre and Bruno) and may merge their projects together despite \
their differences (if any) to make a more whole PHP-GTK3 release not only possible \
but closer to being done. If help is needed, when I get back from family vacation in \
2-3 weeks from now I will. 

Don't give up, the end result is worth the work.

&gt; Just asked Bruno about his version of v3, and I don't have replies from either one. \
&gt; I want to make things uniform, and so in order to do that, I would request that if \
&gt; both Bruno and Alexandre were working on separate projects and one just stopped \
&gt; abruptly and had components that the other one didn't have for their version of v3, \
&gt; then take the code of the now inactive developer's code to implement the missing \
&gt; components. Again, merging projects could save some time in the long run as both \
&gt; made improvements upon what somebody else left to die.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I may need to make changes, because the reason I took interest in this project \
&gt; &gt; was because a teacher told me he didn't use PHP because it was only used for web \
&gt; &gt; scripting. I also want to use it as a way to develop some of the applications for \
&gt; &gt; an operating system my friend and I are building (he likes design, hence glade, \
&gt; &gt; and I like actual code, hence PHP). It seems that all that "PHP-GTK" had going \
&gt; &gt; for it was upgrading PHP counterparts. What it sounds like it needs is a total \
&gt; &gt; overhaul, and I may end up doing just that, but it would sound easier if I had \
&gt; &gt; the code that Alexandre made for php 5.4. I emailed him asking about the website \
&gt; &gt; as well, and I'd like to know how to gain commit access, editing, etc., because I \
&gt; &gt; need this. It will make development much more easier because while my friend \
&gt; &gt; designs without a clue how to program, I can then take his designs and make them \
&gt; &gt; work.  
&gt; &gt; And Andrei jumped ship? Man, if I jumped ship, I'd find someone to take my place \
&gt; &gt; before leaving.  
&gt; &gt; I realize that other bindings are available like Python, but I prefer to not have \
&gt; &gt; to learn how to reinvent the wheel. I need Alexandre's work to build off of as he \
&gt; &gt; did a lot by upping the support to 5.4. I would have liked for him to have gotten \
&gt; &gt; up to 5.6, but it doesn't make a difference like the other two components. I will \
&gt; &gt; try to get my hands on his work and continue on, because I have reasons for \
&gt; &gt; developing forward even if they aren't specifically for this whole project.  
&gt; &gt; On a further note, if I get my hands on the correct stuff needed, I will make the \
&gt; &gt; third attempt to bring this back, particularly to make it heard that PHP cannot \
&gt; &gt; be downsized because it doesn't need a compiler. Its a powerful language that can \
&gt; &gt; be used to make both websites and applications, and I want to keep it that way.  
&gt; &gt; Also, any changes I make will be released back into the community.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good Afternoon Madeleine,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you happen to be using is GTK2, which was replaced years ago. \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although some may say that GTK3 is relatively new, that would be what \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd assume was due to its role in the controversial GNOME3 \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; development. Timeframes for these two I currently don't have on me.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even worse, Glade3 has been out since August 12. 2006. So even though \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glade 3.8 can be used with GTK2, I can't find a package for GTK2. \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, even the docs on gtk.php.net need an overhaul, which I \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have a hard time writing because I can't even fully utilize \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK yet.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I'm looking into is using PHP-GTK with GTK3 and Glade3.(19?). I \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read the archives and it was said something was in the works, but it \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't look like anything has come to fruition yet.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because GTK2 isn't even available anymore, and  PHP-GTK thus won't \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build for Glade even if it finds support, PHP-GTK needs to be \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "overhauled" for both packages (Glade3 and GTK3), something of which \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have no idea how to do. I emailed Andrei directly about helping \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out, but he seems to not have been in his inbox for a while.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, Windows for some odd reason has both Glade3 and GTK3 for \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PHP-GTK, but right now neither are built-in for Linux. I use Ubuntu \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and without these, PHP-GTK will stand a sitting duck. It's not dead, \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there's just not enough people. If whoever over here is still \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planning PHP-GTK3 that was mentioning it in January, please post an \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; update on the fact that you are indeed working on a 3rd update or \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planning a 3rd update to the main page at gtk.php.net. I realize \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there have been some posts to an extent on gtk.php.net, but none seem \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say anything about what the actual development happening right now \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is, just that "it's still happening." 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in order to attract more people, there needs to be some \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "uniformization" with the website itself. The gtk.php.net will \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; officially be pronounced a living project again when the website can \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make a PHP-GTK blue theme that goes along with the main site's theme \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at php.net. The current site looks like what php.net used to look \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like, but not what the actual php.net looks like anymore. If we can \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make PHP-GTK's website look like a blue version on par with php.net's \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current purple version, then the people come are gonna be like "When \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did this happen? Just yesterday it looked outdated!!" 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though the saying goes "Don't judge a book by it's cover," \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people will always end up doing just that. So, who in this project \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has been working on PHP-GTK3?  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (If there are any corrections to what I just said about Glade and \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GTK, don't mention them here because I will likely figure them out as \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time goes on, all I'm requesting is that somebody puts it out there \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that PHP-GTK3 is in fact underway and what the game plan is, even if \
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incomplete)

Good evening,
We will start the project from scratch.
Bruno did a few tests.
We will use the gtk3, php version 5.6 or version 7, galde version 3.18 
and the latest stable versions of other software.
You have the karma in php.net?
thank you

&gt; Hey, guys, I'm having the same problem Bruno has, and I'm a bit irritated about it:
&gt; 
&gt; In order to contribute to PHP.net, you need an insane amount of requirements \
&gt; completed to contribute to any projects under PHP.net. It's a bureaucracy,

I really agree that this is bureaucracy.
But on the other hand, remind that PHP *had* (note it's in the past) a 
long time reputation of "amateur langage" and they (PHP Bureau) really 
need to get rid of it.
I dont have the full story, but one solution for you is to get you 
patches through Ben, as he suggested.

Keep going on, Gage.
Cheers.

Good afternoon php-gtk community.
Branch development of PHP-GTK3 is dev-php-gtk3.
All development of PH-gtk3 will be done in this branch.
Be careful when doing push. You should make sure to checkout the correct 
branch dev-php-gtk3.
We will only do merge with the master branch when PHP-GTK3 is stable and 
functional.
I the next few days put more files on the standard of the project and 
the php-gtk3 the skel branch in dev-php-gtk3.
Thanks

&gt; As for the documentation I have a working knowledge of the system if

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi folks.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The mailing list got REALLY busy all of the sudden.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been having issues with php mailing lists (they REALLY don't like
&gt; &gt; &gt; my email) and just realized all the stuff going on here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all it's great to have people interested in the project.  For
&gt; &gt; &gt; a LONG time it's been 1 or 2 people... with a few popping up here or
&gt; &gt; &gt; there to get interested and then moving on quickly (usually when they
&gt; &gt; &gt; realize how much work needs to be done)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And although there's been someone keeping track of the actual code
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself - the website was completely abandoned (thanks for taking that
&gt; &gt; &gt; monstrosity on) and the documentation has been similarly abandoned
&gt; &gt; &gt; (it's in old docbook and uses xsl to generate) - the people who once
&gt; &gt; &gt; knew how that worked are gone
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There have actually been a couple of attempts to start up a php-gtk3
&gt; &gt; &gt; project before.  But it's a BIG undertaking and only having 1 or 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; people work on it makes it difficult to get off the ground.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There's also the fact that a fully introspected version of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; extension (like pythons gobject) have some pretty deep underlying
&gt; &gt; &gt; issues (mostly related to the typelibs and the fact that they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; strongly linked in many aspects to the python gobject wrapping
&gt; &gt; &gt; implementation) - which is why although there's a prototype of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; introspected solution it doesn't really work well.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you're interested in some of the code you can find it
&gt; &gt; &gt; https://github.com/gtkforphp/ - some of it was actually working once
&gt; &gt; &gt; upon a time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's a good idea to do a "new" gtk for php but I think there
&gt; &gt; &gt; are some things to keep in mind.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. We do have an irc channel on freenode #php-gtk - this is a great
&gt; &gt; &gt; way to connect with the people who still work on the project and know
&gt; &gt; &gt; the code - not  only the php-gtk code and php internals code, but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; gnome libraries as well.  Especially when talking technical details
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's nice to do it in realtime.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The project has never been completely dead - it just basically only
&gt; &gt; &gt; had one dev  (who is poor at recruiting) for a long time - which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; never a good thing
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The php-gtk source code is on php.net and mirrored on github -
&gt; &gt; &gt; there have been some prs but not a lot - and none from the people now
&gt; &gt; &gt; currently conversing on the list -  and it's also limited to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem of basically 1 developer to look at and pull them
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Discussions on the future should be all on list - not in private emails :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some thoughts on a complete rewrite
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. a monolithic extension is not very useful - php-gtk should become
&gt; &gt; &gt; several small extensions
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; right now php-gtk has wrappings for gtk, gdk, some glib, atk, some
&gt; &gt; &gt; cairo integration (although most of cairo was pulled into it's own
&gt; &gt; &gt; extension)  and many others
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; parts of glib, cairo, and other gnome libraries such as clutter make
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense to use not only in a gui environment, but even in a server
&gt; &gt; &gt; environment
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This would even allow for things like a gtk2 and gtk3 extension
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the extension(s) should probably mirror the underlying libraries
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; glib, gobject, gio, cairo(exists, is getting a php7 fix), pango (also
&gt; &gt; &gt; exists), atk, gtk2, gtk3, gdk, clutter, gstreamer, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If you're rewriting from scratch, a PHP7 only version is probably a good \
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The internal apis of php have changed an incredible amount from 5 -&gt; 7
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it would be both very ugly and very hard to support both PHP7 and
&gt; &gt; &gt; PHP 5.6(and higher) in the same code base
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. PHP-gtk has very very few tests... and needs them
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is probably as important as the rewrite - although you really
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't need to test the functionality of the gtk library itself, it IS
&gt; &gt; &gt; important to make sure the bindings are tight.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as getting php-gtk commit karma, that's really not that hard
&gt; &gt; &gt; Submit some PR's - usually 2 or 3 good ones with tests
&gt; &gt; &gt; Discuss things on list and/or in IRC
&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as stuff doesn't break the build and works it gets pulled -
&gt; &gt; &gt; but remember right now there's 1 dev... so expect lag time (maybe a
&gt; &gt; &gt; week) until there are 2 or 3 or more devs capable of code reviewing,
&gt; &gt; &gt; building, and testing - because you need those checks
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you need help getting an environment for compiling set up on
&gt; &gt; &gt; windows or linux - I'm happy to help.  Pop into irc.  If you're really
&gt; &gt; &gt; ambitious someone could update the documentation :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also php-gtk could really use someone to roll releases.  We actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; should have had about 3-4 - there's been new functionality added and
&gt; &gt; &gt; build fixes done and features integrated.. just no release.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For example - there is complete gtkbuilder integration in the git
&gt; &gt; &gt; version of php-gtk (that's the format glade3 outputs btw) - but none
&gt; &gt; &gt; of that is documented beyond some demo files.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,

Good evening,
Let's try to keep each issue on your list:
Documentation: php-gtk-doc@lists.php.net
Source: php-gtk-dev@lists.php.net
website: php-gtk-webmaster@lists.php.net
General topics: php-gtk-general@lists.php.net
Thus, for example, who only participates in the documentation list will 
not lose it.
thank you

&gt; &gt; be heading out to Puerto Rico to board a cruise ship and I'm a bit sad Internet \
&gt; &gt; is like $0.50 a minute. I can do some of the basic stuff, but you know it's an \
&gt; &gt; iPad, and sometimes carrying a laptop around with you if not at a developer \
&gt; &gt; conference or similar event can be a risk. I've taken it to WordCamp, but I'm in \
&gt; &gt; a cabin in the woods for about a week. Then there's the TSA that we have to worry \
&gt; &gt; about, and my trust with them is low due to past experience (go study up on some \
&gt; &gt; regulations etc., before flight because there may be fight beforehand, they are \
&gt; &gt; kinda snoopy) and a $500 laptop that works great for $500. I would take it but I \
&gt; &gt; have other developer projeccts on there that I don't want someone else to have, \
&gt; &gt; and it's running on Ubuntu, which is Linux on physical hardware, and if you know \
&gt; &gt; anything about that, you can do bad things with access to the physical hardware.
&gt; Note that git is wonderful for offline working. You can clone php-gtk, 
&gt; and any other project you may need (glib, cairo...) and work 
&gt; disconnected for a month,* then merge your changes.
&gt; You will need a laptop, though. You could take an image of your laptop 
&gt; (leave that at home), then format it and reinstall with a crypted 
&gt; filesystem (LUKS), so no data can extracted unless you provide the 
&gt; password at boot (however there's the "$5 wrench attack"). I'm not sure 
&gt; if you are concerned about the TSA messsing with your hardware, either.
&gt; 
&gt; * Most likely, you will realise you miss many dependencies at the 
&gt; beginning, so I don't recommend not using it until you're in the ocean.

Hey, guys, in case you didn't know, I'm 17, and I have a messed up schedule having \
divorced parents and all. I currently have two sides to deal with, my dad's side not \
wanting me to have computer access and my mom's side wanting me to, particularly \
because the other side doesn't. I am going on a cruise with my mom, and she doesn't \
want me to bring my laptop, and I may be going with my dad after I get back. The next \
extended period of time I have at my mom's after this cruise BS will be dedicated to \
making patches in order to get KARMA access, and, if time allows, get this website \
redesigned. 

Thank you all for your patience, I WILL be back.

Hey, good afternoon, Ben:
I've updated the README with two different Linux methods for installation of \
PHP-GTK2: One for those who want a dedicated PHP install, or those who would rather \
apply a patch and move on. Despite Ubuntu-specific, on other Linux systems the \
commands would either be the same or they would be only slightly different.  I \
created a patch with diff:

Bruno,
Good evening,
I know that you have already started a project alone make the php-gtk3.
Let's start making the php-gtk 3 on the official project?
thank you

Hey, guys, I'm having the same problem Bruno has, and I'm a bit irritated about it:

In order to contribute to PHP.net, you need an insane amount of requirements \
completed to contribute to any projects under PHP.net. It's a bureaucracy, and if \
they say its meritocracy, they should go look at WordPress. WordPress actually votes \
on what gets added in the next release, but if you do a project and bring it to the \
table, you are judged on how many contributions were made prior and your level of \
"merit" is decided based on how many contributions for the good were made in the \
past. Although what gets in and out is up to the leads, what projects get worked on \
can be brought to the table and worked on, but then to get into the release a team \
from WordPress core and the community will look into each project and either say it \
will or it won't be added. I did ask over there to work on a project, and Andrew \
Nacin replied that projects don't go by a version basis but instead a completion. So \
if your project doesn't make it, there's always next time. 

But I'm not seeing the same drive at php.net. Putting politics aside, wouldn't you \
think they would WANT contributions? And the same with WordPress.org, though you \
usually go through someone else with commit access, as I've read that usually only \
leads keep commit rights, and leads get chosen by Matt Mullenwag or something like \
that, every two years. But anyway, I'm finding it increasingly harder to do things \
around here. I don't know why they need to make things harder than they should be, \
especially for side projects of theirs that they keep like this one. I'm not giving \
up at all, but if possible, they got two people with potential that need appropriate \
rights, one with very basic knowledge of C++, the other with none, and that's with me \
and Bruno: He doesn't like KARMA any more than I do, and I realize what they're \
trying to do (security, etc.) but it only ever makes things harder to do for those \
who are new and mean well (like me and Bruno). 

Now, I realize to develop this you do need some C/C++ knowledge, but to get git \
commit access/KARMA, you need to write C code for the PHP main branch first, which is \
where I'm stuck at in the process, instead of doing what I came here to do in the \
first place, which is working with Alexandre and Bruno, who happens to have the same \
issue as the one I just mentioned here. So, before anyone is offended, I apologize \
for the rant, but this project is going nowhere fast without contributors, and those \
contributors that this particular project need the most are stuck on the other side \
of the front door without a key. You have two contributors; one who gave up trying to \
get in, the other weighing his options. Bruno and I can only do what we came here to \
do if we're given appropriate permissions, and right now, there's no proper way for \
PHP.net to tell we're not two trolls on the Internet looking to grief some data \
(which we're not; we are actually quite the exact opposite). I don't know whether he \
meant to send this to the group or not, but he sent me this message, and my God he \
sounded desperate:

&gt; Hello Gage, sorry for delay to answer you, first for my personal issues,
&gt; second for my bad english
&gt; 
&gt; ​For years I have see​n very enthusiasts people, who never seen c/c++
&gt; sources and with alot of pression to do the project. So I decided to create
&gt; my own repo on github, and make some tests
&gt; 
&gt; My tests are not definitively, and has alot of things to think about.
&gt; Structures, generators, people to code, and alot other things
&gt; 
&gt; I have created this repo about a year ago, and nobody contribute with one
&gt; line of code, and think about all php-gtk structure alone can be hard
&gt; 
&gt; I think you can see how disappointed I am, but my tests will continue, on
&gt; my time, but will continue
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you, and whisp me for ANYTHING you need



So, while I finish this message, please consider contacting SOMEBODY who can do \
something about this, even if you disagree with what I'm saying. I forget whether or \
not it was PHP that said it was a meritocracy, because I'm starting to see more and \
more of them by the day, such as Ubuntu. But regardless, in order to help, it \
shouldn't mean you should have to go through Mission Impossible in order to do so.

I don't mean to sound like Tupac when I say this, but don't you think it might be \
time for a change, albeit a small one? Well, there's two guys waiting to get started, \
and one of them is me, so while I struggle to get in, someone else gave up, and that \
someone else gave up because no matter how hard he knocked, apparently nobody let him \
in. 

Thank you; you are probably the best community of developers I've seen, and a \
appreciate your support and/or patience.

Contributing code to the PHP core is not a requirement for getting karma to PHP-GTK. \
If you have patches for PHP-GTK, send them as pull requests, and I can get them in \
for you (I have PHP-GTK karma). After I've merged in a pull request or two, we can do \
a karma request, and I'll be happy to vouch for you.

Hi folks.

The mailing list got REALLY busy all of the sudden.

I've been having issues with php mailing lists (they REALLY don't like
my email) and just realized all the stuff going on here.

First of all it's great to have people interested in the project.  For
a LONG time it's been 1 or 2 people... with a few popping up here or
there to get interested and then moving on quickly (usually when they
realize how much work needs to be done)

And although there's been someone keeping track of the actual code
itself - the website was completely abandoned (thanks for taking that
monstrosity on) and the documentation has been similarly abandoned
(it's in old docbook and uses xsl to generate) - the people who once
knew how that worked are gone

There have actually been a couple of attempts to start up a php-gtk3
project before.  But it's a BIG undertaking and only having 1 or 2
people work on it makes it difficult to get off the ground.

There's also the fact that a fully introspected version of the
extension (like pythons gobject) have some pretty deep underlying
issues (mostly related to the typelibs and the fact that they are
strongly linked in many aspects to the python gobject wrapping
implementation) - which is why although there's a prototype of an
introspected solution it doesn't really work well.

If you're interested in some of the code you can find it
https://github.com/gtkforphp/ - some of it was actually working once
upon a time.

I think it's a good idea to do a "new" gtk for php but I think there
are some things to keep in mind.

1. We do have an irc channel on freenode #php-gtk - this is a great
way to connect with the people who still work on the project and know
the code - not  only the php-gtk code and php internals code, but the
gnome libraries as well.  Especially when talking technical details
it's nice to do it in realtime.
2. The project has never been completely dead - it just basically only
had one dev  (who is poor at recruiting) for a long time - which is
never a good thing
3. The php-gtk source code is on php.net and mirrored on github -
there have been some prs but not a lot - and none from the people now
currently conversing on the list -  and it's also limited to the
problem of basically 1 developer to look at and pull them
4. Discussions on the future should be all on list - not in private emails :)

Some thoughts on a complete rewrite

1. a monolithic extension is not very useful - php-gtk should become
several small extensions

right now php-gtk has wrappings for gtk, gdk, some glib, atk, some
cairo integration (although most of cairo was pulled into it's own
extension)  and many others

parts of glib, cairo, and other gnome libraries such as clutter make
sense to use not only in a gui environment, but even in a server
environment

This would even allow for things like a gtk2 and gtk3 extension

the extension(s) should probably mirror the underlying libraries

glib, gobject, gio, cairo(exists, is getting a php7 fix), pango (also
exists), atk, gtk2, gtk3, gdk, clutter, gstreamer, etc.

2. If you're rewriting from scratch, a PHP7 only version is probably a good idea

The internal apis of php have changed an incredible amount from 5 -&gt; 7
and it would be both very ugly and very hard to support both PHP7 and
PHP 5.6(and higher) in the same code base

3. PHP-gtk has very very few tests... and needs them

This is probably as important as the rewrite - although you really
don't need to test the functionality of the gtk library itself, it IS
important to make sure the bindings are tight.

As far as getting php-gtk commit karma, that's really not that hard
Submit some PR's - usually 2 or 3 good ones with tests
Discuss things on list and/or in IRC
As long as stuff doesn't break the build and works it gets pulled -
but remember right now there's 1 dev... so expect lag time (maybe a
week) until there are 2 or 3 or more devs capable of code reviewing,
building, and testing - because you need those checks

If you need help getting an environment for compiling set up on
windows or linux - I'm happy to help.  Pop into irc.  If you're really
ambitious someone could update the documentation :)

Also php-gtk could really use someone to roll releases.  We actually
should have had about 3-4 - there's been new functionality added and
build fixes done and features integrated.. just no release.

For example - there is complete gtkbuilder integration in the git
version of php-gtk (that's the format glade3 outputs btw) - but none
of that is documented beyond some demo files.

Thanks,
Elizabeth M Smith

Here in about a week I'll be out in the middle of the Carribean without Internet on a \
cruise ship, so I'm just putting that out there. As for the extreme amount of \
activity, that probably happened as soon as I got here, as the first person to \
respond was Madeleine, and it went downhill when I started to "bug" the devs - pun \
intended. I don't mean to be most of the time, but I end up a walking, talking \
controversy for only God knows what reason. 

After I arrived, I saw a lot of people show up I hadn't seen before, particularly \
Bruno and Alexandre. I needed this for a project being worked on by myself and my \
friend, Elijah. So I was persistant and people showed up. 

As for the website, does anyone here think a wiki would fit? Anyways, I partially \
want to retheme the website because this one still uses the legacy theme. So, I \
started with the mailing list first because I tried IRC and it was like radio silence \
out there. I just thought this looked like a good place to kickstart, and now look, \
people!

Anyways, I appreciate the support I've been able to find here, because most \
communities would rather argue with me for some reason or other, and that rant I just \
went on (sorry about that, but bureaucracies do happen to piss me off) was one hing \
that draws negative attention. If it's to the point past that I usually just leave, \
but this community is starting to dig itself back out of its grave that an assumption \
made people think it was in. And then that assumption that it was dead put it \
underground for some time, although it never died officially. Now we're kickstarting, \
and I cannot wait for about halfway into July, because that's possibly the best time \
to start trying for karma (I'm writing on an iPad right now) because I'm on vacation \
with one side of my family but in about a week I'll be heading out to Puerto Rico to \
board a cruise ship and I'm a bit sad Internet is like $0.50 a minute. I can do some \
of the basic stuff, but you know it's an iPad, and sometimes carrying a laptop around \
with you if not at a developer conference or similar event can be a risk. I've taken \
it to WordCamp, but I'm in a cabin in the woods for about a week. Then there's the \
TSA that we have to worry about, and my trust with them is low due to past experience \
(go study up on some regulations etc., before flight because there may be fight \
beforehand, they are kinda snoopy) and a $500 laptop that works great for $500. I \
would take it but I have other developer projeccts on there that I don't want someone \
else to have, and it's running on Ubuntu, which is Linux on physical hardware, and if \
you know anything about that, you can do bad things with access to the physical \
hardware. 

So, having said that, I'm gonna try to get karma in about two to two and a half \
weeks, it may toward the middle of next month. Thanks guys, this is why I've stayed. \
;)

Note that git is wonderful for offline working. You can clone php-gtk, 
and any other project you may need (glib, cairo...) and work 
disconnected for a month,* then merge your changes.
You will need a laptop, though. You could take an image of your laptop 
(leave that at home), then format it and reinstall with a crypted 
filesystem (LUKS), so no data can extracted unless you provide the 
password at boot (however there's the "$5 wrench attack"). I'm not sure 
if you are concerned about the TSA messsing with your hardware, either.

* Most likely, you will realise you miss many dependencies at the 
beginning, so I don't recommend not using it until you're in the ocean.

Not for Long:

We're gonna bring this back around, even if it kills us (I hope; this community needs \
some revitalization badly). Bruno is testing some stuff, and Alexandre is working on \
an actual implementation. I hope to help both at two points in time, particularly \
mid- to late-July. Thank you for your support, and I appreciate those of you that \
stayed theough the darker times to help usher me in.

&gt; gnome libraries as well.  Especially when talking technical details
&gt; it's nice to do it in realtime.
&gt; 2. The project has never been completely dead - it just basically only
&gt; had one dev  (who is poor at recruiting) for a long time - which is
&gt; never a good thing
&gt; 3. The php-gtk source code is on php.net and mirrored on github -
&gt; there have been some prs but not a lot - and none from the people now
&gt; currently conversing on the list -  and it's also limited to the
&gt; problem of basically 1 developer to look at and pull them
&gt; 4. Discussions on the future should be all on list - not in private emails :)
&gt; 
&gt; Some thoughts on a complete rewrite
&gt; 
&gt; 1. a monolithic extension is not very useful - php-gtk should become
&gt; several small extensions
&gt; 
&gt; right now php-gtk has wrappings for gtk, gdk, some glib, atk, some
&gt; cairo integration (although most of cairo was pulled into it's own
&gt; extension)  and many others
&gt; 
&gt; parts of glib, cairo, and other gnome libraries such as clutter make
&gt; sense to use not only in a gui environment, but even in a server
&gt; environment
&gt; 
&gt; This would even allow for things like a gtk2 and gtk3 extension
&gt; 
&gt; the extension(s) should probably mirror the underlying libraries
&gt; 
&gt; glib, gobject, gio, cairo(exists, is getting a php7 fix), pango (also
&gt; exists), atk, gtk2, gtk3, gdk, clutter, gstreamer, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. If you're rewriting from scratch, a PHP7 only version is probably a good idea
&gt; 
&gt; The internal apis of php have changed an incredible amount from 5 -&gt; 7
&gt; and it would be both very ugly and very hard to support both PHP7 and
&gt; PHP 5.6(and higher) in the same code base
&gt; 
&gt; 3. PHP-gtk has very very few tests... and needs them
&gt; 
&gt; This is probably as important as the rewrite - although you really
&gt; don't need to test the functionality of the gtk library itself, it IS
&gt; important to make sure the bindings are tight.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as getting php-gtk commit karma, that's really not that hard
&gt; Submit some PR's - usually 2 or 3 good ones with tests
&gt; Discuss things on list and/or in IRC
&gt; As long as stuff doesn't break the build and works it gets pulled -
&gt; but remember right now there's 1 dev... so expect lag time (maybe a
&gt; week) until there are 2 or 3 or more devs capable of code reviewing,
&gt; building, and testing - because you need those checks
&gt; 
&gt; If you need help getting an environment for compiling set up on
&gt; windows or linux - I'm happy to help.  Pop into irc.  If you're really
&gt; ambitious someone could update the documentation :)
&gt; 
&gt; Also php-gtk could really use someone to roll releases.  We actually
&gt; should have had about 3-4 - there's been new functionality added and
&gt; build fixes done and features integrated.. just no release.
&gt; 
&gt; For example - there is complete gtkbuilder integration in the git
&gt; version of php-gtk (that's the format glade3 outputs btw) - but none
&gt; of that is documented beyond some demo files.

Elizabeth,

It's been a long time :D things have picked up here though the IRC
channel has remained rather quiet when ever i have popped in.

As for the documentation I have a working knowledge of the system if
anyone is interested in learning but it would be much more advised to
upgrade the documentation to a new docbook version.

Regards Leon

&gt;&gt; Hi folks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The mailing list got REALLY busy all of the sudden.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've been having issues with php mailing lists (they REALLY don't like
&gt;&gt; my email) and just realized all the stuff going on here.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; First of all it's great to have people interested in the project.  For
&gt;&gt; a LONG time it's been 1 or 2 people... with a few popping up here or
&gt;&gt; there to get interested and then moving on quickly (usually when they
&gt;&gt; realize how much work needs to be done)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And although there's been someone keeping track of the actual code
&gt;&gt; itself - the website was completely abandoned (thanks for taking that
&gt;&gt; monstrosity on) and the documentation has been similarly abandoned
&gt;&gt; (it's in old docbook and uses xsl to generate) - the people who once
&gt;&gt; knew how that worked are gone
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There have actually been a couple of attempts to start up a php-gtk3
&gt;&gt; project before.  But it's a BIG undertaking and only having 1 or 2
&gt;&gt; people work on it makes it difficult to get off the ground.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There's also the fact that a fully introspected version of the
&gt;&gt; extension (like pythons gobject) have some pretty deep underlying
&gt;&gt; issues (mostly related to the typelibs and the fact that they are
&gt;&gt; strongly linked in many aspects to the python gobject wrapping
&gt;&gt; implementation) - which is why although there's a prototype of an
&gt;&gt; introspected solution it doesn't really work well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you're interested in some of the code you can find it
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/gtkforphp/ - some of it was actually working once
&gt;&gt; upon a time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think it's a good idea to do a "new" gtk for php but I think there
&gt;&gt; are some things to keep in mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. We do have an irc channel on freenode #php-gtk - this is a great

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. The project has never been completely dead - it just basically only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had one dev  (who is poor at recruiting) for a long time - which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never a good thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The php-gtk source code is on php.net and mirrored on github -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there have been some prs but not a lot - and none from the people now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; currently conversing on the list -  and it's also limited to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem of basically 1 developer to look at and pull them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Discussions on the future should be all on list - not in private em=
ails :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some thoughts on a complete rewrite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. a monolithic extension is not very useful - php-gtk should become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; several small extensions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right now php-gtk has wrappings for gtk, gdk, some glib, atk, some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cairo integration (although most of cairo was pulled into it's own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension)  and many others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of glib, cairo, and other gnome libraries such as clutter make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sense to use not only in a gui environment, but even in a server
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This would even allow for things like a gtk2 and gtk3 extension
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the extension(s) should probably mirror the underlying libraries
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glib, gobject, gio, cairo(exists, is getting a php7 fix), pango (also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exists), atk, gtk2, gtk3, gdk, clutter, gstreamer, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. If you're rewriting from scratch, a PHP7 only version is probably a=
 good idea
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The internal apis of php have changed an incredible amount from 5 -&gt; 7
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and it would be both very ugly and very hard to support both PHP7 and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PHP 5.6(and higher) in the same code base
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. PHP-gtk has very very few tests... and needs them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is probably as important as the rewrite - although you really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't need to test the functionality of the gtk library itself, it IS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; important to make sure the bindings are tight.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as getting php-gtk commit karma, that's really not that hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Submit some PR's - usually 2 or 3 good ones with tests
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Discuss things on list and/or in IRC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as stuff doesn't break the build and works it gets pulled -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but remember right now there's 1 dev... so expect lag time (maybe a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; week) until there are 2 or 3 or more devs capable of code reviewing,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; building, and testing - because you need those checks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you need help getting an environment for compiling set up on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; windows or linux - I'm happy to help.  Pop into irc.  If you're really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ambitious someone could update the documentation :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also php-gtk could really use someone to roll releases.  We actually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should have had about 3-4 - there's been new functionality added and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; build fixes done and features integrated.. just no release.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example - there is complete gtkbuilder integration in the git
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; version of php-gtk (that's the format glade3 outputs btw) - but none
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of that is documented beyond some demo files.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth M Smith

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi folks.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mailing list got REALLY busy all of the sudden.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been having issues with php mailing lists (they REALLY don't like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my email) and just realized all the stuff going on here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First of all it's great to have people interested in the project.  For
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a LONG time it's been 1 or 2 people... with a few popping up here or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there to get interested and then moving on quickly (usually when they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize how much work needs to be done)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And although there's been someone keeping track of the actual code
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself - the website was completely abandoned (thanks for taking that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; monstrosity on) and the documentation has been similarly abandoned
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (it's in old docbook and uses xsl to generate) - the people who once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew how that worked are gone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There have actually been a couple of attempts to start up a php-gtk3
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; project before.  But it's a BIG undertaking and only having 1 or 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people work on it makes it difficult to get off the ground.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's also the fact that a fully introspected version of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extension (like pythons gobject) have some pretty deep underlying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues (mostly related to the typelibs and the fact that they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strongly linked in many aspects to the python gobject wrapping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implementation) - which is why although there's a prototype of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introspected solution it doesn't really work well.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you're interested in some of the code you can find it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; https://github.com/gtkforphp/ - some of it was actually working once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upon a time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's a good idea to do a "new" gtk for php but I think there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are some things to keep in mind.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. We do have an irc channel on freenode #php-gtk - this is a great
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way to connect with the people who still work on the project and know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the code - not  only the php-gtk code and php internals code, but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gnome libraries as well.  Especially when talking technical details
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's nice to do it in realtime.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The project has never been completely dead - it just basically only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had one dev  (who is poor at recruiting) for a long time - which is

Leon,
Good day,
I have an interest in learning and upgrading to new docbook.
I can generate documentation here for English only languages which gives 
error in reading the xmls.
I want to learn primarily how do I upload the generated documentation.
Or she are those xml staying in the manual folder?
thank you

Good day,
I have compiled the php-gtk php with php 5.4 and 5.5 for microsoft windows.
This temporarily available:
http://www.simaoebuhler.com.br/downloads/php54-gtk2.exe
and
http://www.simaoebuhler.com.br/downloads/php55-gtk2.exe
After upgrading the php-gtk website (http://gtk.php.net/).
I will provide these compilations in the official repository.
I am now working to make the php-gtk with gtk3.
The php-gtk is not dead, only paused to regain his strength.
Any help will be welcome.

The change were not published. I lost the will to participate.
I will make a site outside github and continue the php-gtk3.
