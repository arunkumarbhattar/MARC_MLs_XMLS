well, after falling over the bison problem..

it appears that $HTTP_SERVER_VARS is broken in ZE2 at present so I 
hacked that to $_SERVER[] - seemed ok.

the build I ran this morning halted at
php_gtk_object.c:807 'gtk_object_ce' undeclared (first use of this funciton)

that was building with
./configure --enable-pixmap --enable-scintilla

Alan

Hi,

I have just committed changes needed toi build the GtkScintilla extension
on WIn32. The dll can be downloaded from http://kromann.info/php4.php.

The extension will be included in the next release of PHP-GTK.

You're using a different (newer?) version of gtkscintilla.lib than I
have here, I think.  I have version 0.8.2 on board (using their
makefile.mak) and it's complaining about libc conflicts.

Where did you find yours?  or is it just /md'd?

Hi Steph,

I'm using GtkScintilla-0.8.2 as well but I did create a new .dsp file in
order to build thie library. You can have a copy of that file if you want
?

Hi,

This is almost the case already. I'll adjust the readme file so it matches
the current distribution.
There is no need to have php.exe in the path, but it can be nice to have,
unless you have multiple PHP directories in order to test and run
different versions.

OK, figured it out (somewhat). Seems to be a Debian issue not a PHP issue.
I took a look at the Debian package of php-gtk and they do a little work
on libtool before the build takes place.

After getting rid of the reference to 'gtkgdkpixmap.c' completely,
overriding gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() with an 'ignore', commenting out
PixbufFrameAction enums in the defs, and statically linking to a
gdkpixbuf lib I'm down to just unresolved external symbols.

There are two libs created when gdkpixbuf is built (I could of course be
using a wrong version).  The only difference in output is that the one
marked static (s version) notes a MSCVRT.dll conflict.

I think that suggesting users copy all the dll's to the system dir and worse

bad juju IMO ;)

So whats the chance of a change ?

Hi,

I do not get any of these errors, but I can be doing something wrong.
Do you have a small sample program I can use to test ?

You will need to use the complete set of binaries from my site, as these
are compiled against the latest version of GTK+ for windows. 

- Frank
&gt; I added the dll to the PHPGTK extentions in php.ini and copied to dll
to
&gt; where my php.exe is and got it loaded etc etc. However whenI try and
&gt; create a new scintilla widget I get these errors:
&gt; 
&gt; (process:1736): GLib-CRITICAL **: file ghash.c: line &lt;line_num&gt;
&gt; (g_hash_table_lookup):
&gt; assertion `hash_table != NULL' failed
&gt; 
&gt; Where &lt;line_num&gt; is 225 or 291. The error is repeated many times. I
also
&gt; get:
&gt; 
&gt; (process:1736): Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_type_create(): unknown parent type
&gt; `21'.
&gt; 
&gt; As well as many other errors.
&gt; 
&gt; The code I used to create a widget is:
&gt; 
&gt; $scintilla=new GtkScintilla();
&gt; 
&gt; Im guessing its an internal problem?

&gt; Alan,
&gt; 
&gt; Gtk2 may require a bit of a different approach in the way objects are
&gt; constructed and so on. Doing it straight on, similar to Gtk1 won't let
&gt; us take advantage of optimizations and extendibility features. I plan to
&gt; sit down and write up a plan of attack before PHP Con..

That should be feasible - not much of the current code has been altered 
much,  so far:
- added gobject to the inheritence tree
- fleshed out signal connect with closures.
- got my h2defs.php to parse all .h files from gtk2 perfectly(I hope).
- added xxx.defs.defaults (to set defaults)
- moved xxx.defs.extra (for additional defs not generated from headers)
- commented out GtkArgs-&gt;php args code.

Looking at the general requirements for Gtk2 -

a) defs file creation / overrides
b) signals/callbacks + GtkArg-&gt;GValue conversions
c) changing the base code to use GObject, rather than GtkObject. (and ?? 
examine how the objects/ze store stuff works)

I was tempted to leave the last bit alone for the moment anyway.. - The 
idea being it's nice to have a working testbed for any new Object design..

I was thinking of maybe attacking b) depending on timescale - I didnt 
think there was too much overlap in those areas.. eg. changing the 
object model may not affect too much of the existing code anyway..?

Regards
Alan

Asunto: Using GtkExtra under phpgtk


I'm starting to create plot.defs for making a GtkPlot/Canvas class...

;; -*- scheme -*-
; object definitions ...

(object Plot
  (in-module Gtk)
  (parent Widget (Gtk))
  (c-name GtkPlot)
)
(object Canvas
  (in-module Gtk)
  (parent Widget (Gtk))
  (c-name GtkCanvas)
)

(function gtk_plot_canvas_new
  (c-name gtk_plot_canvas_new)
  (is-constructor-of GtkCanvas)
  (return-type GtkWidget*)
  (parameter (type-and-name gint width))
  (parameter (type-and-name gint height))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble magnification))

)
      (function gtk_plot_new_with_size
  (c-name gtk_plot_new_with_size)
  (is-constructor-of GtkPlot)
  (return-type GtkWidget*)
  (parameter (type-and-name GdkDrawable* drawable))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble width))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble height))
)

With the canvas all is ok, I draw it in the window. But with plot I have the
next problem.
In C, gtk_plot_new_with_size is called using a NULL as GdkDrawable, but in
PHP I can't send it a Null, it claims a GtkDrawable widget.

Best Regards.
Angel Maza.

I reported this error on bugs.php.net, but there is no section for gtk, 
maybe there should be.....

Also, I have noticed that GtkExtra seems to be required (configure fails 
unless it is installed), even if it is not enabled

Hello!

I need working php-gtk2 with glade2 "for yesterday" :)
I've done some work on porting. The result is on:
http://ggodlewski.host.sk/php-gtk-0.5.2.tar.gz

I've used defs files from pygtk and modified generator.
It's done "quick&amp;dirty way" so defs have to be regenerated (I've removed
non-working functions). All the modifications in main/* and php_gtk+-types.c
should be extended - new classes aren't fully implemented, some
things are just commented.

It even works... However the signals handling has changed in gtk2 (so
it doesn't work).
Glade2 doesn't work also. It shows message:

PHP Fatal error:  Underlying object missing or of invalid type in ...
Memory Fault

Could anyone tell me what does it mean?
I would be very grateful if anybody help me fixing this two things.
It's very urgent for me.

Hello, 
let me introduce myself to you,
 
My name is Michael VERGOZ and I live in France. 


It there have 2 day ago I have be allot on the project Php-gtk 
to allow the evolution of a technology more than intresting 
because it allow with user no-inform to can create a graphic application 
stable and portable. 

One can say that the current code is a _advanced_ proof-of-concept.

I hope to succeed in making evolve this technology. 

I have a very varied knowledge : 
 - Language: 
  - C, C++, Asm x86, (some base in 68k), Flex, Yacc (bison), PHP (:P) 
 
 - Linux/Unix: - 
  - Lib: ncurses, libpq, regex, GD, glut, pcap... 
  - System: IPC, Thread, blah... 
  - Kernel hacking 
 
 - Darwin (not have Unix): 
  - Good concepts of portability 
  - Carbon, Cocao, and of another things APPLE depend, like the network API

 - Windows: 
  - WSA, APP, pixelformat, User Interface and another things... 


Devels, tell me what i have to do :P

Hi,

You can use all PHP functions with PHP-GTK. You need to make sure you have
the correct settings for mail in your php.ini file in order to use the mil
function.

Hello,
here's a patch against the sources from the 1.0.0 tarball to add the
following two functions:

int GdkWindow::get_decorations(void)
void GdkWindow::set_decorations(int decorations)

I could see from a grep that the constants needed (GDK_DECOR_*) are
defined but the functions weren't.

Inside get_decorations(), the call to gdk_window_get_decorations() is
if'ed as this function isn't defined on my system (see below [1]),
issuing the message '/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1:
/usr/ports/x11-toolkits/php-gtk/work/php-gtk-1.0.0/modules/php_gtk.so:
Undefined symbol "gdk_window_get_decorations"'. I'm not sure if #if is
correct (is there a define in GTK-versions with it?). It seems though
from a search on Google that this function exists in some versions,
therefor I added this functionality. The function returns FALSE in case
gdk_window_get_decorations doesn't exist (maybe there should be a
warning?).

For the manual:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GdkWindow::set_decorations() tries to set the decorations of a window.
The decorations argument is the logical OR of the fields in the
GdkWMDecoration enumeration. If GDK_DECOR_ALL is included in the mask,
the other bits indicate which decorations should be turned off. If
GDK_DECOR_ALL is not included, then the other bits indicate which
decorations should be turned on.

These are hints originally defined by the Motif toolkit. The window
manager can use them when determining how to decorate the window. The
hint must be set before mapping the window.
GDK_DECOR_ALL       all decorations should be applied.
GDK_DECOR_BORDER    a frame should be drawn around the window.
GDK_DECOR_RESIZEH   the frame should have resize handles.
GDK_DECOR_TITLE     a titlebar should be placed above the window.
GDK_DECOR_MENU      a button for opening a menu should be included.
GDK_DECOR_MINIMIZE  a minimize button should be included.
GDK_DECOR_MAXIMIZE  a maximize button should be included.

Note: This function needs to be called prior to the window being shown
but after it has been realized (a GdkWindow is associated with the
GtkWindow).

"libtool, automake and autoconf. The combination of libtool 1.4.2,
automake 1.4 and autoconf 2.13 is known to work; mileage may vary with
other version combinations."

I think (from memory) the biggest issue is probably autoconf - I dont
think we've ever managed to get 2.57 to work.

automake (GNU automake) 1.7.8
ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.4.3 (1.922.2.110 2002/10/23 01:39:54)
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.57

plase check you have the specified versions of autoconf, automake,
libtool etc. as specified in the manual.

&gt; well, the "father" of PHP-GTK made an tutorial, just try to compile that
&gt; codes without changes on the lastest version of PHP-GTK, you'll see that
&gt; most (if not all) doesn't work if you don't change them.

Sigh what do you want me to say. Your software doesn't work with newer
versions of autoconf. To me thats a bug which is  still valid but I get
the impression that your not going to make any effort to fix this or
offer a workaround. I guess I really didn't need to the use the app
that required php-gtk anyway. Walks away bummed.

I think (from memory) the biggest issue is probably autoconf - I dont

Andrei,

Just spent some time looking at the way the engine could handle our 
$gtkstyle-&gt;fg[XXX] = ... code.

It appears that it expects you to generate a object for fg, then add a 
dimension_read/write handler for it.

Now comes the thought..
what should this magic object be:
a extension/copy of gtkstyle, with some magic flag set for the 'fg' bit 
somewhere?
or should it just store the fg bit of the gtkstyle struct (which will 
get very messy with referecing/allocation...)

I started (read not alot) hacking it up as GtkStyleArray (without a 
constructor.. etc. )

Thoughts..

Regards
Alan

Hey,

Sorry, I haven't wrapped my brain around this yet. Just got back from a
long trip.. I was planning on starting the rewrite next week..

Hello,

Just a little mail about the php-config usage in config.m4 to detect the

overrides the --with-php-config configure settings and bork a little the

This comment from http://gtk.php.net/manual/en/installunix.php helps
(autoconf 2.58 used):
 ---- snip ----
Simple solution to PHP_GTK_ARG_ENABLE problem detailed below. This must
be added to this page and the README, please oh please!

./buildconf
aclocal
./buildconf (again!)
./configure
make
make install

I also needed to make the following change to my php.ini:
extension_dir =
/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20020429/

Once that was in place, the tests ran beautifully!

./configure: line 3665: `PHP_GTK_ARG_ENABLE(debug, whether to include

you can remove those line from the files and do "make" (it will go a bit
farther) again, but then you receive the folliwing:

/dev/php-gtk/main/php_gtk_object.c: In function `php_gtk_ret_from_value':
/dev/php-gtk/main/php_gtk_object.c:892: error: `gtk_object_ce' undeclared

Hope it helps. Thanks

Can you file it as a bug, I'm not sure if we will add it in, as the 
'team' as such is focusing on GTK2/ZE2 now.

did you want to get cvs karma and commit this? ???

&gt; Hello,
&gt; here's a patch against the sources from the 1.0.0 tarball to add the
&gt; following two functions:
&gt; 
&gt; int GdkWindow::get_decorations(void)
&gt; void GdkWindow::set_decorations(int decorations)
&gt; 
&gt; I could see from a grep that the constants needed (GDK_DECOR_*) are
&gt; defined but the functions weren't.
&gt; 
&gt; Inside get_decorations(), the call to gdk_window_get_decorations() is
&gt; if'ed as this function isn't defined on my system (see below [1]),
&gt; issuing the message '/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1:
&gt; /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/php-gtk/work/php-gtk-1.0.0/modules/php_gtk.so:
&gt; Undefined symbol "gdk_window_get_decorations"'. I'm not sure if #if is
&gt; correct (is there a define in GTK-versions with it?). It seems though
&gt; from a search on Google that this function exists in some versions,
&gt; therefor I added this functionality. The function returns FALSE in case
&gt; gdk_window_get_decorations doesn't exist (maybe there should be a
&gt; warning?).
&gt; 
&gt; For the manual:
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; GdkWindow::set_decorations() tries to set the decorations of a window.
&gt; The decorations argument is the logical OR of the fields in the
&gt; GdkWMDecoration enumeration. If GDK_DECOR_ALL is included in the mask,
&gt; the other bits indicate which decorations should be turned off. If
&gt; GDK_DECOR_ALL is not included, then the other bits indicate which
&gt; decorations should be turned on.
&gt; 
&gt; These are hints originally defined by the Motif toolkit. The window
&gt; manager can use them when determining how to decorate the window. The
&gt; hint must be set before mapping the window.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_ALL       all decorations should be applied.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_BORDER    a frame should be drawn around the window.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_RESIZEH   the frame should have resize handles.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_TITLE     a titlebar should be placed above the window.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_MENU      a button for opening a menu should be included.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_MINIMIZE  a minimize button should be included.
&gt; GDK_DECOR_MAXIMIZE  a maximize button should be included.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: This function needs to be called prior to the window being shown
&gt; but after it has been realized (a GdkWindow is associated with the
&gt; GtkWindow).

From:             cweiske at cweiske dot de
Operating system: windows xp
PHP version:      4.3.3
PHP Bug Type:     PHP-GTK related
Bug description:  node_get_cell_style doesn't work

Description:
------------
The "node_get_cell_style" of the GtkCTree widget does not work, it just
returns NULL. The same problem should apply to the GtkCList.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
dl( "php_gtk." . ( strstr( PHP_OS, "WIN") ? "dll" : "so"));
function delete_event() { return false; }
function destroy() { Gtk::main_quit(); }
$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_default_size( 200, 200);
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'destroy');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$tree	= &amp;new GtkCTree( 1, 0, array( "Style"));
$window-&gt;add( $tree);
$window-&gt;show_all();

$node	= $tree-&gt;insert_node( null, null, array( "Text"), 5, null, null,
null, null, false, false);
$nodestyle	= $tree-&gt;node_get_cell_style( $node, 0);
print_r( $nodestyle);//should be NOT null
$col1 = &amp;new GdkColor(0, 56000, 0);
$nodestyle-&gt;base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL] = $col1;
$tree-&gt;node_set_cell_style( $node, 0, $nodestyle);
Gtk::main();
?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
the cell style of the first tree cell should have a nice color

[I think what we need is a php-gtk install and configuration tool (written
in php-gtk).]

That would be ideal

But I don't see that negates the need for a standard extension regardless ,
e.g. I have an nsis based php-gtk installer (2 of them in fact (deployed
over 80,000 x to date ) and I know that there are other such installers , it
would be nice (and less confusing for total noobs) if my installer used the
same extensions as everybody else's installer .

Now I don't care who's installer peeps (and an official gtk.php.net version
would be ideal)  use as long as it gets them interested in php-gtk , the
current set-up is not good for mainstream win32 users in that I know many
otherwise 'experienced' users who get totally confused trying to start a
php-gtk application , even the samples that ship and basically just give up
before they get hooked , providing standard registry entries to allow
point-and-click covers this immediately.

[Check to see if php and php-gtk are installed. If not download and
install them.]

Something you can't do on win32 unless you have some standard method of
saying 'php-gtk is installed' , e.g. a known registry key or a known
php-gtk.ini file sitting somewhere one may expect to find it.

[And the thing with "using dos screens" does nothing have to do with
php-gtk, this would be a normal script. I'd propose the context menu
"open in dosbox", available to all php-gtk scripts. This would it make
easy to debug them if needed but requires no changes to the extension.]

I use php-gtk apps in distinctly different ways which is how I got there in
the first place though I take your point.

So regardless of what may happen in the future with a totally php-gtk based
installer whets wrong with a couple of standards now?
1) file extension (s)
2) registry entries ala HKLM/Software/php-gtk [install_dir (x:/wherever)]

Like Steph and probably most here I will still mostly use .php files for
myself .. but when I deploy (on others machines) I HAVE to give an extension
... I would rather it be one that everyone agrees with.

I am finished up phpdev5 now which is more server-oriented and for total
noobs , but its going to end up on a lot of machines ... with php-gtk as the
'installer' but still requiring nsis (or similar ) to deploy , it will leave
php-gtk on the users machine (sharing as many extensions/dll's as possible)
and to date I was going to set the pgtk and dgtk extensions for php-gtk apps
... but as I said before I don't care a kippers what they are called , but
it would be nice to use something that everyone was happy with cos I like
happy people.

... I think we have run out of useful 3 letter extensions bar rude words
which are much better expressed with 4 anyway ;)

Regards,
Simon.

fact all versions I tried) 4.3.3 only works filemtime with full path to
the file I want to check. So I patched scheme parameter to

$cache_file = "$current_dir/$defs_file.cache";


Now the cachefile is found. But there's a check for $defs_file, too. This
file is definitly not on my system. I tried in php-gtk-directory:

find -name --          and 
find -name "\-\-" 

- no results.

There's no chance for me to compile it?

This doesnt look like a valid issue:
try cd {php-gtk-source}/generator
then 

php -r 'var_dump(filemtime("../configure"));'

you should see that relative paths work ok..

do a make dist clean, then ./configure/make, look at the make output to
see what it sends to the generator:
php ../generator/generator.php ................

and run that manually at the command prompt.

Description:
------------
After times of trying to compile php-gtk I learned, that
generator/scheme.php has an error on line 101 (filemtime). In my php
(in fact all versions I tried) 4.3.3 only works filemtime with full
path to the file I want to check. So I patched scheme parameter to

&gt; Line 101:
Add
$current_dir = getcwd();
$cache_file = "$current_dir/$defs_file.cache";


Now the cachefile is found. But there's a check for $defs_file, too.
This file is definitly not on my system. I tried in php-gtk-directory:

find -name --          and 
find -name "\-\-" 

- no results.

There's no chance for me to compile it?

Greetings Mike

They are in CVS, as
http://cvs.php.net/co.php/php-gtk/ext/gtkhtml/Attic/gtkhtml.overrides_for_gtkhtml.1.1?sa=1&amp;r=1.1.2.1
http://cvs.php.net/co.php/php-gtk/ext/gtkhtml/Attic/gtkhtml.defs_for_gtkhtml.1.1?sa=1&amp;r=1.1.2.1

as the note says, since GTK1 is kind of depreciated, there isnt a real 
'good' solution for this.

Big Problem is that some distributions distribute Gtkhtml1.1, others 
only Gtkhtml1.0 - and they are not compatible...

Hopefully the 2 patches already sent to the mailing list + the rather 
hidden away references in CVS will help others...


Regards
Alan

"libtool, automake and autoconf. The combination of libtool 1.4.2,
automake 1.4 and autoconf 2.13 is known to work; mileage may vary with
other version combinations."

I think (from memory) the biggest issue is probably autoconf - I dont
think we've ever managed to get 2.57 to work.

xdebug [www.xdebug.org] works ok on unix, and there are some windows

(best of all is the backtracing..)

although generally print_r() is your best friend anyway...

Madeleine,

To launch my application I use at this time both php.exe or php_win.exe.
I move this two files locally and there is no more delay. There is no use to
move locally your dll, they can stay on your server, still you have to
update the php.ini and to put it in the good location locally.
Of course now I guess that my application is running locally and I try to
figure out a way to launch shell on my server (almost there)....

If you have any other questions....

Thanks,
Kristel.

&gt; Kristel -
&gt;
&gt; Can you elaborate on this a bit?  We are having the same problem.
&gt;
&gt; Did you have to setup the both the exe and dll's locally?
&gt;
&gt; What exactly is your command string to launch the application?
&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just to know if you have any idea on this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I run my php-gtk program on my machine (1)  and it takes max 2sec for my
&gt; &gt;first window to appear.
&gt; &gt;On an another machine(2), I mount a network drive on (1) and I run the
same
&gt; &gt;program, it takes at least 7sec for the window to appear.
&gt; &gt;After that I have the same reaction time no matter that machine I am on.
&gt; &gt;I first thougt it was the access to the database but I have the same
&gt; &gt;difference with a simple example.
&gt; &gt;I also try to relocate my dll files on (2) but it seems not to be the
&gt; &gt;problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is there a way to reduce this delay?
&gt; &gt;What is php-gtk doing? is there a way I can find out?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for your help,
&gt; &gt;Kristel

From:             loner at psknet dot com
Operating system: Windows XP
PHP version:      4.3.4
PHP Bug Type:     PHP-GTK related
Bug description:  php_win.exe failing to hide dos window

Description:
------------
While running .5.2, I could use php to correctly hide the DOS window while
running my program. 

However, when I switched to 1.0.0, php_win no longer hides it. If it try
to output something, EG, echo something, it still crashes/closes. I have
all necessary .dlls and exe's in a directory under my scripts. (\backend)
I find this easier than fully installing php. 

My whole app (and the php files I use) can be extracted using this
installer: http://www.vxgames.net/mr/downloads/TepAppSetup.exe

Expected result:
----------------
You don't need any special code, just run something normally and it won't
hide it.

Actual result:
--------------
Dos window is not hidden.

There is somekind of ahm... PHP-GTK debugger, it's really hard to know what
error we did, and some times, we need to restart all project or a entire
file need to be read line by line, are we in the assembly times ? :) i don't
think so.

For me the best debugger for PHP to locate a errors is the command line
using: php -l path/script.php to debbug GTK you can use other debuggers ...

Sorry, no resources at present to do snapshots..

cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -r GTK2 php-gtk

I've nearly got object properties working here, it should appear in CVS 
in a few weeks when I get more time.

Hello,

Just to know if you have any idea on this:

I run my php-gtk program on my machine (1)  and it takes max 2sec for my first window \
to appear. On an another machine(2), I mount a network drive on (1) and I run the \
same program, it takes at least 7sec for the window to appear.  After that I have the \
same reaction time no matter that machine I am on. I first thougt it was the access \
to the database but I have the same difference with a simple example. I also try to \
relocate my dll files on (2) but it seems not to be the problem.

Is there a way to reduce this delay?
What is php-gtk doing? is there a way I can find out?

Thanks for your help,
Kristel

well, the "father" of PHP-GTK made an tutorial, just try to compile that
codes without changes on the lastest version of PHP-GTK, you'll see that
most (if not all) doesn't work if you don't change them.

Markus is very good, but he's in no way the "father" of PHP-GTK.

The only problem I had with running _any_ of this stuff here (from version
0.0.1) was that the insert_text() function changed the amount of parameters
it needed.

This change was made on 2001-05-05, when PHP-GTK was 2 months and 4 days
old.  You're seriously telling me you have an application that won't run
because of this change?????

Steph, i think you understand me wrong, but, i'm trying to tell is that if
you get the lastest version
(as all new guys will do) and try to search google or other locations for
tutorials (cause nobody that
are starting, start at the manual, you know :), that applications will not
run :/. So i'm afraid that people
that get php-gtk (not me, not you) get this great programming language, and
get frustate because they
can't compile their older applications or older codes that teach things,
etc, etc. And we all know that
manual will not cover everything for new programmers, so, i think that we
need to make some kind of
php-gtk that do things like delphi or c++ that you get codes from Delphi 1,
and still can compile on delphi 6
or 7. I mean, people don't like to lost their codes because they are
upgrading, just look at register_globals of
PHP, they didn't remove that , they just disable in the newer versions, and
will remove in version 5 of PHP
i think this is a good thing to do.

Thomas,

I don't think that one function parameter change (ONE) dating from the
beginning of the PHP-GTK project justifies this thread. Andrei's usually
careful about BC, but that particular article - the original of which is no
longer online - was the first item anyone put online about PHP-GTK.  I
know - I edited the article.

It would be easy enough to allow for a third optional parameter that does
nothing, but there's no point in doing that if there's not a general problem
and - put it this way, in 2.5 years you're the first person to mention that
this might be a problem at all.

Where else have you found anything online that was written for earlier
versions and actually won't run under PHP-GTK 1.0?

Steph

hum, i don't know if the problem is with me, but, if you go to resources at
the gtk.php.net, many applications still doesn't run on windows, i test my
applications at home, and at home i use windows. So, i'm just telling that
php-gtk is still really stranger, cause it's some times runs some
applications and others not.

ps: Stepth , please fix your email, i try always to send messages but it
returns to me, it's my or your sever?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This change was made on 2001-05-05, when PHP-GTK was 2 months and 4
days
&gt; &gt; &gt; old.  You're seriously telling me you have an application that won't
run
&gt; &gt; &gt; because of this change?????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well, the "father" of PHP-GTK made an tutorial, just try to
&gt; &gt; compile that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; codes without changes on the lastest version of PHP-GTK,
&gt; &gt; you'll see that

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] A big delay on a remote machine


Hello,

Just to know if you have any idea on this:

I run my php-gtk program on my machine (1)  and it takes max 2sec for my
first window to appear.
On an another machine(2), I mount a network drive on (1) and I run the same
program, it takes at least 7sec for the window to appear.
After that I have the same reaction time no matter that machine I am on.
I first thougt it was the access to the database but I have the same
difference with a simple example.
I also try to relocate my dll files on (2) but it seems not to be the
problem.

Is there a way to reduce this delay?
What is php-gtk doing? is there a way I can find out?

Thanks for your help,
Kristel

Kristel -

Can you elaborate on this a bit?  We are having the same problem.

Did you have to setup the both the exe and dll's locally?

What exactly is your command string to launch the application?


thanks
Madeleine D.

Description:
------------
While running .5.2, I could use php to correctly hide the DOS window
while running my program. 

However, when I switched to 1.0.0, php_win no longer hides it. If it
try to output something, EG, echo something, it still crashes/closes. I
have all necessary .dlls and exe's in a directory under my scripts.
(\backend) I find this easier than fully installing php. 

My whole app (and the php files I use) can be extracted using this
installer: http://www.vxgames.net/mr/downloads/TepAppSetup.exe

Expected result:
----------------
You don't need any special code, just run something normally and it
won't hide it.

Actual result:
--------------
Dos window is not hidden.

&gt; hum, i don't know if the problem is with me, but, if you go to
&gt; resources at
&gt; the gtk.php.net, many applications still doesn't run on windows

Applications that don't run on windows could include anything that uses an
extension that's not portable to win32.  It has nothing whatever to do with
the code base changing, it just means a lot of devs use (and write for)
linux.

 i test my
&gt; applications at home, and at home i use windows. So, i'm just telling that
&gt; php-gtk is still really stranger, cause it's some times runs some
&gt; applications and others not.

Not in my experience..

&gt; ps: Stepth , please fix your email, i try always to send messages but it
&gt; returns to me, it's my or your sever?

 New Comment:

I think without a final 'release' version or some ability to debug on
XP  it will be imposible to diagnose or fix this.

Suspending until PHP5 &amp; PHP-GTK are actually released.

You may just try removing all the PHP &amp; PHP-GTK binaries and update
from the latest snapshots.

Although I can't find the directive in the php.ini I'm using, implicit
clone is off if you check phpinfo();  But that would only matter if I
were trying to copy an object, e.g. $window =  new GtkWindow();
$newwindow = $window; ...but I'm not doing any of that, I'm just trying
to assign a gtk widget to an object variable

Aliasing does absolutely nothing - problem still exists

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2003-09-12 23:33:23] alan_k@php.net

can you follow php4 conventsions and use aliasing? 
$class = &amp;new Window();
$this-&gt;window = &amp;new GtkWindow($type);

does it work ok then?

There is a BC flag in php.ini that is supposed to turn off/on object
cloning.. - is that set?

Description:
------------
I went to the mailing list first to make sure I wasn't losing my mind
and they assured me I'm supposed to be able to store a widget in an
object variable.  I'm using builds from http://kromann.info for php5
and php-gtk for php5

The code I'm using is very simple - it's just supposed to show a
window.  The class is below - very basic.  Here's the deal - when use
$this-&gt;window inside the newWindow method nothing happens.  The script
runs, I guess, and that's the end of it.

It seems to be impossible to assign a php-gtk widget to an object
variable, which is really, really annoying

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
dl('php_gtk.dll');

$class = new Window();
$window = $class-&gt;newWindow('main', 'Product :: Title Here');
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'destroy');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete');
$window-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();

 function delete()
 {
  return FALSE;
 }

 function destroy()
 {
  GTK::main_quit();
 }

class Window
{
 var $window;

function newWindow($name, $title, $type = GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, $width
=
NULL, $height = NULL, $position = GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER)
{
 //find height and width
 if(is_null($width))
 {
  $width = gdk::screen_width()-50;
 }
 if(is_null($height))
 {
  $height = gdk::screen_height()-100;
 }
 //create the window
 $this-&gt;window = new GtkWindow($type);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_name($name);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_title($title);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_default_size($width, $height);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_position($position);
 return $this-&gt;window;
}
}
?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
A window should appear

Actual result:
--------------
Nothing happens, no errors, the script just kind of acts like it was
run and closed.

Here's some more weirdness - php seems to be dying completely (and
silently) on

$this-&gt;window = new GtkWindow($type);

because I can't echo or print_r or var_dump anything after that call,
while before I can just fine, and I'm not getting any errors.


And if I change every occurence of $this-&gt;window to just $window and
try to do a var_dump, nothing is printed but the window appears.  If I
do a print_r on $window
I get GtkWindow Object - and the window appears properly - so the
problem is with the object variable.

All right, I'm back.. sort of. I just branched the tree to PHP_GTK_1
where all the PHP 4 related devlopment should happen. I also merged

Yes, I know about it. I traced it to a problem with ZE2 and already
emailed the engine guys about it.

Any type that is not derived from GtkObject is treated as boxed. So in
all these cases the final parameter should be 1.

I can't load the example scripts that came with PHP-GTK

I get the following error:

The procedure ... cannot be found in php4ts.dll

I have already installed PHP 4.3.3 with the Windows Installer. I have
also installed PHP-GTK with the zip file extracted to: C:\phpgtk.

If i use this command in Start/Run i get the error:

C:\phpgtk\php4\php.exe C:\phpgtk\test\gtk.php.

Can you please help me?

Reproduce code:
---------------
The hello.php file from the ZIP-package of PHP-GTK 0.52

Expected result:
----------------
An window saying 'Hello'

Actual result:
--------------
Errors

Hi developers

I am project admin of DotPHP project. See 
sourceforge.net/projects/dotphp. I have that idea. DotPHP and php-GTK 
can use same source file. DotPHP can generate HTML web page and php-
GTK normal application window. What do you think about it? 
DotPHP is full object framework with event handling. Problem is 
DotPHP haven't widgets..

The current php-gtk-ze2 code is at

http://devel.akbkhome.com/svn/index.php/php-gtk2-ze2/


A couple of things that can be done
- generating defs files:
This script takes .h files and generates them.
http://devel.akbkhome.com/svn/index.php/akpear/PHP_CGenerator/h2def.php

It still needs a bit more work to generate the defs files for gtk2 - you 
could have a go at finishing that off

the resulting defs files are in
http://devel.akbkhome.com/svn/index.php/php-gtk2-ze2/ext/gtk+/

- looking at gobject
have a look through
http://devel.akbkhome.com/svn/index.php/php-gtk2-ze2/main/php_gtk_object.c
this needs to be reworked through to start with gobject, rather than 
gtkobject.
and callbacks need to use the new GClosure structure

http://www.gnome.org/~james/language-bindings/

Let me know which bit you want to attack..

The svn stuff can be checked out from the link on the web page.

Alan

From:             auroraeosrose at hotmail dot com
Operating system: Win XP Pro SP1
PHP version:      5CVS-2003-09-12 (dev)

Bug description:  Gtk Widgets cannot be stored in Object Variables

Description:
------------
I went to the mailing list first to make sure I wasn't losing my mind and
they assured me I'm supposed to be able to store a widget in an object
variable.  I'm using builds from http://kromann.info for php5 and php-gtk
for php5

The code I'm using is very simple - it's just supposed to show a window. 
The class is below - very basic.  Here's the deal - when use $this-&gt;window
inside the newWindow method nothing happens.  The script runs, I guess,
and that's the end of it.

It seems to be impossible to assign a php-gtk widget to an object
variable, which is really, really annoying

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
dl('php_gtk.dll');

$class = new Window();
$window = $class-&gt;newWindow('main', 'Product :: Title Here');
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'destroy');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete');
$window-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();

 function delete()
 {
  return FALSE;
 }

 function destroy()
 {
  GTK::main_quit();
 }

class Window
{
 var $window;

function newWindow($name, $title, $type = GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, $width =
NULL, $height = NULL, $position = GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER)
{
 //find height and width
 if(is_null($width))
 {
  $width = gdk::screen_width()-50;
 }
 if(is_null($height))
 {
  $height = gdk::screen_height()-100;
 }
 //create the window
 $this-&gt;window = new GtkWindow($type);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_name($name);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_title($title);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_default_size($width, $height);
 $this-&gt;window-&gt;set_position($position);
 return $this-&gt;window;
}
}
?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
A window should appear

Actual result:
--------------
Nothing happens, no errors, the script just kind of acts like it was run
and closed.

Here's some more weirdness - php seems to be dying completely (and
silently) on

$this-&gt;window = new GtkWindow($type);

because I can't echo or print_r or var_dump anything after that call,
while before I can just fine, and I'm not getting any errors.


And if I change every occurence of $this-&gt;window to just $window and try
to do a var_dump, nothing is printed but the window appears.  If I do a
print_r on $window
I get GtkWindow Object - and the window appears properly - so the problem
is with the object variable.

can you follow php4 conventsions and use aliasing? 
$class = &amp;new Window();
$this-&gt;window = &amp;new GtkWindow($type);

does it work ok then?

There is a BC flag in php.ini that is supposed to turn off/on object
cloning.. - is that set?

 New Comment:

Although I can't find the directive in the php.ini I'm using, implicit
clone is off if you check phpinfo();  But that would only matter if I
were trying to copy an object, e.g. $window =  new GtkWindow();
$newwindow = $window; ...but I'm not doing any of that, I'm just trying
to assign a gtk widget to an object variable

Aliasing does absolutely nothing - problem still exists

You should be able to build with the libraries from the link you are
refering to. You need to make sure you are using GTK+1.3 though.

I'll update my homepag (http://kromann.info/php4-gtk.php) with build
instructions, and make sure the readme file is up to date as well.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to build php-gtk with MSVC.
&gt; In README.win32.txt there are some old links (some don't work) to
glib/gtk.
&gt; It doesn't build with newest libs placed on:
&gt; http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html
&gt; What libraries do you use? Could you give me any directions/links?

&gt; &gt; Greetings Again,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just thought I'd add this note in case anyway has a brainstorm about
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; problem :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Pango is actually erroring when I call it from the command line -
&gt; &gt; pango_get_width:5039): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:  and
that
&gt; is the
&gt; &gt; reason I'm not getting the output back.  Did you all have an issue
&gt; like this
&gt; &gt; with GTK 1 ?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; We don't have PHP bindings for GTK2 yet, and Pango isn't
assimilated
&gt; &gt; &gt; into GTK1.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Try the Python guys (and don't tell anyone I said so ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Greetings PHP-GTK Crew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This question does not related directly to the php-gtk project,
but
&gt; I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; hoping that you all wont mind and will perhaps be able to offer
some
&gt; &gt; &gt; advice, it would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have some c code which accesses Pango to find out what the width
&gt; is of
&gt; &gt; &gt; a given string with font and font size.  Works well when called
from
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; command line.  When I call this program from PHP (with exec) it
&gt; works,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but the output array contains no data from after the points I
&gt; initialise
&gt; &gt; &gt; a GTK object ( e.g. gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv); ).  It seems wasteful
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; write the output from the program to file, when I should be able
to
&gt; pipe
&gt; &gt; &gt; it directly into PHP, and I just thought that as Pango is part of
&gt; GTK
&gt; &gt; &gt; you guys might have an idea about what is causing the problem ....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've included the code just for fun, it really is a simple
problem,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is sure causing me a large headache.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks to all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Zitan.

Ok. hello world is kind of working.. 
http://www.akbkhome.com:81/svn/php-gtk2-0.1.tgz

One big snag however is that any usage of gtklabel (or text) causes a big segfault -&gt; \
tracing back to some internal call in expat.. - I'm not sure if it's a conflict in my \
php build.. - will have to try stripping it down (eg. no libxml2..)

If you get time to try it out.. 

test/hello.php just about works..

Alan

Its' probably 1-2 months old .. off the php-gtk tree.

I just got most of the overrides to build + defaults implemented (using 
a seperate ini file).

codes on devel.akbkhome.com

I think we need to get this into CVS.. - I'll see if  I can set up a 
branch later today on cvs.php.net for it..

&gt;&gt;GTK2 Full Status - And Instructions for helping out...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;At present, PHP-GTK for Gtk2 is a working extension to some degree.... 
&gt;&gt;On the +ve side:
&gt;&gt;- It should build against current CVS of PHP5 (eg. php-src HEAD)
&gt;&gt;- It has 1400 functions/methods auto generated from the defs file.
&gt;&gt;	(gtk1 has 1000)
&gt;&gt;- It runs a slightly modified hello.php &amp; fires up gtk.php from tests.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have just added the base code for callbacks aka
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;$obj-&gt;connect($signal...)
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Next on the TODO list:
&gt;&gt;- argumemnt parsing: - when the connect callsback, it sends argments via
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;g_closure_marshal. - these need converting into php variables.. - this 
&gt;&gt;is one of the biger changes in gtk1/gt2 - and alot of the code in 
&gt;&gt;main/gtk_object.c needs modifying to fix this..
&gt;&gt;- more testing.. - and understaning of marshalling .. - at present it 
&gt;&gt;appears to work.. - although it definatly needs more attention (eg. 
&gt;&gt;making sure it's not leaking memory somewhere..)
&gt;&gt;- GObject.. - more support for GObject in the base code.. - all Gdk &amp; 
&gt;&gt;Gtk objects are based off of GObject now.. - so It should be alot 
&gt;&gt;simpler to wrap some of the simpler objects that used to be structs..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;---------- BIG JOB - that anyone can help out with --------------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As you can guess Gtk has a huge number of widgets and methods.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The php-Gtk build process is based around automatically building the 
&gt;&gt;bindings from the C header files. - however, you can see in the gtk1 
&gt;&gt;bindings that the gtk.overrides file modifies the default behaviour for
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;a large number of widgets..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A simple example of this is GtkButton.. - the standard C code to create
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;button is
&gt;&gt;gtk_button_new();
&gt;&gt;  - this is the default constructor for the widget (NOTE THAT THERE ARE
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;NO ARGUMENTS), and is autogenerated as
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;-----------------------------
&gt;&gt;PHP_FUNCTION(gtk_button_new)
&gt;&gt;{
&gt;&gt;         GtkObject *wrapped_obj;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         NOT_STATIC_METHOD();
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "")) {
&gt;&gt;                 php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
&gt;&gt;                 return;
&gt;&gt;         }
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;         if (!wrapped_obj) {
&gt;&gt;                 php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GtkButton
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;However in gtk1 - you are able to send a parameter like

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Notice (apart from the windows #ifdefs - there is very little different
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;abou the two.. - the key difference being the reading of arguments..
&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "|s", &amp;text)) {
&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;and wheather or not it calls the method..
&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;gtk_button_new_with_label(text)
&gt;&gt;or
&gt;&gt;gtk_button_new()
&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;WHAT TO DO....
&gt;&gt;If anyone wants to help out.. all they need to do is pick an Object
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;look in gtk.overrides from current CVS, for all the methods that have 
&gt;&gt;been overridden for that object..- add the code to the end of the 
&gt;&gt;gtk.overrides in the new gtk2 version. and see if it builds..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;-- if you can get any or all of the methods for an object to build.. - 
&gt;&gt;let me know and I will add it to the new overrides file.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The current working code is at..
&gt;&gt;http://devel.akbkhome.com/php-gtk2-0.4.tgz
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Let me know if you interested in helping out.

Hi!

I'm trying to build php-gtk with MSVC.
In README.win32.txt there are some old links (some don't work) to glib/gtk.
It doesn't build with newest libs placed on:
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html
What libraries do you use? Could you give me any directions/links?

BR

Your best bet would be to mail Frank directly (fmk@php.net) - he is
responsible for the Windows builds.

I have working libraries here, but his are guaranteed 100% up to date
and mine are not.  If you don't get a response, mail me.

You need to port gtk2 first.. - otherwise the only thing you will be 
able to do is make it appear.. - no signals or objects will be available.

- Ive been slowly getting gtk2 to build  on and off in the evening .. - 
but its still quite a way from complete..

&gt; Hello!
&gt; 
&gt; I need working php-gtk2 with glade2 "for yesterday" :)
&gt; I've done some work on porting. The result is on:
&gt; http://ggodlewski.host.sk/php-gtk-0.5.2.tar.gz
&gt; 
&gt; I've used defs files from pygtk and modified generator.
&gt; It's done "quick&amp;dirty way" so defs have to be regenerated (I've removed
&gt; non-working functions). All the modifications in main/* and php_gtk+-types.c
&gt; should be extended - new classes aren't fully implemented, some
&gt; things are just commented.
&gt; 
&gt; It even works... However the signals handling has changed in gtk2 (so
&gt; it doesn't work).
&gt; Glade2 doesn't work also. It shows message:
&gt; 
&gt; PHP Fatal error:  Underlying object missing or of invalid type in ...
&gt; Memory Fault
&gt; 
&gt; Could anyone tell me what does it mean?
&gt; I would be very grateful if anybody help me fixing this two things.
&gt; It's very urgent for me.
&gt; 
&gt; BR

&gt; Try cygwin. - it's alot more reliable.

I did, and I got the same error!-)

I also tried this on my home machine, and it worked fine both ways (my
homebox is on broadband through a Linksys wireless router).

Here at work, I am sitting behind some Microsoft firewall machine; I am
guessing that it is configured to reject the incoming connection (from
the CVS server) or its timing out... I am raising the issue with local
IT support!

Thanks for your suggestion anyway!
Colin.

Wish I could, unfortunately I am stuck in the sunny UK!

Great work on PHP-GTK, incidentally. Looks like the new features of PHP5
will make binding to GTK a lot more simple (even if more typing of
keywords is required -- as long as PHP doesn't get as verbose as Java, I
don't mind):-).

Are you canvassing for help outside of the code sprint?

Hi Sjoerd

&gt; for all I now is that the component GtkTextView is not yet implemented
in PGP_GTK.
&gt; My goal is to get this REAL text editor to work with PHP script in
Linux and Windows.

This widget is part of GTK2.0.  There aren't any PHP bindings for GTK2.0
yet.

&gt; Is there anyone working on it?

See history.  The short answer's Yes, the long answer's Yes But Slowly..

ok, with a bit of help from free(1) and gdb, I finaly worked out how to 
get it working..

The first part of the patch illustrates it's usage in gtkextra to handle 
callbacks for traverse, which has 2 pointers to integers which would 
normally just be blank using the standard callback handlers.

The example does raise an interesting issue, as 2 of the arguments are 
Read/Write, but I've no idea how to deal with fetching their values at 
the end of the function call..


To define a module specific callback
a) define the C code to recieve the data
  - convert the arguments into a Hash array.
  - call php_gtk_simple_signal_callback with the right values..
b) add a line
php_gtk_register_callback(
	"GtkSheet::traverse",
	(GtkSignalFunc) php_gtk_sheet_callback_traverse);
to the initialization section of the module.

The patch
a) replaces the standard gtk_signal_connect_impl with a method that 
checks the registry before assigning the handler.
b) registers an extra global hash table to store the registry.
c) provides a php_simple_signal_callback to do all the hard work of 
guessing the callback and handling any user data.


Let me know if you can find any obvious mistakes, like not freeing 
memory (very likely)..
Regards
Alan

Hello
After executing that script:

unset($MyEx);

?&gt;

Excel is still in the memory after quiting php.
Without loading gtk it's ok.
Could anybody check/fix it?

hi Alan,

is a very good news!!!!!
if you want to try your code under red Hat 9 with php5.0.0-dev I do it
enchanted but you can do a .tar.gz file with all code?¿

Hi Alan,

Sounds great - Let me know when it's time to start working on the Win32
part of this. I have a CVS server we can use to colaborate on the
development.

GTK2 Full Status - And Instructions for helping out...


At present, PHP-GTK for Gtk2 is a working extension to some degree.... 
On the +ve side:
- It should build against current CVS of PHP5 (eg. php-src HEAD)
- It has 1400 functions/methods auto generated from the defs file.
	(gtk1 has 1000)
- It runs a slightly modified hello.php &amp; fires up gtk.php from tests.

I have just added the base code for callbacks aka $obj-&gt;connect($signal...)


Next on the TODO list:
- argumemnt parsing: - when the connect callsback, it sends argments via 
g_closure_marshal. - these need converting into php variables.. - this 
is one of the biger changes in gtk1/gt2 - and alot of the code in 
main/gtk_object.c needs modifying to fix this..
- more testing.. - and understaning of marshalling .. - at present it 
appears to work.. - although it definatly needs more attention (eg. 
making sure it's not leaking memory somewhere..)
- GObject.. - more support for GObject in the base code.. - all Gdk &amp; 
Gtk objects are based off of GObject now.. - so It should be alot 
simpler to wrap some of the simpler objects that used to be structs..

---------- BIG JOB - that anyone can help out with --------------

As you can guess Gtk has a huge number of widgets and methods.

The php-Gtk build process is based around automatically building the 
bindings from the C header files. - however, you can see in the gtk1 
bindings that the gtk.overrides file modifies the default behaviour for 
a large number of widgets..

A simple example of this is GtkButton.. - the standard C code to create 
button is
gtk_button_new();
  - this is the default constructor for the widget (NOTE THAT THERE ARE 
NO ARGUMENTS), and is autogenerated as

-----------------------------
PHP_FUNCTION(gtk_button_new)
{
         GtkObject *wrapped_obj;

         NOT_STATIC_METHOD();

         if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "")) {
                 php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
                 return;
         }

         wrapped_obj = (GtkObject *)gtk_button_new();
         if (!wrapped_obj) {
                 php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GtkButton 
object",
                                   get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));
                 php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
                 return;
         }

         php_gtk_object_init(wrapped_obj, this_ptr);

}
-----------------------------

However in gtk1 - you are able to send a parameter like
$x = new GtkButton('the label');

so the gtk_button_new code is defined in gtk.overrides as:
-------------------------------------
PHP_FUNCTION(gtk_button_new)
{
         GtkObject *wrapped_obj;
         gchar *text = NULL;
#ifdef PHP_WIN32
         gchar *utf8_text = NULL;
#endif

         NOT_STATIC_METHOD();

         if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "|s", &amp;text)) {
                 php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
                 return;
         }

         if (text) {
#ifdef PHP_WIN32
                 utf8_text = g_convert(text, strlen(text), "UTF-8", 
GTK_G(codepage), NULL, NULL, NULL);
                 wrapped_obj = (GtkObject 
*)gtk_button_new_with_label(utf8_text);
                 if (utf8_text) g_free(utf8_text);
#else
                 wrapped_obj = (GtkObject *)gtk_button_new_with_label(text);
#endif
         }
         else
                 wrapped_obj = (GtkObject *)gtk_button_new();

         if (!wrapped_obj) {
                 php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GtkButton 
object",
                                   get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));
                 php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
                 return;
         }

         php_gtk_object_init(wrapped_obj, this_ptr);
}

-------------------------------------


Notice (apart from the windows #ifdefs - there is very little different 
abou the two.. - the key difference being the reading of arguments..
-------------------------------------
if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "|s", &amp;text)) {
-------------------------------------
and wheather or not it calls the method..
-------------------------------------
gtk_button_new_with_label(text)
or
gtk_button_new()
-------------------------------------

WHAT TO DO....
If anyone wants to help out.. all they need to do is pick an Object

look in gtk.overrides from current CVS, for all the methods that have 
been overridden for that object..- add the code to the end of the 
gtk.overrides in the new gtk2 version. and see if it builds..

-- if you can get any or all of the methods for an object to build.. - 
let me know and I will add it to the new overrides file.

The current working code is at..
http://devel.akbkhome.com/php-gtk2-0.4.tgz

Let me know if you interested in helping out.

Regards
Alan

Hi Alan,

I'm trying to configure a build environment to build this on Win32 but I
noticed that the include and lib paths in the .dsp files are pointing to
php4 and not to php5. With the current CVS version pg php-gtk this should
be fixed. When did you get these files ?

I get a lot of warnings and errors at this time. Some are related to Zend
and some to TSRMLS_*, but I'll ee if I can fix them.

&gt; Gtk objects are based off of GObject now.. - so It should be alot 
&gt; simpler to wrap some of the simpler objects that used to be structs..
&gt; 
&gt; ---------- BIG JOB - that anyone can help out with --------------
&gt; 
&gt; As you can guess Gtk has a huge number of widgets and methods.
&gt; 
&gt; The php-Gtk build process is based around automatically building the 
&gt; bindings from the C header files. - however, you can see in the gtk1 
&gt; bindings that the gtk.overrides file modifies the default behaviour for

&gt; a large number of widgets..
&gt; 
&gt; A simple example of this is GtkButton.. - the standard C code to create

&gt; button is
&gt; gtk_button_new();
&gt;   - this is the default constructor for the widget (NOTE THAT THERE ARE

&gt; NO ARGUMENTS), and is autogenerated as
&gt; 
&gt; -----------------------------
&gt; PHP_FUNCTION(gtk_button_new)
&gt; {
&gt;          GtkObject *wrapped_obj;
&gt; 
&gt;          NOT_STATIC_METHOD();
&gt; 
&gt;          if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "")) {
&gt;                  php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
&gt;                  return;
&gt;          }
&gt; 
&gt;          wrapped_obj = (GtkObject *)gtk_button_new();
&gt;          if (!wrapped_obj) {
&gt;                  php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GtkButton

&gt; object",
&gt;                                    get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));
&gt;                  php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
&gt;                  return;
&gt;          }
&gt; 
&gt;          php_gtk_object_init(wrapped_obj, this_ptr);
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; -----------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; However in gtk1 - you are able to send a parameter like
&gt; $x = new GtkButton('the label');
&gt; 
&gt; so the gtk_button_new code is defined in gtk.overrides as:
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; PHP_FUNCTION(gtk_button_new)
&gt; {
&gt;          GtkObject *wrapped_obj;
&gt;          gchar *text = NULL;
&gt; #ifdef PHP_WIN32
&gt;          gchar *utf8_text = NULL;
&gt; #endif
&gt; 
&gt;          NOT_STATIC_METHOD();
&gt; 
&gt;          if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "|s", &amp;text)) {
&gt;                  php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
&gt;                  return;
&gt;          }
&gt; 
&gt;          if (text) {
&gt; #ifdef PHP_WIN32
&gt;                  utf8_text = g_convert(text, strlen(text), "UTF-8", 
&gt; GTK_G(codepage), NULL, NULL, NULL);
&gt;                  wrapped_obj = (GtkObject 
&gt; *)gtk_button_new_with_label(utf8_text);
&gt;                  if (utf8_text) g_free(utf8_text);
&gt; #else
&gt;                  wrapped_obj = (GtkObject
*)gtk_button_new_with_label(text);
&gt; #endif
&gt;          }
&gt;          else
&gt;                  wrapped_obj = (GtkObject *)gtk_button_new();
&gt; 
&gt;          if (!wrapped_obj) {
&gt;                  php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GtkButton

&gt; object",
&gt;                                    get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));
&gt;                  php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
&gt;                  return;
&gt;          }
&gt; 
&gt;          php_gtk_object_init(wrapped_obj, this_ptr);
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Notice (apart from the windows #ifdefs - there is very little different

&gt; abou the two.. - the key difference being the reading of arguments..
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "|s", &amp;text)) {
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; and wheather or not it calls the method..
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; gtk_button_new_with_label(text)
&gt; or
&gt; gtk_button_new()
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT TO DO....
&gt; If anyone wants to help out.. all they need to do is pick an Object
&gt; 
&gt; look in gtk.overrides from current CVS, for all the methods that have 
&gt; been overridden for that object..- add the code to the end of the 
&gt; gtk.overrides in the new gtk2 version. and see if it builds..
&gt; 
&gt; -- if you can get any or all of the methods for an object to build.. - 
&gt; let me know and I will add it to the new overrides file.
&gt; 
&gt; The current working code is at..
&gt; http://devel.akbkhome.com/php-gtk2-0.4.tgz
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know if you interested in helping out.

Alan,

Gtk2 may require a bit of a different approach in the way objects are
constructed and so on. Doing it straight on, similar to Gtk1 won't let
us take advantage of optimizations and extendibility features. I plan to
sit down and write up a plan of attack before PHP Con..

Hi Andrei,

Please let me know if you need any help. I have Alan's version compiling
on Win32, but still need to resolve 56 symbols. Some of these are X11
related so I plan to exclude them at first.

- Frank

P.S I'll be at PHP-CON from Monday night.

dont let it compile in anything but gtk ..
check with ./configure --help :
eg. --without-glade --without-paned ....

which version of php5 have you got? - latest cvs...?

public_html for a PHP-GTK desktop application seems unlikely..

your include_path's wrong, just correct it in your php.ini

Sorry, but your problem does not imply a bug in PHP itself.  For a
list of more appropriate places to ask for help using PHP, please
visit http://www.php.net/support.php as this bug system is not the
appropriate forum for asking support questions. 

Thank you for your interest in PHP.

One, this isn't anything to do with PHP-GTK.  Two, it's not a bug. 
Please ask for help in the appropriate forums.

- thanks -

 New Comment:

With PHP5 you can't run php-gtk 0.5.2 or slower you need the CVS
source,this source is in ZE2_PORT php-gtk.

And in http://gtk.php.net the last version of PHP-GTK is 0.5.2 this is
the last and stable version.

Description:
------------
I tried to make my php 5 work with my existing gtk which i got by
downloading from http://gtk.php.net.(Windows version 0.9b) I found out
that even after setting up all the necessary extensions in php.ini and
everything it is still not working.To make sure i copied all necessary
php-gtk .dll's in directories like /(where my php.exe
resides),/extensions,/dll's.


Now when i tried to compile my program modifying my php.ini to point to
my extension dir(extension_dir = "c:\pp\extensions\") and used the
following command

cd c:\pp
php -q -c c:\pp\test\hello.php

and the result was:
Error Parsing c:\pp\test\hello.php on line 4

And actually this "hello.php" was none written by me but something
which came with php-gtk package and my examination has revealed no
error with it.

code has been attached and line numbers have been marked untill 4.

I was wondering what went wrong?



Reproduce code:
---------------
1:&lt;?php
2:/* $Id: hello.php,v 1.6 2002/11/25 18:22:05 fmk Exp $ */
3:
4:if (!class_exists('sqlite')) {
	if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0, 3)) == 'WIN')
		dl('php_gtk.dll');
	else
		dl('php_gtk.so');

Thank you for taking the time to write to us, but this is not
a bug. Please double-check the documentation available at
http://www.php.net/manual/ and the instructions on how to report
a bug at http://bugs.php.net/how-to-report.php

As 'epplestun' said, ZE2 (PHP5) is quite a different animal from ZE1
(PHP4. The current stable PHP-GTK version (0.5.2) should be used on
win32 for the time being, as there is no ZE2_PORT binary for Windows
just yet.

Cutting edge, eh?  ;)

Dear All,

Is there a coordinated effort to produce PHP bindings for GTK2 at the
moment?

Is anyone still heading up the php-gtk project (according to the
website, that be Andrei Zmievski)?

Sorry to ask such crass newbie questions, but activity on php-gtk
appears to be quite low level at the moment...

Thanks in anticipation.
Colin.

&gt; Is there a coordinated effort to produce PHP bindings for GTK2 at the
&gt; moment?

Not really.. - the main focus (Mainly by Andrei) was getting the code to 
work with PHP5, which seems to be working now.

I've got some of the core work done for GTK2 bindings:
- updated configure
- new defs files
- modified gtk_types
however still outstanding are
- main/gtk_object*
  -- changing all the automated arg handling which uses gtkobject at 
present to gobject.
..
then whatever else stops it building....

But it's an on and off project.. - like when I have time/feel in the 
mood etc. :)

It's all sitting on a portable here.. - if anyone wants access I can 
stick it in a subversion folder and open access to it.

Regards
Alan



&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone still heading up the php-gtk project (according to the
&gt; website, that be Andrei Zmievski)?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to ask such crass newbie questions, but activity on php-gtk
&gt; appears to be quite low level at the moment...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in anticipation.
&gt; Colin.

That's good.

Well, the reason I am interested is because I have written a large
project in PHP (for requirements trace ability). Originally, it was
going to be a web application; subsequently, people have decided they
don't like the web page interface and want a proper GUI. I am hoping to
use Glade, libglade and PHP-GTK to 'quickly' produce a front-end for my
PHP/MySQL backend code.

To make things more interesting still:
it needs to run on Microsoft Windows (2000).
I am only working here for another 3 days (although I may subsequently
continue working on it part-time).

Anyway, I am interested in your (presumably PHP4) code for GTK2; please
could you make it available?

Presumably, mainstream (Andrei's :-) php-gtk development will be PHP5
coded GTK2 bindings?

Thanks for your swift reply!
Colin.

Yes, no question about it. If you are attending PHP-Con in Santa Clara,
California, you should stop by the Code Sprint session for PHP-GTK 2.

I need to give my users the ability to select a CList row with a double
click.  I've read all the online info from the manual and the list, but
must still be doing something wrong.

----------------------------------
Environment:  Winnt 4.0, sp 6i, PHP 4.2.3, Gtk 0.5.2

Current version of code:

$clist-&gt;connect("button-press-event","PMmouseClick",$src);

function PMmouseClick($widget,$event,$src)   {

    if {$event-&gt;button == 5)  {
        PMcloseWin($src);
    }

}

------

I've also tried $event-&gt;keyval to GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS. Same response.
Nothing.  What I can verify is that it gets to the function and has an
event, but never resolves to the value for double click.

I finally got around to trying to build the ze2port on doze tonight.
PHP-GTK hot out of CVS, PHP5/ZE2 about a week old, this combination
should work on *nix as far as I'm aware, please say if not.

I'm getting 12 fatal errors and 38 warnings, most of which appear to be
a direct consequence of:

..\..\ext/gtk+/php_gtk+.h(60) : error C2065: 'tsrm_ls' : undeclared
identifier
(in fact this constitutes 9 of the errors.)

The other 3 fatals are:
C:\php\php-gtk\ext\gtk+\php_gtk+_types.c(1273) : error C2198:
'add_property_long_ex' : too few actual parameters
C:\php\php-gtk\ext\gtk+\php_gtk+_types.c(1276) : error C2198:
'add_property_string_ex' : too few actual parameters
C:\php\php-gtk\ext\gtk+\php_gtk+_types.c(1278) : error C2198:
'add_property_null_ex' : too few actual parameters

- again these stem from TSRMLS_D/C/whatever being basically screwed, and
the vast majority of the warnings are close relatives.

I tried sticking extra Zend-ish defines in the .dsp, it complained - so
the paths are fine, I can't see a single reason tsrm_ls should suddenly
be meaningless, though obviously there is one :)

Anyone feel like being a hero today?

NB if it helps any, static inline definitions seem to be where it all
falls apart..

Hi there,

My name is Dave, and no ya don't know me, but I wanna tell ya about =
something.
I'll admit I got your info off a website somewhere while searching =
around
for addys on Yahoo, but this isn't spam, and i'm not adding you to any
sort of list. This email is between *me* and *you* and if you reply,
you will get a real person on the other end :-)

The site that I saw yer addy on, and I can't really recall where I saw =
it,
it had something to do with message forums and online conversation, and =
I
am also into message forums also. I don't like the flame forums tho with
all the idiots just swearing like they have nothing better to do.

I like the ones that are fun, friendly, and the people actually have =
something
intelligent to say.

Well, anywayz, I run a message forum network called Xpresit Net, and am =
trying
to premote it. We don't sell anything, and I actually run the network =
from my
DSL line at home. The site is on an OC3, but the actual mail exchange =
takes
place from the hub on my DSL line.

This is a network in light of the fact that we not only offer it to =
regular
people, but we also offer it to websites to have for their visitors.

It's a free speech network, we just don't allow flaming, because I feel =
that
any opinion can be said without attacking someone.

We have 62 servers so far, and we have telnet, web, nntp (Newsgroup), =
and email
list access to post in the network.

Since this network is privately run, there is absolutely no spam, and =
the way
it is setup, spammers can't get to it.

You can't spam via a bot on the website, with telnet its impossible to =
spam,
and with email and nntp, if anyone actually manages to send out a spam
message, their account will be blocked and removed.

I setup this network 10 years ago, starting on my 14.4 modem, if you can
beleive that :-)

Well anyways, if you are a webmaster who wants the network on your site,
or if your just a regular person looking for a friendly place to chat
with some nice people, then please visit http://www.xpresit.net

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply. If your not
interested, I'm really really sorry to have bothered you, and you
can just delete this email.

Well anywayz, thats about all i have to say about that. I hope you'll
join us. But if not thats ok too.

Have a good one, and thanks again.

Dave

technically it's all done :)

only snag is I cant get it to work...

http://www.akbkhome.com:81/svn/gtk_widgets/mozembed/
(you should be able to connect with nautilus and drag/drop the folder)

in the tests directory is a small c program, with ./build to make it.
This works perfectly (you need mozilla-1.0.0 installed)


but the identical thing in php - mozembed.php doesnt display anything.. 
- Any great ideas welcome


Regards
Alan

Andrei, attached is a patch for adding a callback registry to php-gtk, 
so that callbacks that use gpointers or other 'unhandled' types, can be 
mapped to module defined handlers.

In the example, the callback for GtkSheet::traverse is mapped to 
php_gtk_sheet_callback_traverse, rather than the default mashaller.
using
php_gtk_register_callback("GtkSheet::traverse",php_gtk_sheet_callback_traverse);

I've just modified the  gtk_signal_connect_impl function to check the 
registry (and moved it to php_gtk_object.c)

It almost works, except I guess I got a pointer wrong somewhere in the 
process, cause it dont callback to the right place at present...

any ideas why? :)

Alan

Odd, Rasmus added one over 24 hours ago now.  But you're right, it's not
appearing yet... (???!)

Asunto: Using GtkExtra under phpgtk


I'm starting to create plot.defs for making a GtkPlot/Canvas class...

;; -*- scheme -*-
; object definitions ...

(object Plot
  (in-module Gtk)
  (parent Widget (Gtk))
  (c-name GtkPlot)
)
(object Canvas
  (in-module Gtk)
  (parent Widget (Gtk))
  (c-name GtkCanvas)
)

(function gtk_plot_canvas_new
  (c-name gtk_plot_canvas_new)
  (is-constructor-of GtkCanvas)
  (return-type GtkWidget*)
  (parameter (type-and-name gint width))
  (parameter (type-and-name gint height))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble magnification))

)
      (function gtk_plot_new_with_size
  (c-name gtk_plot_new_with_size)
  (is-constructor-of GtkPlot)
  (return-type GtkWidget*)
  (parameter (type-and-name GdkDrawable* drawable))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble width))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble height))
)

With the canvas all is ok, I draw it in the window. But with plot I have the
next problem.
In C, gtk_plot_new_with_size is called using a NULL as GdkDrawable, but in
PHP I can't send it a Null, it claims a GtkDrawable widget.

Best Regards.
Angel Maza.

Just to write up what I've found so far.

(fixed the $_SERVER issue on generator)

My Makefile is getting created with     

 $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CC) $(COMMON_FLAGS) $(CFLAGS_CLEAN) 
$(EXTRA_CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ -export-dynamic
-avoid-version -prefer-pic -module -rpath $(phplibdir) $(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) 
$(shared_objects_php_gtk) $(PHPGTK_SHARED_LIBADD)

rather than
$(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CC) $(COMMON_FLAGS) $(CFLAGS_CLEAN) 
$(EXTRA_CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ -export-dynamic
-avoid-version -prefer-pic -module -rpath $(phplibdir) $(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) 
$(shared_objects_php_gtk) $(PHP_GTK_SHARED_LIBADD)

.. at present I'm just hacking the Makefile after configure.

Glade and dereferencing is having trouble

&lt;?php
define(APPDIR,'/home/alan/Projects/phpmole/');
if (!extension_loaded('gtk')) {
	dl( 'php_gtk.' . PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);
}
class test {

var $glade;
    function run() {
	$this-&gt;glade = new GladeXML(dirname(__FILE__).'/test.glade');
	$this-&gt;bind_auto_text();
	$this-&gt;bind_auto_text();
   }
    function bind_auto_text() {

/*

&lt;b&gt;Fatal error&lt;/b&gt;:  Trying to add reference to invalid object in \
&lt;b&gt;/mnt/alansdisk/src/php/php-gtk2/php-gtk/test/glade.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \
on the SECOND call..

*/
        $base = $this-&gt;glade-&gt;get_widget("entry1");
    }


}
$t = new test();
$t-&gt;run();
?&gt;

In general:

go into the php-gtk/ext directory

run
./ext_skel --widget=mygtkwidget
this will make the basic build structure.
run ../generator/h2def.py /usr/include/mygtkwidget/mygtkwidget.h &gt; 
mygtkwidget/mygtkwidget.defs
and ad dthe line
(is-constructor-of mygtkwidget)

in the definition of gtk_mygtkwidget_new

.. have a go building it.. - then slowly work out what you need to add 
to mygtkwidget.overrides to make it work..

Regards
Alan

Hi, do you have in your php_gdk_pixbuf.dll the static method new_from_file()
?¿? I think this is the error because under Linux this script works perfect
:-)

In gen_gdkpixbuf.c you have:

PHP_FUNCTION(gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file)
{
 char *filename;

 if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "s", &amp;filename))
  return;

 PHP_GTK_SEPARATE_RETURN(return_value,
php_gdk_pixbuf_new(gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(filename)));
 return;
}

And the php_gdk_pixbuf_new is:

PHP_FUNCTION(gdk_pixbuf_new)
{
    long width, height;
    zend_bool has_alpha;
    GdkPixbuf *wrapped_obj;

    NOT_STATIC_METHOD();

    if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "iib", &amp;width, &amp;height,
&amp;has_alpha)) {
        php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
        return;
    }

    wrapped_obj = (GdkPixbuf *)gdk_pixbuf_new(GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB,
(gboolean)has_alpha, 8, (int)width, (int)height);
    if (!wrapped_obj) {
        php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GdkPixbuf object",
                  get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));
        php_gtk_invalidate(this_ptr);
        return;
    }

    php_gtk_set_object(this_ptr, wrapped_obj, le_gdk_pixbuf);

}

&gt;&gt;&gt; just stuffit in the ext directory of php-gtk

Hi developers,  
  
for some reason compiling php-gtk aborts with the following error message:  
  
/usr/share/php-gtk-0.5.2/build/dynlib.mk:22:  
/usr/share/php-gtk-0.5.2//libs.mk: File or directory not found  
make: *** No rule to build »/usr/share/php-gtk-0.5.2//libs.mk«  
Exit.  
  
what am I missing or which dependency did I not fullfill??  
  
For clarification, I appended the output of the configure script, 
see below for call:  
  
./configure --enable-scintilla --enable-gtkhtml --enable-gdkpixbuf  
--prefix=/usr  
  
Please help me on with this,

Hi, you can use the ext_skel script tu build you own widgets:

./ext_skel --widget=name

This creates yor .defs .overrides .h and .c, then you edit this files
and thisis all. You can see combobutton  widget to start is very easy
:-)

All I've done is added in Frank's changes from an earlier private
exchange, added the 4 remaining guilty parties:

  gdk_pixbuf_get_from_drawable
  gdk_pixbuf_finalize
  gdk_pixbuf_render_threshold_alpha
  gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask

to 'ignore' in overrides, and PHP_GTK_API'd gdk_window_new() in both the
files that happens in (because it's also a drawable).  I should add that
the baby .dll doesn't 'see' anything in the system path and is demanding
that everything (down to and including the relevant jpeg.dll and
png.dll) be right there next to it before it stops complaining about
existing at all, I know not why.

I don't have any working gdkpixbuf scripts - if anyone with nix has a
simple one that works on their box, it'd be good to see it now - so I
just tried to create a new pixbuf object in a window (which may be wrong
in itself, but I suspect that isn't the problem somehow).

Clues, anyone?

- Steph

can you follow the skeleton config.m4, so it searches for extra.h in the 
right place?
  for x in /usr /usr/local; do
	  if test -f $x/include/gtkextra/gtkextra.h; then
		  EXTRA_DIR=$x
		 
EXTRA_INCDIR=$x/include/gtkextragtk_plotdata_newgtk_plotdata_newgtk_plotdata_newgtk_plotdata_new
    	fi
   done

   if test -z "$EXTRA_DIR"; then
     AC_MSG_ERROR(Cannot locate extra)
   fi

   EXTRA_LIBDIR=$EXTRA_DIR/lib



Also

you have gtk_plotdata_new which should be gtk_plot_data_new

after that was changed, plot.php works very nicely :)

P.S. Andrei - did you want extra and canvas in CVS?

&gt; I don't have any working gdkpixbuf scripts - if anyone with nix has a
&gt; simple one that works on their box, it'd be good to see it now - so I
&gt; just tried to create a new pixbuf object in a window (which may be wrong
&gt; in itself, but I suspect that isn't the problem somehow).
&gt;
&gt; Clues, anyone?
&gt;
&gt; - Steph

&gt; http://talks.php.net/show/kongress-gtk-csg/20 here you have a good
script to
&gt; test gdkpixbuf :-)

heh, knew I'd seen it working _somewhere_ :)

Sadly it isn't working here, tells me:
&lt;b&gt;Fatal error&lt;/b&gt;:  Call to undefined function:  new_from_file() in
&lt;b&gt;C:\php4\
test\pixbuftest.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt;

(nb this isn't - or shouldn't be - an undefined function in my book...)
