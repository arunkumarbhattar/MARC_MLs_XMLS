 &lt;title&gt;Hello World Tutorial&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;simpara&gt;
  When you begin to learn a programming language the first program
  you often write is a hello world program. So, just to fit in with
  everyone else, the first tutorial in this manual just happens to 
  be a hello world tutorial!
 &lt;/simpara&gt;
 &lt;simpara&gt;
  Throughout the tutorials we expect a reasonable grasp of PHP itself.
  The tutorials are designed to give the user an idea of how to use
  PHP-GTK and the ideas and techniques behind it.
 &lt;/simpara&gt;
 &lt;simpara&gt;
  In this tutorial we will create a simple window with the text "Hello
  World!" in it, this will give an overview of a very basic PHP-GTK application.
 &lt;/simpara&gt;
 &lt;simpara&gt;
  We will start by listing the program and will then explain each line of the \
program.  &lt;/simpara&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;PHP-GTK Hello World Program Listing&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting role="php"&gt;
if (!class_exists('gtk')) {
if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0,3) == 'WIN'))
dl('php_gtk.dll');
else
dl('php_gtk.so');
}

function delete_event()
{
    return false;
}

function shutdown()
{
    print("Shutting Down");
    Gtk::main_quit();
}

function hello()
{
    global $window;
    print "Hello World";
    $window-&gt;destory();
}

$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;connect('destory', 'shutdown');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$window-&gt;set_border_width(10);

$button = &amp;new GtkButton('Hello World!');
$button-&gt;connect('clicked', 'hello');
$window-&gt;add($button);

$window-&gt;show_all;

Gtk::main();
&lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Loading PHP-GTK&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting role="php"&gt;
if (!class_exists('gtk')) {
if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0,3) == 'WIN'))
dl('php_gtk.dll');
else
dl('php_gtk.so');
}
   &lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
These first few lines check to see if the PHP-GTK extension is
already avalible, if it isnt it loads it. This is done by the
&lt;literal&gt;dl('php_gtk.dll');&lt;/literal&gt; or
&lt;literal&gt;dl('php_gtk.so');&lt;/literal&gt; statements on Windows and Linux
respecitvely.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The delete_event() Function&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting&gt;
function delete_event()
{
    return false;
}
&lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
The &lt;literal&gt;delete_event()&lt;/literal&gt; function is registered as a handler
(see below) for the &lt;signalname&gt;delete-event&lt;/signalname&gt; signal. It returns
&lt;literal&gt;false&lt;/literal&gt; telling PHP-GTK to continue with the event's
occurance. If the function was to return &lt;literal&gt;true&lt;/literal&gt; PHP-GTK
would stop the events handling there.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The shutdown() function&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting&gt;
function shutdown()
{
    print("Shutting Down");
    Gtk::main_quit();
}
   &lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
The &lt;literal&gt;shutdown()&lt;/literal&gt; function is registered as a handler for
the &lt;signalname&gt;shutdown&lt;/signalname&gt; signal. The function prints the text
&lt;literal&gt;"Shutting Down"&lt;/literal&gt; to the console and then calls the static
function Gtk::&lt;function&gt;main_quit&lt;/function&gt;.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The hello() function&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting&gt;
function hello()
{
    global $window;
    print "Hello World";
    $window-&gt;destory();
} 
&lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
The &lt;literal&gt;hello()&lt;/literal&gt; function is registered as a handler for the
&lt;signalname&gt;clicked&lt;/signalname&gt; signal on the button. It globalises the
&lt;literal&gt;$window&lt;/literal&gt; variable so it can access the instance of
&lt;classname&gt;GtkWindow&lt;/classname&gt; created further down the script. It then
prints the text "&lt;literal&gt;Hello World&lt;/literal&gt;" to the console, it then
destroy's the window, this fires the &lt;signalname&gt;destory&lt;/signalname&gt; 
signal.
&lt;/para&gt;
 &lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Setting up the Window&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting&gt;
$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;connect('destory', 'shutdown');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$window-&gt;set_border_width(10);
&lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
The next four lines set up the window itself. Firstly we create an instance
of &lt;classname&gt;GtkWindow&lt;/classname&gt;, once this has been done successfully we
call the &lt;function class="GtkObject"&gt;connect&lt;/function&gt; to register the
&lt;literal&gt;shutdown&lt;/literal&gt; function as the handler for the
&lt;signalname&gt;destory&lt;/signalname&gt; signal and the
&lt;literal&gt;delete_event&lt;/literal&gt; function as the handler for the
&lt;signalname&gt;delete-event&lt;/signalname&gt; signal. Finally we call the
&lt;function class="GtkContainer"&gt;set_border_width&lt;/function&gt; function to set up
the border on the instance of &lt;classname&gt;GtkWindow&lt;/classname&gt; we just
created.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Setting up the Button&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting role="php"&gt; 
$button = &amp;new GtkButton('Hello World!');
$button-&gt;connect('clicked', 'hello');
$window-&gt;add($button);

$window-&gt;show_all;
   &lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
These three lines of the script create and setup the button. In the first
line of the above code snippet we create a new instance of the
&lt;classname&gt;GtkButton&lt;/classname&gt; class, the argument to the constructor is
the text we want the button to display, in our case, 
"&lt;literal&gt;Hello World!&lt;/literal&gt;". We then call the 
&lt;function class="GtkObject"&gt;connect&lt;/function&gt; function to register the
&lt;literal&gt;hello&lt;/literal&gt; function we defined earlier as the handler for
the &lt;signalname&gt;clicked&lt;/signalname&gt; signal. FInally we add the button to
the window we previously created by calling
&lt;classname&gt;GtkWindow&lt;/classname&gt;'s 
&lt;function class="GtkContainer"&gt;add&lt;/function&gt; function and then display the
whole lot by calling the window's 
&lt;function class="GtkWidget"&gt;show_all&lt;/function&gt; function.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The call to Gtk::main&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;programlisting role="php"&gt;
Gtk::main();
   &lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
The final line of the script calls the &lt;function&gt;main&lt;/function&gt; function,
this tells PHP-GTK that we have finished setting up the window and to start
looping waiting for user interaction to fire events so the callback
functions we defined earlier will be called and the various actions
carried out.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;

Tee hee..... automated SPAM to be sure, but still kinda funny considering

I'm not too sure which list this question truly belongs in, so I'm sending 
to both:)  Has anyone else experienced problems with the php_win.exe file 
contained in the 0.1a distribution?  Both myself and an individual I've 
been corresponding with recently have been unable to get it to work 
properly.  Specifically, calling it on any file (including the samples in 
the distro) produces no output.  The console window's title changes for a 
spilt second and the command prompt reappears.  I'm don't know the full 
details of the other guy's system, but I do know he's running Win98 
SE.  For myself, it's Win2K Pro SP 2.  Any ideas?  Frank?

No, no relationship to GtkContainer. $node-&gt;children is simply a list of 
that node's children nodes, no relation to widgets.

Although it might not be completely correct to add two VBoxes to a window,
it shouldn't give such error.

Sorry Sander, it should give that error.

Only one child per bin, and window derives from bin.

$vbox=&amp;new GtkVBox();
$window-&gt;add($vbox);
$vbox2=&amp;new GtkVBox();
$window-&gt;add($vbox2); // comment out this line
                      file://and the error disappears
$window-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();
?&gt;

Although it might not be completely correct to add two VBoxes to a window,
it shouldn't give such error.

Playing around with self made extension I get the error
'Underlying object missing' missing. That happens after the
constructor is successfully called.

What are the generell precautions to be taken to get objects
up&amp;running under php-gtk?

had a look at draw_polygon - this version uses a array eg. 
(1,0,2,0,2,2,1,2) etc. to create the polygon..
 - the overhead to create a 'point object' for 'x,y' seemed a bit much..
I guess it could also do

note that there is no error checking on the array reading.. 
I think the code could be fitted into gen_types.php reasonably easily..

I am not quite sure if we should take this approach or just use GdkPoint
objects. This way may be a bit more efficient.. but.. What do others
think?

I've checked some sources .. most of them never use GdkPoint
natively and always construct an array of GdkPoint only to pass
it to draw_polygon(). So, the use of a flat array is not only
efficient but also the easiest way to use it.

And .. if we really need it otherwise, implementing it is
trivial.

So, thats a +1 from me (but only with propery error checking!).

Sure it is, but what about backwards compatibility?

Speaking as a lowly user ... I find flat arrays a lot easier to code.

Yes, but you'll have to do those checks on every call, affecting the
performance.

Don't forget the userbase.  People come onto here 3 minutes after learning html, the more intuitive the better for them.

&gt; Yes, but you'll have to do those checks on every call, affecting the

So ... what now? Is it ever of any use to use GdkPoint?

So we have

1 [ ] array(x1,y1,x2,y2...

3 [ ] array(new GdkPoint(x1,y1), new GdkPoint(x2,y2) ...

I agree with you, but I think it should be more orientated to creating a

intuitiveness.  I think that most people won't have too much trouble 
figuring it all out as long an relatively simple example exists.... in 
gtk.php in the sample that come with the distro for example and the manual

&gt;$node-&gt;children; implies that GtkCTreeNodet has some relationship with

No, no relationship to GtkContainer. $node-&gt;children is simply a list of 
that node's children nodes, no relation to widgets.

Hi Markus,

The property gutter_size is not available on win32 so you need to remove thise lines \
from the generated file before compilation.

The other error is more tricky. For some reson MSVC converts gdk_draw_pixmap to \
gdk_draw_drawable. You can fix this by replacing PHP_FUNCTION(gdk_draw_pixmap) with \
PHP_FUNCTION(gdk_draw_pixmap1) and PHP_FN(gdk_draw_pixmap) with \
PHP_FN(gdk_draw_pixmap1).

As soon as I have found a solution for these things I'll commit the fix'es

- Frank

&gt; Attached is the MSVC output ... I remember seeing this but I'm
&gt; not sure wether or not and if what the fix was ...

&gt; Can you give some examples? I think all constructors have
&gt; php_gtk_invalidate() in them..

gtk_item_factory_new
gtk_adjustment_new
gtk_tooltips_new
gtk_vseparator_new
gtk_hseparator_new
gtk_vruler_new
gtk_hruler_new
gtk_vscrollbar_new
gtk_hscrollbar_new
gtk_vscale_new
gtk_hscale_new
gtk_progress_bar_new_with_adjustment
gtk_preview_new
gtk_pixmap_new
gtk_arrow_new
gtk_label_new
gtk_accel_label_new
gtk_text_new
gtk_entry_new
[..]

Err, I stopped now, the file was still at 39% only.


They have php_gtk_invalidate() but not in this if:

    if (!wrapped_obj) {
        php_error(E_WARNING, "%s(): could not create GtkEntry object",
                  get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));
        return;
    }

There it's missing everywhere.

I agree with you, but I think it should be more orientated to creating a 
balance of intuitiveness and proper functionality than pure 
intuitiveness.  I think that most people won't have too much trouble 
figuring it all out as long an relatively simple example exists.... in 
gtk.php in the sample that come with the distro for example and the manual 
errata when that comes into being.  If all else fails, they can post to the 
mailing-list and I'm sure one of the great folks in the community can sort 
them out toute suite:)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean exactly? We can alway detect what kind of array

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, but you'll have to do those checks on every call, affecting the
&gt; &gt; performance.
&gt;
&gt;So ... what now? Is it ever of any use to use GdkPoint?
&gt;
&gt;So we have
&gt;
&gt;1 [ ] array(x1,y1,x2,y2...
&gt;2 [ ] $points[0][X] = ....
&gt;3 [ ] array(new GdkPoint(x1,y1), new GdkPoint(x2,y2) ...

&gt;Hmm .. 2) seems very appealing too ...

Andrei,

	Attached is a patch that implements clist-&gt;get_pixtext. I don't
know if it's 'right', I basically copied the gtk_ctree_node_get_pixtext
function.

Hy,
i just managed to generate the first german doc files.

After having solved the problem with the umlauts
there was a problem with entities to which was pointed to
by the files reference.xml, tutorial.xml and userguide.xml.

I Just commented out those entities mentioned there without
an appriate xml file in the corresponding folder, and there it goes.


I am thinking about changing the Makefile so that the docs
for a specific language will be generated in build/$LANG/html
and so on. Is that okay or will that cause problems anywhere?

It's a good idea, but I want to check with Jim because it might affect
auto-generation of docs.

Jim, is this change likely to break something in the daily builds?

Is there anyway we can get a bug-tracker going - php.net's one?.. - but 
posting to php-gtk-dev (and probably not to php-dev )?

It would be usefull as I need a reminder of all the bugs on gtkhtml -
 from what I remember
 - check if gconf_init() is really needed
 - remove overkill of editor_api get variables
 - work out what calls are needed to select an image.
 - remove 'hack' enums

There are ruffelings in our rewrite of php.net's bug tracker but its slow..
I might get some time at some point to do more work on it but the current
one works fine for the moment tbh. Lets just use a new installation of that
rather than anything else then if we do get round to it it is a lot easier
to deal with the transition from the old one to the new one.. Do we really
need/want a bug tracker yet though??

yep, but we can change the build scripts if that's the way the
php-gtk-doc folks want to handle it.

(the way things are currently set up, you can just create a new
directory, run ~path/to/php-gtk-doc/configure and it will build into
that new directory. this makes it possible to have multiple build trees
set up that use the same source tree.)

well, the ability to build outside of the source tree is a basic
requirement for the automatic manual building (so that we don't have to
make an extra copy of the tree, and no cruft is left around from each
build that could screw up the next).

building into different trees within the build tree, based on language,
doesn't matter to me. it won't hurt, except for the few seconds it will
take to update the automated build scripts to deal with it.

Okay, that'd be great then. Let's build into different subdirectories of 
build directory. Jim, can you update the automated scripts and, Henning, 
you can modify the Makefile now.

The attached patch just adds @'s to the lines that are giving warnings - 
ofcourse the warnings end up in the source code (gdkpixbuf) - and the 
build fails..

not sure if they are intentional checks or accidental though.

    http://guru.josefine.at/~mfischer/tmp/tmppics/widgets.html

    Andrei, these are the ones I can commit. They're all
    self-containing (right word?), i.e. they're all coming with
    their sources too. I don't have the urls for all them right
    now but I plan to commit a README file for every widget to
    also note who its original author is and where to get it from
    just in case.

    comments?

Um, we discussed this a while ago, Frank, remember? We used to have them
BYREF_FORCE, but we decided to use the array-return mechanism.

    We have gtk function

        gtk_foo_bar_get(GtkSomeObject *obj, gdouble *x, gdouble *y);

    While working on gtkextra I found quite a lot of them. They
    just return the values to x and y, e.g in gtk_foo_bar_get():

        void gtk_foo_bar_get(GtkSomeObject *obj, gdouble *x, gdouble *y)
        {
            *x = obj-&gt;blabla.x;
            *y = obj-&gt;blabla.y;
        }

    First I wanted to create an extra Retval_Arg handler. Alan
    suggested using another flag to the parameters 'return-value'

(method get_position
  (of-object Plot (Gtk))
  (c-name gtk_plot_get_position)
  (return-type none)
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble* x) (return-value))
  (parameter (type-and-name gdouble* y) (return-value))
)

    Assuming the the function has NO return value the,
    the return code would look like:

        gtk_foo_bar_get(GTK_FOO_BAR(PHP_GTK_GET(this_ptr)), &amp;x, &amp;y);

        array_init(return_value);
        add_next_index_double(x);
        add_next_index_double(y);

    I've played around and it works fine. But before I put
    more energy into this I wanted to know if everyone agrees
    witht his solution. It requires changes to the code generator
    in several places.

    Alan, Andrei, anyone?

as 4.1.0 finally made it out the door today !

whats left to do before releasing php-gtk 0.1.2??? = the extension 
overload????

Pixbuf:
It would be good to get the $pixbuf-&gt;render_pixmap_and_bitmap() I sent 
in the other day - as I'm using it  :)

Gtkhtml:
Could still do with tidying up a bit - although at present - dont fix 
what isnt broken?
I also wanted to get image selection working, but that may have to wait..

Scintilla:
That folding bug is really annoying - GtkScintilla's under GPL and 
Scintillas under a similar - free for all copying  - Can we put the 
modified tarball into the php-gtk site, and modify php-scintilla so it 
only works with that tarball? - I cant see Michele updating his page in 
the near future.... - would that help the window port? - having the 
modified code??

Gtk/Gdk
Anyone one to add anything?

Windows?
Any updates?....

&gt; Hi Andrei,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Um, we discussed this a while ago, Frank, remember? We used to have them
&gt; &gt; BYREF_FORCE, but we decided to use the array-return mechanism.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I remember that, and I still think it is best to keep parameter lists close to \
&gt; the documentation. 
&gt; I dont remember why we removed the code, but for some reson you were unhappy with \
&gt; using the BYREF stuff ? 
&gt; Returning as arrays is a nuce clean way to deal with this and I can accept that \
&gt; too.

Here is the discussion we had:

man cvs :)

You can set watches in cvs on some files you choose,
that is, AFAIK, something like that cvs will tell you if someone changed that
file or otherwise worked on it...

But I don't know enough about this to know how this can break up
a repository...

Hy and merry x-mas to all of You, too!
No, i won't be completely done until january, but i come further - only these
days i lost my internet connection as at home our roomate went out taking the
phone line with them and my employer decided to close cvs connections to the
outer world on the firewall.

I could need someone i can send my files to, to put them into cvs for me until
those problems are solved (phone line will be in back in the next 4 weeks, i
hope).

Maybe the GTK Section of the reference will be finished this week...

cheers,
henning

    Sure I can read, it was just a joke merely. The interesting
    question is still why it breaks and what has broken. And why
    there's no trace, etc. It would be worse if one of us got
    compromised (since I never used watch, I hardly believe I did
    it, but you never know ...).

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] child_type()


.. is another GtkContainer method without any apparent purpose in life.  It always \
returns either 39701 or 1 and is a complete mystery to me.

Any clues, anyone, or does it get added to the list of 'prolly only used internally \
so let's get slimline' stuff?

Yes. Which is not really possible, because the parameters are note marked 
as in, out, or in/out.

    I've looked at the URL steph posten. The new defs format has
    a complete different syntax than the current we use. So what
    would be wrong in changind its syntax as long as we're using
    gtkv1.x anyway?

I guess not too much, as long as you don't need to regenerate .defs
files. I'd suggest making it something like:

(parameter (field-and-name gchar *foo) (type out))

And if (type out) is missing, assume it's an 'in' parameter.

Okay. That's just how parameters are marked in languages such as IDL,
usually. In, out, or in/out.

caught james on #gnome - it's in the spec for defs2

(parameters
    '("/arg-type/" "/arg-name/" [ "/access/" ] [ (default "/default-val/") ] [ (null-ok) ])
    ...
  )

eg.

(parameters 
    '("GdkColormap*" "cmap" "in")
  )

he hasnt defined it - other than this example - but his response was : 
in, out or inout
where the suggested values.

    If you proove now that the current code generator will work
    with the new def format ... ;)

    I see it that the code generator has to be rewritten anyway.
    I've now nearly finished for every arg_type I needed it for
    to recognize type out.

    We can later change it anyway.

Really boring and very small request - would someone please make that final parameter in GtkTooltips optional prior to the next release?  I know it's niggly, but at present what we have there isn't very intuitive to use.

nb I tried to write this patch ages ago and never heard any more of it so assume I messed up (Andrei?)

Really boring and very small request - would someone please make that final parameter \
in GtkTooltips optional prior to the next release?  I know it's niggly, but at \
present what we have there isn't very intuitive to use.

nb I tried to write this patch ages ago and never heard any more of it so assume I \
messed up (Andrei?)

Generally, I don't like to add any non-standard stuff to .defs files.
I've emailed language-bindings list to see whether in/out tag can be
added to parameter definitions for next defs version. Then we could
easily do this.

For now, I'd still say hand-code those, or modify generator temporarily,
generate code, and then copy-paste it into .overrides.

&gt;     We have gtk function

&gt; 
&gt;     While working on gtkextra I found quite a lot of them. They
&gt;     just return the values to x and y, e.g in gtk_foo_bar_get():
&gt; 
&gt;         void gtk_foo_bar_get(GtkSomeObject *obj, gdouble *x, gdouble *y)
&gt;         {
&gt;             *x = obj-&gt;blabla.x;
&gt;             *y = obj-&gt;blabla.y;
&gt;         }
&gt; 
&gt;     First I wanted to create an extra Retval_Arg handler. Alan
&gt;     suggested using another flag to the parameters 'return-value'
&gt; 
&gt; (method get_position
&gt;   (of-object Plot (Gtk))
&gt;   (c-name gtk_plot_get_position)
&gt;   (return-type none)
&gt;   (parameter (type-and-name gdouble* x) (return-value))
&gt;   (parameter (type-and-name gdouble* y) (return-value))
&gt; )
&gt; 
&gt;     Assuming the the function has NO return value the,
&gt;     the return code would look like:
&gt; 
&gt;         gtk_foo_bar_get(GTK_FOO_BAR(PHP_GTK_GET(this_ptr)), &amp;x, &amp;y);
&gt; 
&gt;         array_init(return_value);
&gt;         add_next_index_double(x);
&gt;         add_next_index_double(y);
&gt; 
&gt;     I've played around and it works fine. But before I put
&gt;     more energy into this I wanted to know if everyone agrees
&gt;     witht his solution. It requires changes to the code generator
&gt;     in several places.

    I was aware about effort to standardize those formats and to
    cover all possible things but also got he impression it
    stalled. What is the current status about the progress? Can
    we expect to see some new version soon or better not count on
    it? (Probably not before gtkv2 I guess).

    Ok, if you wan't to be so strictly tied to some (official?)
    defs format I see no point in even modifying the generator
    temporarely because it would be one-time benefit only and no
    gain at all. I'll override them all then.

    Can I now savely assume to return an array for I/O parameters?

    Ah, I remember. But I don't remmeber mentioning it :)

    I was already looking into GtkExtra but 'porting' the whole
    thing takes too much time for me right now. I played around
    extracting only certain widgets which works but IMHO it turned
    out to be a stupid and redundant idea.

    The link you posted seems like a v3 defs format. But you
    still can generate from the gtkextra header files so its no
    problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gnumeric entry pad - this one would be nice...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; No ..? But why not. It's just hard to find pieces. Most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; them I took of some page at gnome.org which lists custom
&gt; &gt; &gt; widgets.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have any urls?

Hi Alan,

Adding @ is not fixing anything, just hiding a warning.

I think the right way to patch would be to fix the code that causes the warning.

- Frank

&gt; The attached patch just adds @'s to the lines that are giving warnings - 
&gt; ofcourse the warnings end up in the source code (gdkpixbuf) - and the 
&gt; build fails..
&gt; 
&gt; not sure if they are intentional checks or accidental though.
&gt; 
&gt; regards
&gt; alan

list($pixmap, $mask) = $pixbuf-&gt;render_pixmap_and_mask($anynumber);
always seems to return NULL as $mask,

In the code I've got, I'm using the pixmap to show a mini image of a png,

using $clist-&gt;set_pixmap(0,$line,$pixmap,$mask);

now since $mask is NULL, set_pixmap will not render the image as

if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "iiOO", &amp;row, &amp;column, &amp;pixmap, 
gdk_pixmap_ce, &amp;mask, gdk_bitmap_ce))
        return;

will always work out that mask is NULL and return.
before doing the call. - if I send a dummy $mask, and force a NULL value 
below, it works OK.

/* gtk_clist_set_pixmap(GTK_CLIST(PHP_GTK_GET(this_ptr)), (gint)row, 
(gint)column, PHP_GDK_PIXMAP_GET(pixmap), PHP_GDK_BITMAP_GET(mask)); */
        gtk_clist_set_pixmap(GTK_CLIST(PHP_GTK_GET(this_ptr)), 
(gint)row, (gint)column, PHP_GDK_PIXMAP_GET(pixmap), NULL);
   
now, from what I gather - it is perfectly acceptable to send NULL as the 
mask to gtk_clist_set_pixmap -
 Should this function be moved to gtk.overrides? - and changed to 
something like

ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "iiO(O)", &amp;row, &amp;column, ........

or can you think of a better way to do it?

alan

No, I'd rather turn down error_reporting temporarily during script's

    Hi,

    as you have probably noticed I've commited a few widgets to the
    repository. I've also added simple examples in test/ which
    should work out of the box. You don't need any additional
    parameter to ./configure because all the widgets are
    self-containing and include not only the necessary source to
    bind them to PHP-GTK but also the widget source(s) itself.
    This is due the fact those widgets aren't really available as
    shared libs on any platform.

    Don't hesitate to contact me if you find something you think
    what may be a bug but please bear in mind that generating the
    bindings for these widgets is one thing, writen application
    with it another one ;)

    Win32 support isn't available yet.

But i start to see some light at the end of the tunnel...

That means i can go on translating or doing website things these days,

I did not already started to install a test system for the website

as some of you may have noticed over the last few days, a new method of 
spam protection has been implemented on lists.php.net.

if you post to one of the lists.php.net lists (via mail or the news
server at news.php.net) from a mail address that is not subscribed to
the mailing list, you will receive an email with information on how to 
confirm that you are a real person trying to send mail to the list, and 
not just some drive-by spammer. once you have responded to the 
confirmation, your original message to the list will be let through to 
the list, and your email address will be stored as one that is allowed 
to post so that future postings from you to any of the lists.php.net 
lists will be passed through without requiring confirmation.

note that this means it is no longer possible to post to the list using
an invalid smtp sender (or using an invalid email address in the 'From'
header of a post via the news server).

if you encounter problems posting to the list, feel free to drop a note 
to the list administrators at php-list-admin@lists.php.net.

Sorry, only just home (busy few days).

Yep, just that one, thanks :)  I discussed implementing gtk_tooltips_data_get() with \
Andrei some weeks back.  It would involve exposing the struct for GtkTooltipsData \
which we don't currently have full access to, and which A feels strongly that we \
don't need to have access to.  I was arguing that there was no other means to pull \
back any private tips that might be set, but actually he's right and there is (and \
it's demo'd in the gtk.php script, darnit :-\) so I have no case.

*But* it's definitely irritating having to put '' every time you want to pass a null \
string in set_tip(), which would be most of the time for most PHP-GTK users....

&gt; 
&gt; Um, we discussed this a while ago, Frank, remember? We used to have them
&gt; BYREF_FORCE, but we decided to use the array-return mechanism.

    =)

    If that will not change I'm more than happy because I've
    already rewritten the code generator to return arrays for
    boolean, ints and floats.

The new defs format is meant to be used with Gtk 2.x primarily.

&gt;     defs format I see no point in even modifying the generator
&gt;     temporarely because it would be one-time benefit only and no
&gt;     gain at all. I'll override them all then.

That's not what I meant. :) Modify the generator, then use it to generate C 
code that you'll be able to paste into .overrides. This way you avoid 
having to do them manually.

&gt;     Can I now savely assume to return an array for I/O parameters?

Yes.

&gt; you mean they didn't fix the bug in the latest release?
&gt; 
ooh the fun I have - managed to update the bindings etc.

An updated version of the bindings (based on scintilla 1.4.1) is 
available at

http://www.akbkhome.com/attachment/e734103d46be96da3213acd005cf4bf1/95c484f71332edd25ac827912f2feddd/GtkScintilla-0.8.0.tgz


it also fixes a few minor bugs...

Hello,

Despite I already created this list a long time ago, only now I am
announcing it as a general purpose forum for discussing matters related
with Object Oriented Programming done in PHP.

Everybody is invited and to join all you need to do is to send a message
to php-objects-subscribe@yahoogroups.com or go to the page
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/php-objects/ . If you send the message to
the above address I think you do not need to have a Yahoo account if you
don't have one and don't want to subscribe to it.

Hi All,

That is "Merry Christmas" in Danish.

Benjamin is sitting on my left arm, sleeping :-) and my inlaws are visiting from \

Hello,

If you are reading this and do not know what is Metabase, be aware that
it is PHP database abstraction package for developing truely portable
database independent functions. Metabase development will complete 3
years next week. This is a lot of time in the software development
world. More information available in the usual place:
http://phpclasses.UpperDesign.com/browse.html/package/20 

Despite my baby son is monopolizing almost all my free time (I am not
complaining :-) ) I finally made time to clean up Metabase API and
document a OOP API that is alternative to the Metabase* global functions
API, so that now you can use Metabase functions using direct calls to
driver class objects.

This API has always been available but it was never documented because
to enable it, I needed to use a syntax that would break under PHP 3.
Finally I realized that I could use eval() to work around that problem
and Metabase provides this OOP direct to driver function API preserving
backwards compatibility to not affect the applications of those that for
some reason still need to use PHP 3. I know that some people that use
Metabase still have to use PHP 3 and I simpathize with their
constraints.

Anyway, finally OOP fans should have no more excuses for not adopting
Metabase as their PHP database abstraction of choice.

If you thought that typing MetabaseQuery($database,"Select * from zbr");
would make an hell of difference when compared to $db-&gt;Query("Select *
from zbr"); you should please now with Metabase with this symbolic
Christmas gift.

Also the performance fanatics should have one less excuse for not using
Metabase for some so claimed significant overhead that Metabase global
functions add to driver function calls.

Soon I will also be adding functions for fetching row data in bulk
contributed by Lukas Smith that is giving up his own database
abstraction package for Metabase, contributing to make the best that PHP
community deserve.

More innovating developments will follow. Enjoy. :-)

Merry X-mas,
Manuel Lemos

Sorry chaps, but I'm getting that self-same error when the 'move-current' signal is \
emitted too.  I can only get this signal to fire *at all* using arrow keys, which is \
weird cos it's not bound to keys (the other signal was).

Test script below because I'm due back at work in 5 minutes and don't want to fight \
with attachments not working ;)  Please could someone run it on *nix and say whether \
the program aborts when running through the 'File' menu with arrow keys there too?

- scuse scrappiness, I've used the same couple of scripts for all menushell function \
and signal testing so they're all over the place - oh and ps, if anyone can figure \
what the smeg 'move-current' signal is *supposed* to do and when it's meant to fire, \
I'll buy them sweeties :)

** ERROR ** file D:\php\php_gtk\main\php_gtk_object.c line 981: should not be reached \

on the dos screen I got
'Test' was selected from the menu.

abnormal program termination
C:\php4\dev\menu2.php has been running

I achieved this by running:
$filemenu-&gt;connect('activate-current', 'test_selected');

I get the same result with return key or spacebar.

The function is no big deal:
function test_selected() {
 echo "'Test' was selected from the menu.\n";
 flush();
}

Any daylight, Frank?

&gt; 
&gt; Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;building into different trees within the build tree, based on language,
&gt; &gt;&gt;doesn't matter to me. it won't hurt, except for the few seconds it will
&gt; &gt;&gt;take to update the automated build scripts to deal with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, that'd be great then. Let's build into different subdirectories of 
&gt; build directory. Jim, can you update the automated scripts and, Henning, 
&gt; you can modify the Makefile now.

building into build/$LANG directory works fine for
bigmanual.html with a small modification of the Makefile

but when for buidling the manual with multiple chunks
the file stylesheets/html/chunk.xsl is used,
the place where the chunks are build is hardcoded in there.

There are Multiple solutions to this:

- dynamically generate the chunk.xsl within the configure Script
  from an chunk.xsl.in file
  and making it point to the "right" language build dir

- making a copy of the chunk.xsl as chunk.$lang.xsl in the stylesheets/html
  directory for each language and changing the makefile that
  it would use the appropriate chunk.xsl.

I think first possibility is best, but I wonder where I have to place
the generated chunk.xsl and the .in file it is generated from
as the stylesheets used are not part of the cvs tree.

Does the chunk.xsl.in then belong to James' GTK Stylesheet
package or do i have to put it into the cvs tree?
   
Would it not be better to have the stylesheets in cvs, too?

In Fact, I tried to build the manual from outside the tree like
Jim described, but it didn't work at all,
the configure script stops with loads of missing files

How about updating the mailing list search box (at the top of the

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] Can't build php-gtk


&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I was willing to build php-gtk with PHP 4.0.6 under SuSE-Linux but every
&gt; version that I got has all sorts of problems. I wonder if anybody has an
&gt; idea of what is the matter. I tried the 0.1.1 and the latest CVS to see
&gt; if anything has been fixed. At the end of this message follows the build
&gt; steps captured with the script command. Version 0.1 also does not seem
&gt; to build with the same problems.
&gt; 
&gt; I also managed to build version 0.0.2 after hacking config_vars.mk to
&gt; add gtk-config --cflags that for some reason where not being added, but
&gt; when I tried to run test/gtk.php it exit with the error below. I recall
&gt; that already made this work in the past. I don't know why it does not
&gt; work now.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Manuel Lemos

I don't know, honestly. I think Markus brought up an idea of an extension 
repository at some point in the past, and now that we have support for 
loadable extensions, we should restart that discussion.

&gt; I see things different.  
&gt; I just tried it. I could compile 4.0.1RC3, i could compile php-gtk-0.1.1
&gt; But when running a script i get the message:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  U	åìSè: Unable to initialize module
&gt; Module compiled with debug=220, thread-safety=43 module API=0
&gt; PHP compiled with debug=0, thread-safety=0 module API=20010901
&gt; These options need to match
&gt; in &lt;b&gt;/home/henning/button.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt; Can't load php_gtk module!

Read the warning !

The module is compiled with debug and thread safety while php is compiled without.

If you compile both the module and php with the same options it should work.

If you want binaries for Windows you can always download snapshots from \
kromann.info/php4.php. I have an automated cvs update and build process and I'm going \
to add more php modules as soon as I'm able to compile them.

Hy People,
I want to start working on the Website fpr the project.
As i am pretty new to the project i don't know
where are things needed to be done.

So i call You all to tell me your wishes and ideas
what you are missing on the website
and what should be done there.


- add a PHP GTK Applications page
- looking for more frequently asked questions on the list
  to add them to the FAQ
- putting further links to the ressources page
- installation hints for newbies
- a news page from which the newest is always on the homepage

Any more ideas?

thanx, henning

Hello,

I was willing to build php-gtk with PHP 4.0.6 under SuSE-Linux but every
version that I got has all sorts of problems. I wonder if anybody has an
idea of what is the matter. I tried the 0.1.1 and the latest CVS to see
if anything has been fixed. At the end of this message follows the build
steps captured with the script command. Version 0.1 also does not seem
to build with the same problems.

I also managed to build version 0.0.2 after hacking config_vars.mk to
add gtk-config --cflags that for some reason where not being added, but
when I tried to run test/gtk.php it exit with the error below. I recall
that already made this work in the past. I don't know why it does not
work now.

Regards,
Manuel Lemos

&gt; 
&gt;     You start by looking at ./ext_skel in php-gtk/ext. Its a
&gt;     helper shell script which creates an apropriate subdirectory
&gt;     with a skeleton based on the widget name you pass. This will
&gt;     work for small things and most likely not for bigger things
&gt;     but its a start.
&gt; 
&gt;     Make yourself familiar with generate/h2defs.py. This is
&gt;     basically where the automation starts. This takes your gtk
&gt;     widgets include files and produces *.defs file which are used
&gt;     by the PHP-GTK code generator to produce C-code.
&gt; 
&gt;     Again, for small things all you probably need to add is the
&gt;     proper definition of the constructor function of the class
&gt;     and there you go.
&gt; 
&gt;     However, if you methods of a widget have an unknown argument
&gt;     type like **char for example, you will have to write your own
&gt;     'override' function which goes into widget.overrides which is
&gt;     also parsed by the code generator.
&gt; 
&gt;     I probably left out some more important things but feel free
&gt;     to ask :)

Thank you. I don't have much free time right now. Maybe I will wait for
GNOME 2 Canvas support then.

What's possible in PHP-GTK equates to what's possible in GTK 1.2.x

- basically!

Only more easily and with more amenable database support.

&gt; Ok.

&gt; 
&gt; No urgence. Just wanted to see all that is possible with PHP-GTk.

Do you think It would be nice on the download page to say
CVS- recommended php version &lt;link&gt;4.1.0RC3&lt;/link&gt; or &lt;link&gt;CVS&lt;/link&gt;
0.1.1 - recommended php version &lt;link&gt;4.0.6&lt;/link&gt; ??? &lt;= does this work?
0.1.0 - recommended php version  &lt;link&gt;4.0.6&lt;/link&gt;

 From discussions on IRC, it appears that to make php-gtk to work the 
current RC3 only needs the 2 lines in main/php_gtk.c (and the define in 
php_gtk.h) changed to match CVS,
0.1.1a - which fixes those 2 changes? - or just tarball up current CVS?

Release announcements (once every few months never hurt anyone :) - even 
if it is only a few lines...

I know I take CVS for granted, but alot of people are still growing out 
of the download setup.exe syndrome, so a nice tarball 
(snapsgtk.php.net?) might be an idea...

thoughts....

&gt;I have just commited code that adds support for building shared
&gt;PHP-GTK extensions. The Win32 building process has not been adjusted
&gt;yet, this is only for Unix so far.
&gt;
&gt;The procedure is the same as for PHP extensions. You use
&gt;--enable-ext=shared or --with-ext=shared and when you do 'make install'
&gt;the .so file will be copied to the same directory that regular PHP
&gt;shared extensions live in.
&gt;
&gt;To load extensions, there is an .ini setting called
&gt;'php-gtk.extensions'. You simply list the extension filenames, separated
&gt;by commas and/or spaces, like this:
&gt;
&gt;php-gtk.extensions = php_gtk_sqpane.so, php_gtk_libglade.so
&gt;
&gt;This should be a good step towards making PHP-GTK more modular and also
&gt;having a repository of extensions.
&gt;

Hy,
as we just had such a question again,
wouldn't it be possible to have a version of php in our download area
of the webpage with which the current php-gtk release is approved
to compile?

I think lots of users just drop the thing when they go
mad finding a php version that works, I had those troubles, too,
and the only php version that i found was working was 4.0.7RC3, 
which is not available anymore, i got it from www.php.net/~zeev/,
but there is only a 4.1.0RC3 at this time.

Hello,

Is anybody making any efforts to add support to a Canvas widget? If not,
what does it take to do it?

What about drag and drop support? Is there anything in PHP-GTk with drag
and drop support?

&gt; Try CVS version of PHP and start over.

Ah, finally it built and run ok. Thanks.


I had all sorts of problems because I did not have the right combination
of PHP/GTK versions. It seems there is not a public version that builds
ok with anything else than the latest PHP/Zend/TSRM CVS versions

If I had this problem, I suppose many other people are having it. I
wonder why isn't PHP-GTK extension definitively integrated with a PHP
distribution like most of other PHP extensions? I don't know if this was
discussed before so I don't know if there is a reasoning behind this
curcumnstance.

Another question, why is drawing area example disabled in the demo
program?

Alan,

Are these calls necessary to initialize gtkhtml?

	gdk_rgb_init ();

    gtk_widget_set_default_colormap (gdk_rgb_get_cmap ());
    gtk_widget_set_default_visual (gdk_rgb_get_visual ());

I suspect that gdk_rgb_init() is but not sure about the other two. Have
you been able to find any docs on GtkHTML?

there are 3 functions that work.

Mmh looks like this broke the most of the old extensions.. :)

libglade, gtkhtml, scintilla, sqpane...


-- below is  a band aid patch.. -

The changes needed where consitent on all modules.

= defs files needed the constructor-of removed from functions. 
- Makefile.in needs the -c GtkSQPane- 
  * this appears to have limitations where there are constructors for
more that one object in one def file..

- the define line needs adding to all modules - was this accidental or
deliberate ?

#define PHP_GTK_SQPANE_GET(w) GTK_SQPANE(PHP_GTK__GET(w))

Well that patch is crap :) 

-- From what I can work out 

1. add the 
#define PHP_GTK_SQPANE_GET(w) GTK_SQPANE(PHP_GTK__GET(w))
to each of the php_xxx.h 

then make sure that the xxxxx.overrides has
#include "ext/xxxx/php_xxxx.h"

nearly there..

Because I actually had to fix some bugs in Zend engine in order to make

An example just hasn't been written yet. I suppose scribble.php could
become that example.

&gt;Ok.

Just a note: I wouldn't call PHP-GTK "experimental" code anymore. Not since 
I took that "alien experiment" thing off the front page anyway. :)

I am not sure what you mean. There are several nice Canvas widgets that
could be added to PHP-GTK for drawing vectorial graphics like this:

http://freshmeat.net/projects/gtkcanvas/

or even this:

http://diacanvas.sourceforge.net/

I don't know if anybody is interested to add support to them in PHP-GTK,
so I am asking what does it take to do to add support to them?

'What it takes to support them' is precisely what I was trying to explain, sorry, I \
was a tad over-brief there.

GtkCanvas requires imlib, which AFAIK we do not have support for.  This is anyway in \
the process of being phased out because GdkPixbuf is being put into place in GTK2.  \
When there is a stable release of GTK2 there will be a PHP-GTK2 which will \
incorporate GTK2.  This will have pixbuf support, and then we can start looking at \
GtkCanvas with a little more enthusiasm.

I shall say this once more and then go firmly to sleep ...

The GTK development team are phasing out the use of imlib.  GtkCanvas is being \
re-written to work with GdkPixbuf, which is integrated into GTK+2.  There is \
therefore absolutely no point in porting GtkCanvas into PHP-GTK at this moment in \
time, even if we could, which we can't because as Markus so clearly stated, we don't \
have imlib.

Schlaf gut!

ps Markus, I did my homework this time ;)

&gt; 
&gt; Well, methings everyone is interested :-)
&gt; 
&gt; What it takes? Knowledge of C and how to write PHP-GTK
&gt; extension; nothing more. It depends on the complexity of the
&gt; widget. Easy widgets don't even a line of code because most
&gt; of it can be autogenerated.
&gt; 
&gt; However, If widget starts to pass all kind of pervert C
&gt; structur pointers around with link list on their function
&gt; cals you will get some problems porting them.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, if you start working on a porting widgets to
&gt; PHP-GTK, thats the list to ask you concrete question.

&gt; &gt; I don't know if anybody is interested to add support to them in PHP-GTK,
&gt; &gt; so I am asking what does it take to do to add support to them?
&gt; 
&gt;     Well, methings everyone is interested :-)
&gt; 
&gt;     What it takes? Knowledge of C and how to write PHP-GTK
&gt;     extension; nothing more. It depends on the complexity of the
&gt;     widget. Easy widgets don't even a line of code because most
&gt;     of it can be autogenerated.
&gt; 
&gt;     However, If widget starts to pass all kind of pervert C
&gt;     structur pointers around with link list on their function
&gt;     cals you will get some problems porting them.
&gt; 
&gt;     Generally, if you start working on a porting widgets to
&gt;     PHP-GTK, thats the list to ask you concrete question.

Right, actually this interests me more than the other because it already
has UML diagramming elements. So, unless anybody more experience would
like to have a go at this one, where I would start? I even haven't
started looking at PHP-GTK because I have no idea what to look for.

    Yes, but this one for example needs imlib to support images

    You start by looking at ./ext_skel in php-gtk/ext. Its a
    helper shell script which creates an apropriate subdirectory
    with a skeleton based on the widget name you pass. This will
    work for small things and most likely not for bigger things
    but its a start.

    Make yourself familiar with generate/h2defs.py. This is
    basically where the automation starts. This takes your gtk
    widgets include files and produces *.defs file which are used
    by the PHP-GTK code generator to produce C-code.

    Again, for small things all you probably need to add is the
    proper definition of the constructor function of the class
    and there you go.

    However, if you methods of a widget have an unknown argument
    type like **char for example, you will have to write your own
    'override' function which goes into widget.overrides which is
    also parsed by the code generator.


    I probably left out some more important things but feel free
    to ask :)

I see things different.  
I just tried it. I could compile 4.0.1RC3, i could compile php-gtk-0.1.1
But when running a script i get the message:

&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  U	åìSè: Unable to initialize module
Module compiled with debug=220, thread-safety=43 module API=0
PHP compiled with debug=0, thread-safety=0 module API=20010901
These options need to match
 in &lt;b&gt;/home/henning/button.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Can't load php_gtk module!

Trying to use php-gtk cvs with php-4.0.7RC3
I can build, too but I get the error:

&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  Unable to load dynamic library
'/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20010901/php_gtk.so' -
/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20010901/php_gtk.so: undefined
symbol: alloc_globals_id in &lt;b&gt;/home/henning/button.php&lt;/b&gt; on line
&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Can't load php_gtk module!

So, still, the only versions that I found to be possible to compile
AND work togehter until now are 4.0.7RC3 of php and 0.1.1 of php-gtk.

And exactly this version of PHP is nowhere available anymore,
at least i don't now where.

In other words it means no user will be able to compile, test,
play around with php-gtk at this time as long as he hasn't 
knowledge in c programming, the inner structure of PHP
and whatever to solve all these problems, And if they have the knowledge
i wonder if they have the time to. 

So why don't make it easy for them and give them a php version
that works really?

I still think Henning and Alan have a point.

The single most frequently recurring question on the list is about compile issues, \
mainly (admittedly) from people trying to compile against 4.0.6

If we had a snapshot available on gtk.php.net that we know works with PHP-GTK cvs \
version, we'd get less of those questions and probably more happy users.

That is simply a mismatch between the installed header and library files
and the version of PHP you are trying to run.

&gt; Do you think It would be nice on the download page to say
&gt; CVS- recommended php version &lt;link&gt;4.1.0RC3&lt;/link&gt; or &lt;link&gt;CVS&lt;/link&gt;
&gt; 0.1.1 - recommended php version &lt;link&gt;4.0.6&lt;/link&gt; ??? &lt;= does this work?
&gt; 0.1.0 - recommended php version  &lt;link&gt;4.0.6&lt;/link&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;  From discussions on IRC, it appears that to make php-gtk to work the 
&gt; current RC3 only needs the 2 lines in main/php_gtk.c (and the define in 
&gt; php_gtk.h) changed to match CVS,
&gt; 0.1.1a - which fixes those 2 changes? - or just tarball up current CVS?
&gt; 
&gt; Release announcements (once every few months never hurt anyone :) - even 
&gt; if it is only a few lines...
&gt; 
&gt; I know I take CVS for granted, but alot of people are still growing out 
&gt; of the download setup.exe syndrome, so a nice tarball 
&gt; (snapsgtk.php.net?) might be an idea...
&gt;

There are several reasons for not putting PHP-GTK into PHP ext/ directory.

1. It is just too extensive. Not only does it have its own loadable 
extensions, but also its own documentation and web modules.

2. It is licensed under LGPL.

3. It is on a completely different release cycle from PHP. Actually, most 
of the extensions in ext/ directory will be moved out to PECL/PEAR soon.

I don't see why SuSE and other distributors cannot distribute PHP-GTK just 
like any other package. I hope that the building issues will be resolved 
now that 4.1.0 release is imminent and there will be something stable to 
build against.

And it doesn't make sense to me to keep something like that in ext/ 
directory. Those who need PHP-GTK can get it easily, those who don't won't 
be burdened by a huge extension in their source tree.

&gt; &gt; 3. It is on a completely different release cycle from PHP. Actually, most

&gt;

Because that's how it started out. PEAR now has its own /pear module and 
almost all classes will be moved to it, with the exception of core ones, 
like PEAR and PEAR_Installer.

&gt;Ask them. The fact is they only distribute modules that are part of PHP.

That's because there hasn't been an extension like PHP-GTK yet.

Alan, you are too impatient. :) I was working on GdkPixbuf support
yesterday, but it required changing generator in several places since
GdkPixbuf is not in GtkObject hierarchy. I'm almost done.

I am looking at adding stream support in for the gtkhtml module - this should enable \
realization of an actuall browser (as the callbacks for images etc. ask for streams - \
i think)..

anyway, my ZEND API experience is  a bit limited (usually to fixing segfaults in \
midgard) so This the stuff below is mostly guesswork from the api docs at zend.com

The two functions below illustrate the issue - 
gtk_html_begin returns a struct, GtkHTMLStream
gtk_html_write uses this as one of it's inputs to determine where to send the data..

I have attempted to wrap the return value into a PHP Resource and defined a simple \
struct to wrap the real one..

however I dont seem to be able to get the address back out of the struct.. (or am \
even sure that I am setting it correctly)... 

suggestions, other good (simple) examples of code doing something similar would be \
helpfull..

gtk_html_begin,write and end now all work thanks to the note below....

I am now looking at the callback signals for gtkhtml..


gtkhtml is supposed to work something like this..

create the gtkhtml object.
connect url_requested to a function 'x'
call gtk_html_begin, get the stream
put the html into with gtk_html_write.
call gtk_html_end.

meanwhile.. if there is an image tag, a 'url_requested' call back is supposted to be \
emited.

this signal is emitted with
the object(Gtkhtml), the URL, a new HTMLStream
as the parameters

by adding a g_message  prior to the call in htmlimage.c (from gtkhtml) I know that it \
is calling 	gtk_signal_emit_by_name with url_requested -  but I'm not quite sure \
where php is picking up the callback.. 

as it does not appear to be doing anything - even emit warnings saying I dont know \
how to handle this..

clues would be good... :)

thx 

alan


since I know php-gtk wont know how to deal with the HTMLStream comming in,

Hi All,

I have just finished libglade on Win32. Who has a file i can test this with ?

As soon as I have testet it I'll upload new binaries to the web site.

Okay, 

I downloaded Frank's lastest release for Win32 and tried out the included 
gtk.php. Everything was fine except the Drag and Drop feature. I can drag, 
but I cannot drop. The cursor has the plus sign as soon as I start the drag, 
and I don't get the great Perl quote, no matter if I drop on the To button or 
not.

It seems to be a problem only on Win32 (I have 98); it works on Linux.
Can anyone verify this, please?

Thanks,
Eric

Hi All,

I have just released a new set of binaries for PHP-GTK. The build is made with the \
latest version of PHP and PHP-GTK including support for libGlade (finally).

The binaries are available from gtk.php.net.

I have also downloaded a versionof Glade for Win32, but I have not tested it yet :-)

If you have any problems or comments, please feel free to contact me.

Happy Hacking

Hey there php-gtk fans!

I installed the new windows version including the libglade support
today, and all worked great, apart from one little problem:

   (...)
   $gx = &amp;new GladeXML('project1.glade');
   $label2 = $gx-&gt;get_widget("label2");
   (...)

In my project1.glade file there a widget called label2 which
I try to access using get_widget(), but php says "Call to undefined
function".
I think get_widget is supported in the linux version; is it going to
be supported on win32 as well? Or is there another workaround to
get the widgets from glade?

Thanks a lot for your help!
Carsten

With some help from Andrei the download page on gtk.php.net will now give you the \

I extracted your php-gtk-0.1.1a-win32.zip to c:\php4gtk and that is where

winnt used to be the default folder for php.ini but I think you can put it in the same folder as your scripts, the same forlder as the binaries, winnt or specify a location with -c option. Some errors has been fixed with this so it might have changed from php 4.0.1 to the current version.

Do you think it would be a good idea to also link to Glade for
win32 for our windows users now so they find all information they
need?

I only found http://members.aol.com/suboner/code/Gtk/glade.html
but I don't know if thats the 'official' one or not.

Ok, well, lets start discussing it.

I think everyone agrees with Andrei not to bloat php-gtk and move
external widgets out of the core.

Andrei, yet you haven't told us which mechanism will be
available: loadable with a shared module, e.g.
gl_gtk('php-gtk_glarea.so'); or built-in or both?

So we want a new cvs module then? php-gtk-ext ? Or does it still
lives somewhere inside php-gtk? (probably not I guess)

The buildprocess shall meet the following requirements:

.) work under win32 &amp; linux(unix)

For linux, its obviously to use configure and friends. For
windows maybe we can make a similar facility which doesn't have
too much dependencies. I don't know if it can be done with batch
files only'; probably not. So we have to depend on something
bigger which is cygwin then? Then I think we can use configure or
a similar process too.

.) externals must be intelligently capable of having different
capabilities depending on the platform. For example, the only
win32 binary for gtkglarea doesn't support all function which are
available from the windows build. So it should be easy to write
one source which handles both (problem with differnt defs and
override files right now)

.) depending on the first question, define which you want
external and which built-in

.) extension AND widget source (if license permits it) can be put
in there


Example layout:

php-gtk-ext/
    glarea/
    gdkgl/
    sqpane/
    scintilla/


A widget dependency system seems also necessary. For example,
glarea depends on gdkgl.


If possible, windows binary distribution should always ship with
all working widget if possible. Or at least, two sets of
binaries. One with the php-gtk core and one with all widgets (if
the dl() mechanism works out)

Lets roll the dices.

GtkButtonBox.

set_spacing() and get_spacing() are both marked as deprecated in GTK2, the plan being \
to get rid of the inherited 'spacing' property completely and refer only to the child \
and layout functions.

May therefore be a good idea if someone could please bring get_child_ipadding() and \

Do you think it would be a good idea to also link to Glade for
win32 for our windows users now so they find all information they
need?

I only found http://members.aol.com/suboner/code/Gtk/glade.html
but I don't know if thats the 'official' one or not.

I don't understand ..


After I announced the availability on some german lists of
PHP-GTK with Libglade under windows the first mails came asking
where Glade is.

For Linux user its not a problem; most of the time it comes with
your distribution anyway.

I have created a Windows installer using Inno Setup

The source is at the bottom of this message.
I extracted your php-gtk-0.1.1a-win32.zip to c:\php4gtk and that is where
the installer expects to find the files.

If this is of any interest to you please feel free to use it and treat it as your

I have put an install .exe generated by the install script at

This particular php.ini overrides everything - it doesn't act as normal, dunno why.  Deleting it from the windows directory and adding aforementioned peace-loving version to the PHP-GTK dir means suddenly I don't get those messages about php_gtk.dll not being found any more.

Magic, ennit?
:)

Looks really good, apart from that.

This is a win98 (pretty clean) with the latest binaries, running under 
vmware.

I'm getting the output below from get_widget

 C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\phpmole\phpmole&gt;C:\php4\php phpmole.php
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.0.8-dev
Content-type: text/html

O:8"GladeXML":1{i:0;i;2;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fatal error&lt;/b&gt;:  Call to undefined function:  get_widget() in 
&lt;b&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\phpmole\phpmole\phpmole.php&lt;/b&gt; on line 
&lt;b&gt;106&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;



102&gt;     $gx = &amp;new 
GladeXML("c:\\WINDOWS\\Desktop\\phpmole\\phpmole\\glade\\gtkmidgard.glade");
103&gt;     echo serialize($gx);
104&gt;     // $gx = &amp;new GladeXML(APPDIR ."glade/gtkmidgard.glade");
105&gt;      // get the text element and replace it with
106&gt;      $window = $gx-&gt;get_widget("winmain");

Hi Allan,

As far as I can telle the zip file contains files for PHP4 also, and that is the php \
binaries.

Is it just me or does the php version from your build not honor
any php.ini in the current path or even when given on the command
line with '-c' ?

Well, I solved the 'non-occuring signals', the php file in the tar ball sets the \
signals after the $gtkhtml-&gt;begin/write calls 

doh - as homer simpson would have said..


I now have the callback url_requested working - eg. It calls back!.. however. \
url_requested sends a signal of POINTER_POINTER, and currently the gtk code does not \
handle pointer callbacks..

so the question now goes should all callbacks of pointers be defined as references.. \
- at least giving the recievers of these pointers a chance to use them.....

&gt; &gt; from  /php-gtk/main/php_gtk_object.c line 517..

		case GTK_TYPE_POINTER:
			php_error(E_NOTICE, "%s(): internal error: GTK_TYPE_POINTER unsupported",
					  get_active_function_name(TSRMLS_C));

			ZEND_REGISTER_RESOURCE(value, arg, le_gtkhtmlstream);
			
			/*
			MAKE_STD_ZVAL(value);
			ZVAL_NULL(value);
			*/
			break;


Initially the idea is just to use the gtkhtmlstream that I have already created.. - \
this may be better renamed to le_gtkpointer_wrapper ????

however, I dont think the ZEND_REGISTER_RESOURCE is not creating the correct type \
value in 'value' as I get N: rather than i:0; - (the serialized return from \
gtk_html_beginw)

anyway anybody got Ideas to keep the ball rolling......

I must say I have the same problem, but I should be able to fix it :-)

I guess I was too fast last night releasing new binaries. I just tested compilation \
and parsing of a glade file and that looked ok.

As soon as I have figured out how to handle GtkWidget( types in the generator I'll \
update the release.

Hi All,

I have fixed this in CVS now. I'm going to upload a new set of binaries in a moment, \
and I'll update the download page to show 12-Oct-2001, but keep the same name on the \
zip file.

- Frank

&gt; Confirmed; same here.

&gt; I've had problems loading pixmaps from files over the last couple of binary \

I also saw that on the previous zip binaries.

&gt;Okay,

&gt;I downloaded Frank's lastest release for Win32 and tried out the included

&gt;and I don't get the great Perl quote, no matter if I drop on the To button or

&gt;
&gt;It seems to be a problem only on Win32 (I have 98); it works on Linux.
&gt;Can anyone verify this, please?

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] Re: GtkHTML next set of questions...


gtk_html_begin,write and end now all work thanks to the note below....

I am now looking at the callback signals for gtkhtml..


gtkhtml is supposed to work something like this..

create the gtkhtml object.
connect url_requested to a function 'x'
call gtk_html_begin, get the stream
put the html into with gtk_html_write.
call gtk_html_end.

meanwhile.. if there is an image tag, a 'url_requested' call back is supposted to be \
emited.

this signal is emitted with
the object(Gtkhtml), the URL, a new HTMLStream
as the parameters

by adding a g_message  prior to the call in htmlimage.c (from gtkhtml) I know that it \
is calling gtk_signal_emit_by_name with url_requested -  but I'm not quite sure where \
php is picking up the callback.. 

as it does not appear to be doing anything - even emit warnings saying I dont know \
how to handle this..

clues would be good... :)

thx 

alan


since I know php-gtk wont know how to deal with the HTMLStream comming in,

the tar ball is at
gtkhtml.1.2.tgz &lt;http://midgard.hklc.com/gtkhtml.1.2.tgz&gt;

there is a php file gtkhtml.php

which attempts to conntect the url_requested signal to a dummy function 
- but it never gets called..


there is also an updated phmole at midgard.hklc.com, I added various 
things like
- tool tips for php functions - showing the function stucture
- autocompletion
- support for midgard servers.

I wonder if andrei or markus could recommend a good communication

I have started attacking this using an object rather than a resource now 
- so there is a bit more example code on how to do it..

&gt; I don't have unix for about another 2 weeks, can't build anything on Windows and am \
&gt; new to it all anyway.  Having said all that ... "typedef" only comes up in \
&gt; php_gtk+_types relating to enumerated flags, "struct" (if you look where Andrei put \
&gt; gtkallocation and gtkrequisition) only turns up in gtk.defs; I'd assume that Andrei \
&gt; has a great deal of familiarity with the Zend API one way or another, so wouldn't \
&gt; it make sense to follow a similar pattern there? - see generator/generator.php to \
&gt; view the schema - 
&gt; I may be talking out of my backside as usual, of course....

&gt; Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] using resources... for GtkHTMLStream
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking at adding stream support in for the gtkhtml module - this should \
&gt; enable realization of an actuall browser (as the callbacks for images etc. ask for \
&gt; streams - i think).. 
&gt; anyway, my ZEND API experience is  a bit limited (usually to fixing segfaults in \
&gt; midgard) so This the stuff below is mostly guesswork from the api docs at zend.com 
&gt; The two functions below illustrate the issue - 
&gt; gtk_html_begin returns a struct, GtkHTMLStream
&gt; gtk_html_write uses this as one of it's inputs to determine where to send the \
&gt; data.. 
&gt; I have attempted to wrap the return value into a PHP Resource and defined a simple \
&gt; struct to wrap the real one.. 
&gt; however I dont seem to be able to get the address back out of the struct.. (or am \
&gt; even sure that I am setting it correctly)...  
&gt; suggestions, other good (simple) examples of code doing something similar would be \
&gt; helpfull..

Sorry I completely ignored this one in the first place as I was
to busy. I'm not a Zend guru myself.

parse_args returns a zval* to your resource; not the resource
directly:

Try the following:

zval *resource;
int resource_type;

if (!php_gtk_parse_args(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "rsi", &amp;resource, &amp;buffer, &amp;size))
	return;

gs = zend_list_find(Z_RESVAL_P(resource), &amp;resource_type);
if (!gs || resource_type != le_gtkhtmlstream) {
	php_error(...
	return;
}

Yeah, I know, I know.. I think I have XFree 4.0.3 running on my laptop,
is that going to be enough to install latest Mesa?

&gt; I am now looking at the callback signals for gtkhtml..
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; gtkhtml is supposed to work something like this..
&gt; 
&gt; create the gtkhtml object.
&gt; connect url_requested to a function 'x'
&gt; call gtk_html_begin, get the stream
&gt; put the html into with gtk_html_write.
&gt; call gtk_html_end.
&gt; 
&gt; meanwhile.. if there is an image tag, a 'url_requested' call back is supposted to \
&gt; be emited. 
&gt; this signal is emitted with
&gt; the object(Gtkhtml), the URL, a new HTMLStream
&gt; as the parameters
&gt; 
&gt; by adding a g_message  prior to the call in htmlimage.c (from gtkhtml) I know that \
&gt; it is calling gtk_signal_emit_by_name with url_requested -  but I'm not quite sure \
&gt; where php is picking up the callback..  
&gt; as it does not appear to be doing anything - even emit warnings saying I dont know \
&gt; how to handle this.. 
&gt; clues would be good... :)
&gt; 
&gt; thx 
&gt; 
&gt; alan
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; since I know php-gtk wont know how to deal with the HTMLStream comming in, 
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; parse_args returns a zval* to your resource; not the resource

you can have a go with

phpmole.0.7.zip &lt;http://midgard.hklc.com/phpmole.0.7.zip&gt;

It may be a bit of an overkill for first tests..

I switch the scintilla widget for the gtktext one (if scintilla does not 
exist), It fires up here..

I'm not sure what the effect of the paths may be, you may have to modify 
the phpmole file to point to the correct directory on windows.

Hi Carsten,

I just updated the binary download an hour ago. Please download again.

- Frank

&gt; 
&gt; Hey there php-gtk fans!
&gt; 
&gt; I installed the new windows version including the libglade support
&gt; today, and all worked great, apart from one little problem:
&gt; 
&gt;    (...)
&gt;    $gx = &amp;new GladeXML('project1.glade');
&gt;    $label2 = $gx-&gt;get_widget("label2");
&gt;    (...)
&gt; 
&gt; In my project1.glade file there a widget called label2 which
&gt; I try to access using get_widget(), but php says "Call to undefined
&gt; function".
&gt; I think get_widget is supported in the linux version; is it going to
&gt; be supported on win32 as well? Or is there another workaround to
&gt; get the widgets from glade?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot for your help!
&gt; Carsten

Hi All,

With some help from Andrei the download page on gtk.php.net will now give you the \
latest file with fixes to libGlase so get_widget() and other functions actually work.

P.S. Next project will be "Scintilla"

Frank, you're a star :)

You're right, it's loading from the wrong directory, I moved php.exe and everything \
else out of php4 dir and into php4\dev (where php files and xpm files reside) and \
typed:

cd\php4\dev
php -q gtk.php

and hey presto, it all works fine!  Thank you for analyzing that, I had thought along \
those lines as far as putting xpm files into strange directories and trying again ... \
but not in that direction..

I've removed the exe and dll's from php4\dev back to php4 and everything works as \
expected *so long as* I stick the xpm files in php4 alongside them.

But it didn't *used* to load from the wrong directory... I've used the \
"fileopener.php" file we all write first, from the first week of using PHP-GTK, and \
I've always put the xpm files in the same directory as the php files until now.

There the mystery remains.  Something must've been changed in the way PHP chooses \
which directory is "current" for this to happen, but I'm utterly ignorant of it.

Hi Step,

The only thing I can see then is you are running your stuff with an other current \
directory.

if you do this:

cd\
php4\php -q c:\php4\samples\test.php

and your test.php loads a pixmap without a full path it will load it from c:\ where \
it does not exist.

cd \php4\samples
\php4\php -q test.php

will give you the correct working directory and your pixmap will load as expected.

If this is not what is happening on your system I dont know what is going wrong. I do \
remember some errors in the way php handled the current working directory though so \
if this worked in 0.0.4 that might be due to an error in php it self ?

- Frank

&gt; ps Markus and I already tried this, my pixmaps load fine elsewhere..

&gt; &gt; )  yeah sorry I didn't realise til a moment ago, I sent you error messages for \
&gt; &gt; gtk.php out of the samples folder (which I'd just been running) as well as for \
&gt; &gt; your file ... yours is just the last three lines!
&gt; 
&gt; There's nothing wrong with the pixmaps.  Glade can use them.  There's nothing wrong \
&gt; with my code, and there's certainly nothing wrong with Andrei's code.  I have the \
&gt; pixmaps in the same directory 'dev' as the php files, and this hasn't changed since \
&gt; Day One.  The only thing that's changed is that they used to work....! 
&gt; There's something very wrong with my set-up somewhere along the line, and I can't \
&gt; even see how, I just know everything started to go wrong after 0.0.4 - but as \
&gt; Markus has gently pointed out, it may be nothing to do with PHP-GTK at all. 
&gt; Don't worry about it, it's just this machine.

the first time it's worked in months, &amp; okay so I've been up half the night writing a \
new one to override the default settings in certain areas, but hey!

The one I use for PHP-GTK only has 2 lines in it, and I leave it in the php4 \
directory alongside php.exe and friends - the two lines being the include path and \
the error reporting.

but this is on win98, and I've no idea how other breeds of Windows feel about it.

winnt used to be the default folder for php.ini but I think you can put it in the \

location with -c option. Some errors has been fixed with this so it might have \

When we convert extension (and even GTK itself), is the goal to
get the 100% the same or can we modify methods for convinience?

For exmaple, I was thinking about the GtkEditable insert()
method. Currently it takes two parameters, string and position.
Everywhere else where the insert word is used in context it used
to insert data from beginning and separate methods exist to
append data to the end.

Therefore, changing insert() with only parameter to set position
to 0 and introduce GtkEditable::append() . There's no BC problem
(because the second parameter to insert() wasn't optional).

Comments?

For Linux user its not a problem; most of the time it comes with

As we discussed yesterday, probably something like dl_gtk().

&gt; A widget dependency system seems also necessary. For example,
&gt; glarea depends on gdkgl.

I don't think we have any need for an elaborate dependency system.
Checking for something that's required in config.m4 is enough.

Just so everyone's aware - 

In this instance, I had misread the header file at the first pass, and both the \
methods I was asking to be implemented are actually deprecated in GTK+2.0  (oops).

The conclusion of the subsequent discussion between Andrei &amp; self was that most of \
the major changes in GTK2.0 are internal rather than external, and won't be evident \
to PHP-GTK users.  It seems sensible that the manual should highlight \
deprecated/broken functions and classes, giving alternatives where they exist, &amp; \
ensuring that the given alternatives are implemented in both current PHP-GTK and in \
GTK2.0.  There are a few places where the entire philosophy behind a class has been \
altered radically, and in those cases we should make a point of saying that this is \
so &amp; that coding using these classes will need to be rewritten at some point, &amp; \
provide a link to the relevant GTK2.0 manual page for now alongside instructions for \
using the current implementation. 

Functions/methods exposed in PHP-GTK source but not yet implemented should be covered \
and marked as *not implemented*  where they are likely to be implemented in the \
future, ie are not marked as deprecated in GTK+1.3.9.  Anyone doing this in the \
manual should mention it to the dev list.

Hope that sounds like a fair assessment, Andrei ...

to get rid of the inherited 'spacing' property completely and refer only to the child \

Is gs really a newly allocated resource so you have to register
it? Or is it arleady an existing one? If it does already exist
(what I assume) you should fetch it from the resource lirst (quick
look , could be wrong).

Btw, it would help telling what exactly does not work.

And, with the extra arguments, ... you really want to 'merge'
this? I think it should be added to the args, no?

Probably worth continuing on php-gtk-dev only...

I was getting a bit further with
        MAKE_STD_ZVAL(myresource);
	ZVAL_RESOURCE(myresource, gs) ;
        /*ZEND_REGISTER_RESOURCE(myresource, gs, le_gtkhtmlstream); */
  now the function does not segfault, but does not appear to pass resource around..

then function below is called when the browser is loading a webpage, and wants an \
image,  it emits a signal 'url_requested', which I have added a method of html \
connect_url_request.

this builds the callback data array in data, and calls this function.. - with a new \
stream.

- theoretically, when you load the web page, you would get  a number of these call \
for each of the images. the callback routine would then either get from the cache or \
open a non-blocking socket to get the file/image..

in theory a number of these streams could be open at one time (assuming the program \
can be taught to multi task well...)


on the php side..
it is supposed to work like this...

$string = implode('',file("http://www.php.net"));
$gtkhtml = &amp;new gtkhtml();
$gtkhtml-&gt;connect_url_request("my_url_callback");
$gtkhtml-&gt;load_from_string($string);


function my_url_callback($url,$stream) {
  global $gtkhtml;
  $string = implode('',file("http://www.php.net".$url));
  $gtkhtml-&gt;write($stream,$string);
}

the code below just segfaults when url_requested is emitted.

with the modification above, $stream does not appear to be a resource... (although Im \
still testing..)

thx

alan

You can do this still too. signal_autoconnect accept an hash of
functions to substitute with your own function/method and
parameters.

Here is a copy from my code, should get you started:

@$gx-&gt;signal_autoconnect( array(
    // main window
'on_menu_file_quit_activate'            =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this, 'shutdown')),
'on_mainWindow_destroy'                 =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this, 'shutdown')),
'on_textSqlIn_key_press_event'          =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this, 'doQuery')),
[...]

The value of the hash is an array with the function to call
following the parameters (not used in this example), it would
look like:

'function_defined_in_glade' =&gt; array('call_this_function_instead', $with, $arguments),

I've thought about this and while it would be possible to implement, I
don't see how wrapping pointers in resources is going to be useful in
PHP-GTK land. I mean, what will you be able to do with this resource
except pass it onto another function, perhaps?

The general philosophy is to try and keep PHP-GTK pretty close to the Gtk+ 
itself and other language bindings. We simplified methods where we could, 
but I don't think we should start adding new methods just because it seems 
appropriate. For one thing, in Gtk2, all .defs files will be autogenerated 
and the more things we change by hand, the more we'll have to keep in sync 
in the future.

Try the the $event-&gt;type property when your handler for
'select_row' is called. It should be something like
GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS .

Btw, googling such questions often results in quicker answers.

came across this bug with scintilla - I have sent the bugfix to micampe@f2s.com as well,  

the $scintilla-&gt;marker_add returns an integer (called a handle by the docs)
(which is essential if a class tree is to work!)
this is the snippet from scintilla.defs

(method marker_add
  (of-object Scintilla (Gtk))
  (c-name gtk_scintilla_marker_add)
  (return-type int)                 &lt;---- change to int
  (parameter (type-and-name int line))
  (parameter (type-and-name int marker_number))
)


change to gtkscintilla.c

int gtk_scintilla_marker_add(GtkScintilla *sci, int line, int marker_number)
{
    return scintilla_send_message(SCINTILLA(sci-&gt;scintilla),
        2043, (int) line, (int) marker_number);
}

regards

Alan

This is somewhat problematic -- what if people try to compile against an
older version of Scintilla that doesn't have this fix yet?

I've just uploaded the latest copy of gtkhtml to 
http://midgard.hklc.com/phpgtkhtml.1.0.tgz

Below is the readme from the file, the only thing left on the todo list is to make \
sure that object based callbacks work. other than that it is pretty much completed.. \
- the tes t program event works without curl.. (as I used non blocking fsockopen).. \
with a bit more work (eg. connect the link presses to callbacks) it could be made to \
browse things...

---------README----------------------

Prerequisites (or stuff you are going to need).
/---------------------------------------------------
A UNIX system! (sorry unless windows binaries are available - this will be so for a \
little while!)

On a packaged system Redhat/Mandrake/Debian
libgtkhtml, libgtkhtml-dev
--  these have quite a few dependancies *
like.. 
libgal, libgnomeprint,libdb3, libgdk_pixbuf
libart_lgpl,libgdk_imlib,libgnome

It may also depend on libgconf (optional)


On non package systems (or build it yourself)
libgtkhtml is available from 
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gtkhtml


Downloading
/-----------------------------
current location of php gtkhtml bindings ..
http://midgard.hklc.com/phpgtkhtml.*.tgz (see version number)




Building
/-------------------------------------------------------

Move this directory (ext/html) into the ext directory of php-gtk
run
/configure --enable-html --enable-scintilla ... (and all the other extensions you \
want) make
make install


General info:
/----------------------------------------------------
most of the conversion is pretty straight forwared - the c function maps closly to \
the  php one.. - have a look at html.defs for a rough idea. (below all the enums)


/-- Oddities
Save
takes 1 argument - the call back function that recieves the data.
This function then recieves the data in a string.

Export
takes 2 argument - the type and the call back function that recieves the data.
This function then recieves the data in a string.

connect_url_request("function")
because the callback for url_request returns a pointer to a pointer, the base
gtk library would never be able to understand this - so I had to add a special \
callback wrapper for this callback


set_editor_api
- this one is strange..., the editor api struct is a series of callbacks for \
different editor events the php version of this function is rather long winded, but \
works..

$gtkhtml-&gt;set_editor_api(
	callback check_word,
	callback suggestion_request,
	callback add_to_session,
	callback add_to_personal,
	callback command,
	callback event,
	callback create_input_line)

each of these functions will call back in different ways...
function checkword("word") return TRUE/FALSE
function suggestion_request("word")
function add_to_session("word")	// no idea what this does.
function add_to_personal("word") // no idea what this does.
function command(commandtype (look at the enums for command in html.defs)) return \
TRUE/FALSE function event(eventtype, STRING|0)
  3 types of event: command,image_url,delete
  delete returns 0 as the second entity, the other 2 return strings.
  event type is another enum!
function input_line(0) // this is messy cause I'm not sure how to return the empty \
function


$gtkhtml-&gt;set_color($string|$r,$b,$g)
$gtkhtml-&gt;set_default_background_color($string|$r,$b,$g)
set colours using "#rrggbb" or r,g,b


The overrides file has to define these due to the HTMLStream Resource not being \
handle in the Gtk Wrapper lib. $gtkhtml-&gt;begin,begin_content,write,end





TODO:
/-----------------------------------------------------------------

or whats remaining:

URGENT:
All callback functions should take arrays as the function and use this to do object \
callbacks


Enumerated (enums) are defined in defs:
these are interpreted by the gtk library - and from my guess will never work as \
strings. however they should work as constants - so that will have to do!
There is also a nasty hack of creating the GTK_TYPE_GTKHTML enums...


gtk_htmleditorapi_create_input_line
does not currently allow you to return a widget!

GtkHTMLStream Resource does not free the Gtkstream Struct If it is left open.


gtk_html_set_iframe_parent - not converted
print_with_header_footer - not converted
print - not converted

print needs 'Gnome Print' to work - which may be a little while...
gtk_html_set_iframe_parent = maybe later.. when I work out what it is used for.

MAKE $20,000 in $5 Bills in weeks Using Paypal 

 The e-mail Letter using PAypal not slow postage
I want to offer this program to everyone I have had 
contact with or have sponsored into a program.  You may or
may not be interested.  Just thought I'd pass it along as 
a quick way to make some extra cash and it has been proven
to be completely LEGAL. You are providing a service and
hundreds of people will be sending you $5 each.


                   PLEASE READ THIS
*******************************************************
This is something that I wouldn't normally even look at, 
except I read An ARTICLE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on 
6/16/2001 about PayPal and x.com.

The e-mails just keep coming in for this program so that 
meant somebody's making money with it. I finally decided 
to read it and I am very glad I did. Please take a moment 
to read on! 

There have been other articles written about these 
companies in other well recognized journals.  Because I'm 
a member of PayPal, I use it everyday in my business so I 
knew that this was real and would work. 

THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!! 

Complete it in one hour and you will never forget the day 
you first received it!!! 

Everything is done on the Internet by E-Mail. NEED PROOF? 
Here is a testimonial from individual who decided to 
invest nothing more than a little of their time. 

Testimonial from: 
********************************************** 

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC 
Hey ! This is Mary.  I sent 20 e-mails out like you said 
and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was up 
to over $12,000! I owe you! 

*********************************************

GETTING STARTED
If you don't already have a PayPal account, the first thing 
you need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two 
minutes and PayPal will deposit $5.00 for opening your 
account. It may take some time before Paypal deposits the 
$5 but they will, once your account is established.  That 
makes this program FREE! Don't delay. Send $5 as soon as 
you open your account and get it back later.

         Here's the link to join Paypal
 https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=andyo%40prodigy.net

BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER ACCOUNT! OR 
YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO $100 DOLLARS ONLY!!!  YOU WILL 
MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!! 

Then...... E-Mail $5.00 from your PayPal account to the 
FIRST name on the list (#1) along with a little note like:     

"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST." 

BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED.... YOU WON'T BE 
DISAPPOINTED!!! 

Read the following and you will agree this is a very 
exciting opportunity. 

ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY RIGHT NOW? HOW DOES 
$20,000 IN TWO WEEKS SOUND? 

Don't laugh! Try this for a change while you wait for 
the others to start working. One hour of work to get 
started and no mailing lists! 

This service is 100% legal.
 
(refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 
1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, 
also in the code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received). 

Here's How It Works

Unlike many other programs, this THREE LEVEL PROGRAM 
is more REALISTIC and so much FASTER. Because it is so 
easy, the response rate for this program is VERY HIGH,
VERY FAST -- Internet E-Mail FAST -- and you will see 
results in two weeks or less compared to a similar mail
order program that takes weeks and months.

JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT MONTHS BILLS! 

You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other 
programs). You should also send them to people who 
send their programs, because they know these programs 
work and they are already believers in the system!  
This program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER 
RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already in a program, 
stay with it, but do yourself a favour and DO THIS ONE 
as well. 

START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and takes NO INVESTMENT! 
It will pay off long before other programs even begin 
to trickle in! 

Just give ONE person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, 
this $5.00 is $5.00 YOU WILL GET FREE FROM Paypal) 
That's all! If you already have a PayPal account and do 
not receive their $5.00 gift, feel free out of the 
goodness of your HEART to donate a $5.00 GIFT to the 
person in the number 1 spot to have your name added to 
their advertisement list. So anyone's  MAXIMUM INVESTMENT 
IS only $5.00. The LORD will Bless you for it!

Follow the simple instructions and in a few weeks you 
will have $20,000 in your bank account! Because of the 
ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! FROM just 
ONE $5.00 bill.

WHY PAYPAL?
They will send your payment to anyone with an e-mail
address anywhere in the world.  They will notify the person 
by e-mail that you have sent $5 to that e-mail and the 
owner will arrange to collect the money from Paypal. 
Paypal will deduct a small fee.

YAHOO PAY DIRECT can also send payment to anyone 
with an e-mail address, so if you have any problems
trying to send money through Paypal, try Yahoo Pay 
Direct.  Go to http://www.yahoo.com and click on Yahoo
Pay Direct.  It's FREE. 

Follow These Simple Instructions: 

1.  E-Mail the $5.00 from your PayPal account to the 
FIRST name on the list (#1) along with a note saying 
"Add me to your mailing list". Only the first person 
on the list gets your name and five dollar gift. Edit 
only the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE 
LIST.  Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME 
to the list in the THIRD (#3) position. 

Don't try to add your name in the first place in order 
to earn money fast! If you do that, you will ONLY reach 
people you sent e-mail to and then your name will be 
immediately removed from the first place and you can't 
reach more people! But if you add your name on the 3rd 
place, there will be tons of people receiving E-Mails 
with your name first later!!! 

If you choose to, you can replace the PayPal referring URL 
in the body of the letter with your own PayPal url. 

              Lets Begin
Send out 20 copies or more of this letter. More is better. 

ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via 
E-MAIL, the response time is much faster... ELECTRONIC 
TRANSFER - INTERNET FAST!  CONSIDER THIS, MILLIONS of 
people surf the Internet everyday all over the world! 

Here are the 3 e-mail addresses to start with. 

Send $5.00 to the first person!!! 

                Here are 3 e-Mail Addresses

******************************************************* 
1. tim_constable@hotmail.com
2. a5004@yahoo.com
3. andyo@prodigy.net

******************************************************* 

Fifty thousand new people get on the Internet every 
month! An excellent source of names is the people who 
send you other programs and the names listed on the 
letter they send you. Your contact source is UNLIMITED! 
Send your $5 payment TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of 
your time, THAT'S IT! 

                   General Instructions

To send this message by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE 
PAGE and paste it in the message of your E-Mail. 

Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the top 
name, adding your name and address to the bottom of the 
list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, YOUR 
NAME goes on the BOTTOM and move the other 2 names 
up. But DO NOT forget to send $5.00 by PayPal (along with 
your note) to the TOP E-MAIL address before deleting it! 

NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in this 
e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.  When your name 
reaches the first position in a few days, it will be your 
turn to collect your MONEY! The money will be sent to 
you by 2,000 to 4,000 people like yourself, who are willing 
to invest one hour to receive $20,000 in cash! 

That's all! There will be a total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills
in your PayPal account in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's 
work! This is real money that you can spend on anything 
you wish! Just deposit it to your own bank account or spend 
it directly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that 
easy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you? 

GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4 
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? IF YOU TRY IT, IT 
WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF COURSE YOU CAN---
this plan is structured for everyone to send only 20 
letters each. However, you are certainly not limited to 
20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters you 
send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can E-MAIL 
forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! THE MORE 
YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! 

Each time you run this program, just follow steps 1 
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! Simple 
enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no mailing 
lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the printer or 
copier, and you can do it again and again with your 
regular groups or gift givers, or start up a new group. 

Be SURE and PAY the first person on the list. This is 
proof that you paid to get put on the list which is the 
service rendered to make all this legal!!! Why not? 
It beats working! 

            Step by Step e-Mail Instruction

After you pay the first person on the list, remove 
the person's name, and move #2 person to the vacant #1 
position, move #3 person to #2 position and put yourself 
in the new #3 position and then e-mail out this letter.  
 
Send out a couple e-mails of this letter and your name 
will climb to the number one position at dizzying rates. 
Follow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE 
PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. Your 
name must run the full gamut on the list to produce the 
end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list 
WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats 
the other people who have worked hard and have earned 
the right to be there. So please, play by the rules and 
the $$$ will come to you! TRUST each OTHER, be FAIR 
and everyone that actively participates will make money

$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will 
prosper! GOOD LUCK $$$ 

You are probably skeptical of this, especially with all the 
different programs out there on the web, but if you don't 
try this you will never know. That's the way I felt. I've 
been watching this type of program for years and this is 
about as easy and fast as you can get it and it can even 
be free so try now with PayPal, no stamps, no envelopes, no 
copies to be made - just a little effort and FAITH!!! 
This program has really "Kept It Short and Simple"! 

Let's all SUPPORT each OTHER and make serious money $$$$$ 

CLICK HERE TO BEGIN: 
  https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=andyo%40prodigy.net

Please just play by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but 
your time and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS. 

         GOOD LUCK.!!!!!  THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!

History:

Markus is getting a PHP crash when he loads the php_gtk.dll either via a script or \
via php.ini, using either the 0.1a or his own recent build.  He is running another \
PHP 4.0 exe on this w2k box, which he uses for web work with Apache and mysql - the \
systems are kept apart, he's traced the dependencies and all seems fine on that \
score.  (nb this is not his normal set-up.)  He thinks it's a dll version problem.

I'm on win98, and have a similar set-up to the one Markus describes as my 'norm'; \
I've had problems getting the web PHP/apache/mysql system to work for some months \
now, which I initially blamed on Apache.  It's not Apache; when my system starts to \
freeze up (and my entire system does eventually freeze, I'm on win32 not win32s) I \
can't do anything but a full power-down to escape it, because php.exe is reportedly \
still running in the background .. ad infinitum..  Also, I can access my htm files \
fine via localhost, but not my php files.  I've noticed that if I try to access the \
Internet while I'm running a php-gtk application - even just my fileopener button on \
standby - pages won't load, and IE5.5 appears to freeze.  If I shut down the php-gtk \
app and php.exe, everything works again.

It all worked fine prior to php-gtk ... but as with Markus, my versions are kept well \
apart, so there shouldn't be a way they can know about each other.

I'm following my nose and a tentative lead regarding Mozilla vs gtk/gdk on the gtk \
list.

Thoughts, anyone?

Hi MArkus,

I'm unable to reproduce this on my system for both Release_TS and Debug_TS builds.

Perhaps my cvs version (of php) is slightly newer than the copy you use ?

- Frank


&gt; With current CVS (both PHP and PHP-GTK) I get the following crash
&gt; as soon as php_gtk.dll calls gtk_init_check(). I think writing
&gt; down the error messages from the error box isn't useful anyway.
&gt; Here is the call stack:

below is the current working config.m4 for gtkhtml widget..

It uses gnome-config --cflags gtkhtml etc. to get the dependances.

one of the problems it does have is that libgtkhtml exports GTKHTML_HAVE_GCONF as a \
-D on the --cflags output, 

using PHP_EVAL_INCLINE($GTKHTML_CFLAGS) strips out the above flags at compile time.. \
- so i have had to hack a grep and AC_DEFINE to replace it..

Ideas to make that cleaner would be nice..

anyway working code below..

Thanks for your help..

can you send me a copy of
1. the php file to display the editor
2. the modification to the defs file.

also
what version of the gtkhtml + gtk are you using?
eg.
gtk-config --version gtk
gnome-config --modversion gtkhtml

It would be nice to get it working here :)

alan

Alan,

	Any change of you putting that up as a tar file for the rest of
us to play with?. I have your original work but load_from_string() is
undefined.

thanks,
--rdp

&gt;Thanks to Mark, the simple answer to why it was segfaulting was..

&gt;Code A will cause a segfault, code B wont - This is probably due to the
&gt;definition of \
&gt;the Object (object HTML 
&gt;  (in-module Gtk)
&gt;  (parent Frame   (Gtk))
&gt;  (c-name GtkHTML)
&gt;A)
&gt;where it's parent must be a frame
&gt;
&gt;- There is now a HTML editor + viewer in PHP-GTK :)
&gt;

this is the modification to the html.defs file.

Note the second parameter is the string length - I will probably remove that from the \
next version - as the calc could be done in C - and the method would be clearer to \
end users...

Hopefully, I will get some time in the next few evenings to complete more of the \
port. (especially the editor component)

&gt; Alan,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any change of you putting that up as a tar file for the rest of
&gt; us to play with?. I have your original work but load_from_string() is
&gt; undefined.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks to Mark, the simple answer to why it was segfaulting was..
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Code A will cause a segfault, code B wont - This is probably due to the

&gt; &gt; the Object (object HTML 
&gt; &gt; (in-module Gtk)

With current CVS (both PHP and PHP-GTK) I get the following crash
as soon as php_gtk.dll calls gtk_init_check(). I think writing
down the error messages from the error box isn't useful anyway.
Here is the call stack:

I'm running the debug build, php.exe NOT php_win.exe. You'll
probabely say its a GTK+ win32 problem but I didn't had this
problem so far.

I also get a 'Debug Assertion Failed' when running
'php.exe -f file_exists_or_not.php':

The particular note in this source file is:

Hi All,

I'm doing all my (win32) development on Windows 2000 and I use IIS 5, IE and Netscape \
prowsers and I have no problems using both Web and GTK applications on the same box, \
at the same time.

I have only one copy of each php file (php.exe, php4ts.dll, php4isapi.dll and all the \
extension dll's) Everything is installed in d:\php4 and all my script mappings piont \
to either php.exe or php4isapi.dll (in different directories)

Windows do some wierd things with DLL's. If you have one system loading php4ts.dll \
(apache or iis) and you try to load the same dll from another program (php.exe) you \
might end up using the wrong copy as it is allready in memory. This might be the \
reson for the problems.

I have just recompiled from latest cvs and both the Release_TS and Debug_TS builds \
works fine on my system.

If you want fresh compiled binariews I'll be happy to mail copies of my files to you.

- Frank

&gt; History:
&gt; 
&gt; Markus is getting a PHP crash when he loads the php_gtk.dll either via a script or \
&gt; via php.ini, using either the 0.1a or his own recent build.  He is running another \
&gt; PHP 4.0 exe on this w2k box, which he uses for web work with Apache and mysql - the \
&gt; systems are kept apart, he's traced the dependencies and all seems fine on that \
&gt; score.  (nb this is not his normal set-up.)  He thinks it's a dll version problem. 
&gt; I'm on win98, and have a similar set-up to the one Markus describes as my 'norm'; \
&gt; I've had problems getting the web PHP/apache/mysql system to work for some months \
&gt; now, which I initially blamed on Apache.  It's not Apache; when my system starts to \
&gt; freeze up (and my entire system does eventually freeze, I'm on win32 not win32s) I \
&gt; can't do anything but a full power-down to escape it, because php.exe is reportedly \
&gt; still running in the background .. ad infinitum..  Also, I can access my htm files \
&gt; fine via localhost, but not my php files.  I've noticed that if I try to access the \
&gt; Internet while I'm running a php-gtk application - even just my fileopener button \
&gt; on standby - pages won't load, and IE5.5 appears to freeze.  If I shut down the \
&gt; php-gtk app and php.exe, everything works again. 
&gt; It all worked fine prior to php-gtk ... but as with Markus, my versions are kept \
&gt; well apart, so there shouldn't be a way they can know about each other. 
&gt; I'm following my nose and a tentative lead regarding Mozilla vs gtk/gdk on the gtk \
&gt; list. 
&gt; Thoughts, anyone?

Hi, just a "one" line introduction : I picked up PHP-GTK earlier this
week (after many years of PHP development) for migrating a PHP based
webapp to a GUI environment. So far it has been an enlightenment :)

To speed up development, and not to waste time on implementing GUI stuff
manually, I quickly switched to Glade, which has proven a real time
saver.

I hope to dig into the PHP-GTK (and Glade) stuff as deep as possible,
which usually tends to bring up "issues". After quickly searching the
archives I haven't found any mentioning of this problem, so here it
goes...

When adding and icon to menu items, using the xml file generated causes
Gtk errors...

&lt;snip&gt;
** WARNING **: unknown widget class 'GtkPixmapMenuItem'

Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_accel_group_add(): could not find signal
"activate"in the `GtkLabel' class ancestry

Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkmenushell.c: line 310 (gtk_menu_shell_insert):
assertion `GTK_IS_MENU_ITEM (child)' failed.

Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_signal_connect_full(): could not find signal
"activate" in the `GtkLabel' class ancestry
&lt;/snip&gt;

Is this (the missing GtkPixMapMenuItem) a known issue, is someone
looking into this and/or is this something you would welcome if it were
pathced and submitted to the list?

(and as a reminder ... the VirtualHost entry on gtk.php.net is still
missing ;-) )

greetz,

Christophe VG

I have an updated file uploaded for the gtkhtml module . (now in an a dir called html \
- reduces alot of the naming conflict probs I was having.)

http://midgard.hklc.com/gtkhtml.1.1.tgz

I'm still getting the segfaults on the  gtk_layout_get_type in libgtk-1.2.so, (see \
earlier mail) my assumption is that this is recieving somehow the pointer to the \

Anyway other than this - I think the code is very close - if somebody could play with \
it for a few mins...  :)

Thanks to Mark, the simple answer to why it was segfaulting was..

Code A will cause a segfault, code B wont - This is probably due to the definition of \
the Object (object HTML 
  (in-module Gtk)
  (parent Frame   (Gtk))
  (c-name GtkHTML)
)
where it's parent must be a frame

- There is now a HTML editor + viewer in PHP-GTK :)

Alan, I'd love to play with it, but I've got my time totally allocated to 
previous engagements... And I need to make the next release of PHP-GTK. 
Hopefully, I'll get to this next week or so.

Hi,
	I've been wanting to play with gtkhtml in php-gtk for a while now..nice
work :)
	I've been able to use your code to successfully load a web page
(google.com) after i implemented gtk_html_load_from_string in html.defs.
	Just thought you'de like to know :) I look forward to further
development on this, so i can write a php-gtk browser.

Thanks

Just thought i'd post a link to some screenshots of the browser i've
done so far.
http://slashdot.co.uk/pHTML.html

It shows the main window and also it's _basic_ built in php editor that
can preview php code inline.

Eh, that's because GtkPixmapMenuItem is part of GNOME libraries and they
are not supported as of yet.

I'd like to test GdkRGB functionality and then add GdkPixbuf support.
And also GtkGLArea. Past that, the next thing would probably be GNOME
support.

One of the main things now, though, would be making the online manual
usable. So if you want to help with that, it would be appreciated.

Looks like we found a way to make my experiments helpful to the project.
How do we go about this?

Step one will probably be: make the online manual "online" again ;-)

Hmm ... for me its always crashing in MSVCRT.DLL ... maybe I've a
problem there (I hope so ;)

&gt; I have only one copy of each php file (php.exe, php4ts.dll,
&gt; php4isapi.dll and all the extension dll's) Everything is
&gt; installed in d:\php4 and all my script mappings piont to either
&gt; php.exe or php4isapi.dll (in different directories)
&gt; 
&gt; Windows do some wierd things with DLL's. If you have one system
&gt; loading php4ts.dll (apache or iis) and you try to load the same
&gt; dll from another program (php.exe) you might end up using the
&gt; wrong copy as it is allready in memory. This might be the reson
&gt; for the problems.

I even tried it with a) shuttung down apache b) shutting down
apache, renaming where it is instalied with its *dll files and
restart the computer so I'm 100% sure it isn't executed on next
startup. But since I'm using dependencywalker which already tells
me which php4ts.dll my php.exe loads I'm sure the right
php4ts.dll gets loaded.

&gt; I have just recompiled from latest cvs and both the Release_TS
&gt; and Debug_TS builds works fine on my system.

Now thats a bit strange. Even on my system at home, which is imho
a clean system because I can successfully compile most of the
things, I get a crash when using the debug build of PHP-GTK. It,
again, crashes somewhere in MSVCRT.DLL from a call from GTK+.


&gt; If you want fresh compiled binariews I'll be happy to mail
&gt; copies of my files to you.

I'ld be pleased to test them. From now on I'll try anything
because I'll love nothing more than finding a way to develop
php-gtk @ work :)

ty,
	Markus

ps: Just for completeness; can you tell me which MSVCRT.DLL
version number, filesize and file location do you have?

At home I have:
Location:	C:\WINNT\system32
Size: 		284 KB (290.869 Bytes)

With current CVS (both PHP and PHP-GTK) I get the following crash
as soon as php_gtk.dll calls gtk_init_check(). I think writing
down the error messages from the error box isn't useful anyway.
Here is the call stack:

I'm running the debug build, php.exe NOT php_win.exe. You'll
probabely say its a GTK+ win32 problem but I didn't had this
problem so far.

I also get a 'Debug Assertion Failed' when running
'php.exe -f file_exists_or_not.php':

Found in gtk+1.3.9 dev gtkpaned.h

#ifndef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
#define gtk_paned_gutter_size(p,s)  (void) 0
#define gtk_paned_set_gutter_size(p,s)  (void) 0
#define gtk_paned_handle_size   gtk_paned_set_handle_size
#endif /* GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED */

I think that particular problem may quietly go away :) so really whatever solution \
you guys put into place for it should only need to be a temporary fix.

I'm covering gtkpaned &amp; co for the manual as of now, so will make mention of the \
future deprecations.

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] Splitting ext/gtk+/gtk.defs


How do we solve the problem with e.g. gutter_size not defined on
win32? Splitting the gtk.defs file in gtk.defs and
gtk.defs.win32 or having a way to override a definition from the
gtk.defs file?

- Markus
