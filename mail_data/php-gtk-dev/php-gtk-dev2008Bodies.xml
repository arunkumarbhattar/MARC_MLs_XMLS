&gt; I _think_ I'm there - as in, everything appears to build as expected

&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth, do you have the coverage output from the build logs handy for
&gt; 2.10?

Looks the same Steph - did you change the defines thing for shared
extensions too?  AFAIK that was the big issue (the *nix system wants to
define things differently for DL builds than the windows system...not
good).  Throw it up into cvs and I'll give it a round of compiles.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

I look into this once I get some free time. I'm quite busy at work right
now. It's simple though, you just need to allow the name have hyphen in
it. Propably just changing this line in zend_ini_scanner.l:

LABEL [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._]*

to

LABEL [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*

No time to test right now. :)

&gt; I went to fix the shared build issue on *nix and discovered we can't load 
&gt; PHP-GTK extensions in 5.3.0 even under Windows. Hyphens are illegal syntax 
&gt; in INI directives now. (I know this because an old 5.3-dev told me so - the 
&gt; current message is rather less helpful, it just says 'parse error'.)
&gt; 
&gt; Renaming our INI directives to use underscores doesn't work because the

&gt; 
&gt; Jani, can you assist?

This is broken for me on both Linux and FreeBSD 7. Using this tarball and 
running a program I have written results in:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method bobNotebook::set_tab_reorderable()

My program launches, the window shows, GTK is doing things, so it is working 
sort of. But then it crashes with that error. I go back to the CVS tree, and 
this problem goes away. `make install` this, comes back. `make install` in cvs, 
goes away, `make install` this... etc etc etc. So I am pretty sure it is not my 
fault.

class bobNotebook extends GtkNotebook {
	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct();
		$this-&gt;set_scrollable(true);
		$this-&gt;show_all();
		return;
	}
}

Also at /least/ the sourceview shared library is broken. When 
--with-sourceview=shared

/usr/bin/php: symbol lookup error:
usr/lib/php/extensions/php_gtk_sourceview.so:
undefined symbol: gtk_source_style_scheme_get_type

But I have had linking problems with the PHP-GTK shared objects in the past that 
Anant could not replicate... but this one is slightly different I think. Anant, 
I am poking you with a stick.

Did you run buildconf or just configure?

Can you run "make clean-gen" and then do buildconf, configure, and build?

This package bundles generated files based on what I had installed, 
which is Gtk+ 2.8, so something might be wrong there.

`make clean-gen` did it on both Linux and FreeBSD, it is now useable.

http://www.opsat.net/temp/jenny-freebsd.jpg

However it did not fix the linking problem I had with shared GtkSourceview. only 
works when compiled in directly.

Description:
------------
Currently, php-gtk tries to find (pkg-config) a suitable mozilla
install searching for firefox or mozilla packages, automatically
skipping if not found.

The attached patch changes this by also looking for xulrunner. I needed
it in order to compile php-gtk with mozembed on Debian.

Additionally, it fixes the README documentation outdated by v1.3 of
config.m4

You know, as many gtk versions as we support (2.6, 2.8, 2.10, and 2.12)
and as many as run in the wild in linux distros it might be a smart idea
NOT to distribute already generated files, since the files will
automatically change depending on the version of gtk on the person's
machine.

Builds and appears to run fine with windows (but the win build system
always regenerates source ;).  I have a build ready to go, with
gtksourceview and libglade extensions.  I also have gtkhtml building but
it needs so many dependencies I have that in a different package.  I
couldn't find prebuilt libs for the others and don't have time to build
them right now, so things like the svg pixbuf loader, libsexy, gtkextra,
scintilla, and gtkspell will have to wait until I get some libraries.
Core and the extensions that build appear to work (I don't have a good
gtkhtml test, anyone care to write one?)

Yes, I realized that. I had those files being bundled in makedist when 
we didn't have support for multiple versions, but now that we do, it 
does not make sense, as you said.

Ok. Can you check the Windows builds into php-gtk-web/distributions?

I've edited relevant php-gtk-web pages here and going to commit them 
before I leave work (just so I hold myself to the promise of releasing 
on February 29).

We should probably restructure downloads page so that we have separate 
sections for PHP-GTK 1 and 2 and also development and stable release 
sections for PHP-GTK 2.

Anant, you can update links in the index.php announcement if you want. I 
think I found most of them, but feel free..

I just finished setting up a Kubuntu 7.10 box, and decided I'd give this 
a shot. 

My Linux is pretty basic, but we're getting more requests from our 
clients that were previously early WinX to go to Linux, instead of 
disastros like XP and Vista.  So this seemed like a good time to tryout 
the installation process.

I tried to follow the install instructions for PHP in the PHP-Gtk2 
manual, but I couldn't make it past the PHP part.  Multiple errors with 
gcc, automake, etc.  So I switched to Synaptic and installed PHP 5.2.3, 
with the mysql extensions.  That went fine.

Then I tried to run a buildconf on the file you gave, but it's a no go. 
AFAICT, it's unhappy about the location for phpize.  Out of time and 
patience by now, even though I know it's probably something simple, I 
have to give up.

I totally realize that this is probably my lack of expertise and time.  
And eventually, I'll find the answers and update the install page.  But 
it does seem that in terms of an average user trying to make it work on 
an 'out of the box' distribution install, I'd say - not.

Maybe we can get Ubuntu to add it to their repositories....


FWIW,

&gt; This package bundles generated files based on what I had installed,

I know bob had an installer working on ubuntu flavors - might want to
make something like that available for the linux newcomers.

ubuntu - does kubuntu have the needed gtk libs?  Thought that was all
qt, kde based)

I will be out all Saturday EST time in Chicago tomorrow, so a 2.0.0 official 
release super uber mega spectacular "installer" will probably be up monday.

If you wanna try it now just to see if it works, I would suggest it. Though 
really the current version for linux is actually up to date I think, just named 
old as it was a CVS release at the time. Else on that same site i have a 
tutorial for compiling, and if you are able to do that, that should work just as 
well. The compiling tutorial is pretty detailed in the packages you need to 
install, did that special for Ubuntu. Being on Kubuntu you might need to add a 
libgtk-2.0-dev or something to the list.

KateOS probably will not update for some time still. As with every milestone, I 
have to spend a good deal of time selling the lead to include it in the 
repository :)

I hope what I said made sense. I think it did. Just got home. Night night.

I will be creating some new debs for ubuntu 7.10 only that will install
php-gtk on any ubuntu 7.10 based distro (k/x/ed)
Might be nice to have the deb's available from the php-gtk download section.

OK I'll mess with some core extension that's easier to test for demo 
purposes. I've a weekly to write first tho'...

Thanks for that. Wish I'd seen it before I updated the bug report.

Yep, that works. Attached is a patch containing your fix + a test with

There are also a couple of trivial ZE fixes in the patch that may or may not

Hi Jani,

OK, those GC/build fixes are in CVS now (Dmitry/Stas awake).

Your fix + test with ext/date attached, should apply to 5_3 locally without 
pain. I don't think there's any way to write a phpt test for this one 
though, since there are no hyphens in the core INI directives.

- Steph

Why do you change those ext/date/ directives???

And it doesn't matter if a directive is registered or not. It's
perfectly valid to set any own values in php.ini. If you look at the
existing tests, you'll see what I mean. :D
For example:

ext/standard/tests/general_functions/parse_ini_basic.data

Because that's an easy way to prove your fix works and I was trying to save 
you five minutes?

&gt; And it doesn't matter if a directive is registered or not. It's
&gt; perfectly valid to set any own values in php.ini. If you look at the
&gt; existing tests, you'll see what I mean. :D
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt; ext/standard/tests/general_functions/parse_ini_basic.data

Hm - does that test setting INI values, or parsing INI-style data? Would it 
work with ini_get() and friends, for example?

/me would test but is in the middle of something else right now

Hiya,

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth, do you have the coverage output from the build logs handy for
&gt;&gt; 2.10?
&gt;
&gt; Looks the same Steph - did you change the defines thing for shared
&gt; extensions too?

I was going to ask you what you meant by that... now's as good a time as any 
I guess. What exactly do you mean by that? :)

&gt; AFAIK that was the big issue (the *nix system wants to
&gt; define things differently for DL builds than the windows system...not
&gt; good).  Throw it up into cvs and I'll give it a round of compiles.

Thanks, I've still some edge-smoothing and testing to do here (+ two 
seething bosses to appease @ present) but will get them into the repository 
later today.

- Steph

&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Elizabeth

&gt; 

Windows defines it as (for example) COMPILE_DL_HTML2 and nix defines it
as PHP_GTK_DL_HTML2 or something like that - I don't have time to look
it up at the moment but there was a thread on the mailing list about it.
 So right now you can't compile php-gtk extensions shared on nix.

From:             Keisial at gmail dot com
Operating system: Debian etch
PHP version:      5.2.6
PHP Bug Type:     PHP-GTK related
Bug description:  Allow php-gtk to detect the mozembed widget from xulrunner.

Description:
------------
Currently, php-gtk tries to find (pkg-config) a suitable mozilla install
searching for firefox or mozilla packages, automatically skipping if not
found.

The attached patch changes this by also looking for xulrunner. I needed it
in order to compile php-gtk with mozembed on Debian.

Additionally, it fixes the README documentation outdated by v1.3 of
config.m4

Description:
------------
Currently, php-gtk tries to find (pkg-config) a suitable mozilla
install searching for firefox or mozilla packages, automatically
skipping if not found.

The attached patch changes this by also looking for xulrunner. I needed
it in order to compile php-gtk with mozembed on Debian.

Additionally, it fixes the README documentation outdated by v1.3 of
config.m4

&gt; These are the default X.11 arguments: --display, for instance, allows
&gt; the application to display a remote display, different from the one it
&gt; was started on.

&gt;&gt; Hiya Andrei,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any ideas? The reason gtk_init() needs argc/argv is to parse out 
&gt;&gt;&gt; options like --display, etc. If we are willing to remove support for 
&gt;&gt;&gt; those options, then we can call gtk_init() with argc=0, argv=NULL and 
&gt;&gt;&gt; have it in MINIT.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Could you please clarify where '--display, etc' are used? As in, which 
&gt;&gt; scenarios?

Bug description:  Codepage Error on Windows 2000

Description:
------------
I've installed PHP-GTK2.0.0 on two different Windows 2000 NT systems. One
system uses codepage 850 and everything works fine. On the other system
codepage 437 is installed and I adjusted the php-cli.ini to this codepage.

On the the Windows 2000 NT with codepage 437 the demo applications are not
working properly.

I tried the ComboBox-Selector (PHP-Gtk2-Demo). When I click on "Check
this" the program crashes.The demo also crashes, when I click on the
StockItemBrowserDemo in the main menu.

The codepage setting is right and I'm not using any keys to navigate.

---------------

 New Comment:

The caveat with using windows codepages is 
"so long as the encoding format you choose is capable of iconv
conversion" - the warning you're getting from gtk means whatever you're
feeding to the iconv conversion is failing - hence the issue.

Did you have this problem with the beta version of PHP-GTK2?

Do you have errors if you leave the codepage at CP1252 or even 850?  It
might have incorrect characters for higher level ascii values, but the
base is the same.

Are you certain that is the codepage the system is set to for that
user?


Some additional information:
The "official" windows builds of the gtk libraries I've been using are
no longer using a real libiconv, instead they're using a stripped down
windows version that "fakes" iconv functionality, which might be where
the issues are coming from.  However, fixing this means I need to finish
compiling custom versions of gtk, a big project.

 New Comment:

Hey,

I haven't tried the php-gtk beta version. So I used the 2.0.0 version
and today I updated to the 2.0.1 version. The problem still exists. The
exceptions throws either with codepage 850, CP1252 or codepage 437. 

I inserted a phpinfo right ahead of the demoscript to check the
settings:

***********
PHP Version =&gt; 5.2.5
System =&gt; Windows NT HRM 5.0 build 2195

[...]

RegisteredStreamFilters =&gt; convert.iconv.*,[...]

[...]

php-gtk

GTK+ support =&gt; enabled
GTK+ v =&gt; 2.12.9

php.gtk.codepage =&gt; 437 =&gt; 437

[...]

iconv

iconv support =&gt; enabled
iconv implementation =&gt; "libiconv"
iconv library version =&gt; 1.9

iconv.input_encoding =&gt; ISO-8859-1 =&gt; ISO-8859-1
iconv.internal_encoding =&gt; ISO-8859-1 =&gt; ISO-8859-1
iconv.output_encoding =&gt; ISO-8859-1 =&gt; ISO-8859-1

***************

Do I need to set the iconv.input_encoding manually? I guess php-gtk2 is
taking care of it, doesn't it?

The windows active codepage is '437' as the command "chcp" tells me
right before I execute the script.

This seems not to be a problem of PHP-Gtk2.

Today I installed the newest Windows 2000 NT updates. Afterwards
everything worked just fine! So I guess it's the buggy Windows NT ;)

Thanks for your effort!

Hey,

I haven't tried the php-gtk beta version. So I used the 2.0.0 version
and today I updated to the 2.0.1 version. The problem still exists. The
exceptions throws either with codepage 850, CP1252 or codepage 437. 

I inserted a phpinfo right ahead of the demoscript to check the
settings:

***********
PHP Version =&gt; 5.2.5
System =&gt; Windows NT HRM 5.0 build 2195

[...]

RegisteredStreamFilters =&gt; convert.iconv.*,[...]

[...]

php-gtk

GTK+ support =&gt; enabled
GTK+ v =&gt; 2.12.9

php.gtk.codepage =&gt; 437 =&gt; 437

[...]

iconv

iconv support =&gt; enabled
iconv implementation =&gt; "libiconv"
iconv library version =&gt; 1.9

iconv.input_encoding =&gt; ISO-8859-1 =&gt; ISO-8859-1
iconv.internal_encoding =&gt; ISO-8859-1 =&gt; ISO-8859-1
iconv.output_encoding =&gt; ISO-8859-1 =&gt; ISO-8859-1

***************

Do I need to set the iconv.input_encoding manually? I guess php-gtk2 is
taking care of it, doesn't it?

The windows active codepage is '437' as the command "chcp" tells me
right before I execute the script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-05-16 15:06:40] auroraeosrose@php.net

The caveat with using windows codepages is 
"so long as the encoding format you choose is capable of iconv
conversion" - the warning you're getting from gtk means whatever you're
feeding to the iconv conversion is failing - hence the issue.

Did you have this problem with the beta version of PHP-GTK2?

Do you have errors if you leave the codepage at CP1252 or even 850?  It
might have incorrect characters for higher level ascii values, but the
base is the same.

Are you certain that is the codepage the system is set to for that
user?


Some additional information:
The "official" windows builds of the gtk libraries I've been using are
no longer using a real libiconv, instead they're using a stripped down
windows version that "fakes" iconv functionality, which might be where
the issues are coming from.  However, fixing this means I need to finish
compiling custom versions of gtk, a big project.

Description:
------------
I've installed PHP-GTK2.0.0 on two different Windows 2000 NT systems.
One system uses codepage 850 and everything works fine. On the other
system codepage 437 is installed and I adjusted the php-cli.ini to this
codepage.

On the the Windows 2000 NT with codepage 437 the demo applications are
not working properly.

I tried the ComboBox-Selector (PHP-Gtk2-Demo). When I click on "Check
this" the program crashes.The demo also crashes, when I click on the
StockItemBrowserDemo in the main menu.

The codepage setting is right and I'm not using any keys to navigate.

Reproduce code:
---------------
see example code of demos from Windows binary pack -
http://gtk.php.net/download.php

--------------

Hey,

For all you Mac users out there, I've made an installer for the latest  
stable version of PHP-GTK. It installs all the pre-requisites for PHP- 
GTK so you can get started as quickly as possible. That's not all, the  
applications will also run without an X server, and present a really  
nice Aqua interface (thanks to the wonderful folks at Imendio for  
writing a Quartz backend for GTK+)

Grab it from: http://www.kix.in/php-gtk2/PHP-GTK-2.0.0.dmg (33MB - The  
size is a little big because of the mammoth number of dependencies  
that both PHP and GTK+ have). The installer will work only on Intel  
Macs - OS X versions 10.4 and 10.5 only.

Cheers,
Anant

If this came up already and I missed it, apologies.

I can install the package on WinX just fine and run the demo.  But I'm
not having any luck getting MySQL working.  I rummaged about the
internet and manage to find a current extension file, but I still get an
'unable to initialize' error for the module.  AFACT, the difference is
in the compiled thread safety: 1 for MySQL and 0 for the php-gtk.

Any suggestions?  I have no way to compile the php in WinX.

thanks,
Madeleine D.

We're working on an experimental run to see if we can move our Gtk1 code 
into Gtk2 with the minimum amount of changes.  The time required for a 
complete rewrite simply does not exist.

It's going a lot better than we thought, but ran into something that may 
or may not be a failing issue.  I realize that GtkClist is deprecated, 
but our entire app runs on it.  The existing Clists are all loading 
fine, but when we try to get the selection property in Gtk2, it comes up 
empty.

Did this property get ignored because the widget is deprecated, or ????

thanks,
Madeleine D.

Generation logs say
reader for  GtkCList-&gt;selection: unknown type 'GList*'

so it needs an override to work - someone have a minute to write one?
Should be pretty easy -&gt; glist to array conversions are fairly brainless.

As of the PHP-GTK 2.0.0 release (Feb 29) the language binding has at
least partial support for gtk versions up through 2.12 - some functions
are still missing but coverage is at more than 90%.

The support available can vary if compiled with an older version of the

such as the windows version provided, have support for the 2.12 gtk release.

Could we please be re-added to the language bindings page?

Please let me know when you're done with the 2.10 and 2.12 bindings.

Hi

If you activate php_gtk in "/etc/php.ini" you will be unable to use
php for cron-jobs and shellscripts over ssh even until you diable it!

I can not believe taht im the only person who uses php for shellscripting :-)

Hello,

I've been using the Reflection API to automatically build a PHP skeleton 
file of all PHP-GTK elements, in order to enable code completion for 
PHP-GTK in Eclipse PDT, and probably any other PHP IDE since it would 
look like just any ordinary PHP file.

However, in doing so, I've encountered what seem to be a few anomalies:
(a) PHP-GTK classes return empty results on the 
getExtension()/getExtensionName() methods, unlike those in other extensions
(b) some methods bear names which are reserved PHP words, and cannot 
therefore be declared as such. These reserved words are
   - "foreach"
     - PhpGtkCustomTreeModel
     - GtkListStore
     - GtkTextTagTable
     - GtkTreeModelFilter
     - GtkTreeModelSort
     - GtkTreeStore
     - GtkSourceTagTableand
   - "unset"
     - GtkPrintSettings

These do not cause errors or even warnings on runtime, and indeed 
discussion on #php suggests it may be legit for an extension to define 
methods bearing the names of reserved words of the language, but it is 
unadvised.

However, it prevents extending these classes in PHP by inheriting and 
redefining these methods, since defining such extensions results in a 
compile error. Since these methods are not marked with the "final" 
modifier, they should be inheritable, so this seems to be a bug indeed.

(c) none of the methods supports the getPrototype() method, which causes 
an exception upon invokation. I'm not sure of the status of this 
methods, since it is listed in the PHP classbrowser:
http://www.php.net/~helly/classbrowser/class.php?class=ReflectionMethod&amp;extension=Reflection
but not on the normal Reflection page:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.reflection.php#language.oop5.reflection.reflectionmethod

Hi,

I see Andrei tagged the next php-gtk version and I know I did a LOT of
overrides and support stuff in CVS.  With PHP 5.2.6 out the door I'd
like to do a release shortly, but before we do I'd love to get
GtkCList-&gt;selection wrapped for Madeleine - anyone want to take up that
one simple override? (It's moving a glist to an array but I'm very busy atm)

Any other opinions on a new release?

If anyone is interested I've been working through the gtk docs and
mapping them to PHP support to weed out bad overrides, bad/missing
ignores, and missing defs (there were quite a few)  I have 2.12, 2.10,
2.8, 2.6, 2.4, and 2.2 new symbols done and I'm working on 2.0 and
deprecated symbols.  Anyone who wants to see the status it's at

callicore.net/php-gtk/code-coverage-status.html

Gray items are ignored and red items are missing, and it's only for gtk.
 Glib, pango, ATK, et al are not done (yet).

Also if someone has some time, I think the unixprint support (gtk 2.10+,
the beautiful green color) would work best as a php-gtk2 extension -
anyone have the time and/or energy to get that set up?

Thanks,
Elizabeth Smith

Hey Elizabeth,

I just rolled php-gtk-2.0.1 tarball and put it in distributions/ on php-gtk-web. 
I think we should juts go ahead and release and we can make 2.0.2 include the 
GTKClist-&gt;selection stuff. I'd really us to have much more frequent releases.

Can someone please update the front, download, and changelog pages for the new 
release?

The code coverage stuff looks good, thanks for going through all that stuff.

I hope to continue work on virtual methods soon, which will allow for custom 
cell renderers.

I suggest GtkPrintSettings be made an alias (for compatibility) but the
real function be named in a way that makes it overwriteable (although at
this stage I wonder what one would wan't to overwrite it for).

Regarding the foreach() ones, I think this is just an unlucky naming,
but should be easily changeable since these functions are only for
internal use (aren't they?) and not part of the normal GTK API.

Florian,

Not sure why you say they are not part of the "normal" Gtk API. They 
appear to be listed just like any other method:

Indeed you are right for GtkTextTagTable and GtkPrintSettings. Different
it is for GtkListStore and GtkTreeModelFilter which I cannot find any
foreach-method defined for, though. GtkSourceTagTable is inheriting it
from GtkTextTagTable. Didn't check them all when I read your message,
sorry. However, I suggest the same apply to them than as for the
unset-one, though I think perhaps it would be better we'd set up a
general rule on how to approach such conflicts now and in future?

Kind regards,

Florian

we have heard all of this before. i know it because i said it.
&lt;insert the most giant tounge sticking out emoticon in the world.&gt;

 From Configuring PHP for GTK
&lt;http://oops.opsat.net/doc/gtk/configure-php.html&gt;:

==============================
Why a PHP-GTK Config?

On Unix based systems, it is a good idea to have a separate
PHP config file just for GTK. Why?

* Not all command line programs need GTK.
   Why waste time loading the GTK library if the command
   line program is not even going to to use it? With PHP
   you need all the speed you can get.

* Apache Will Die.
   GTK connects to the window manager when loaded. Apache
   does not have access to any window manager, therefore GTK
   will kill Apache. Apache = Web. GTK = Local.

* Your SSH sessions could break. Over SSH you generally are
not using GUI applications, even though you can with X11
forwarding. There are two problems with this. They are not
PHP-GTK problems persay, they are just generic problems with
remote shells.

    o X11 Forwarding Is Disabled.
      If this is the case you cannot use any GUI program over
      SSH. If PHP is loading GTK it will die because obviously
      it cannot find a X Session to connect with even if you are
      just using the CLI and do not even use GTK.

      [bob@kathryn ~]$ php
      Could not startup.

    o The SSH session is not 'trusted'. If the connection is not
      from what SSHD considers a 'trusted host' then GUI applications
      will be lagged, and GDK will throw errors out. This is true of
      any GTK program no matter what language it was written in. Again
      if you have PHP-GTK loaded for all CLI apps even if you do not
      need it, you will get the aforementioned GDK errors.

      [bob@kathryn ~]$ php
      (-:61599): Gdk-WARNING **: Connection to display localhost:10.0
      appears to be untrusted. Pointer and keyboard grabs and
      inter-client communication may not work as expected.

    o X11 Forwarding on a trusted session.
      This is the only time it will work right. Problem is you have to
      manually configure this in SSHD to make it happen and if you are
      not admin of the PC then you are stuck.

Moral of the story? Do not use Apache's PHP.INI, do not use the
PHP-CLI.INI. Use a special config file just for GTK. It is not hard
to setup.
==============================

Then I go on about the Unix shell hashbang, and Windows stand-alone PHP-GTK PHP 
installations.

&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you activate php_gtk in "/etc/php.ini" you will be unable to use
&gt;&gt; php for cron-jobs and shellscripts over ssh even until you diable it!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can not believe taht im the only person who uses php for
&gt;&gt; shellscripting :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; ... for windows we just dump a php-cli.ini in the same directory -
&gt; search path stuff makes this work since you'll probably use a separate
&gt; binary for cron-jobs and shell scripts on win - on nix it's a bit more
&gt; complicated
&gt; 
&gt; Any chance we can hack in a php-gtk.ini so we can totally avoid any issues?

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been using the Reflection API to automatically build a PHP skeleton

&gt; PHP-GTK in Eclipse PDT, and probably any other PHP IDE since it would 
&gt; look like just any ordinary PHP file.

Sounds good.

&gt; However, in doing so, I've encountered what seem to be a few anomalies:
&gt; (a) PHP-GTK classes return empty results on the 
&gt; getExtension()/getExtensionName() methods, unlike those in other extensions

Yeah, this needs to be fixed.

&gt; (b) some methods bear names which are reserved PHP words, and cannot 
&gt; therefore be declared as such. These reserved words are
&gt;   - "foreach"
&gt;     - PhpGtkCustomTreeModel
&gt;     - GtkListStore
&gt;     - GtkTextTagTable
&gt;     - GtkTreeModelFilter

&gt;     - GtkTreeStore
&gt;     - GtkSourceTagTableand
&gt;   - "unset"
&gt;     - GtkPrintSettings
&gt;
&gt; These do not cause errors or even warnings on runtime, and indeed

It's not a bug, but more of a mismatch between languages. Trying to redefine 
"foreach" methods is kind of useless right now, because they will not be called 
by anything, but with the upcoming virtual method support, they will be. So we 
probably should think about migrating these to a new name, possibly "for_each".

&gt; (c) none of the methods supports the getPrototype() method, which causes 
&gt; an exception upon invokation. I'm not sure of the status of this 
&gt; methods, since it is listed in the PHP classbrowser:
&gt; http://www.php.net/~helly/classbrowser/class.php?class=ReflectionMethod&amp;extension=Reflection 
&gt; 
&gt; but not on the normal Reflection page:
&gt; http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.reflection.php#language.oop5.reflection.reflectionmethod 

Hmm, I thought Christian put in a bunch of prototype descriptors in.. I'll take 
a look.

So I did some digging around ran into a catch-22. The problem is that we're 
registering all the classes in RINIT hook of PHP-GTK, and EG(current_module), 
which is used to associate the class with an extension on registration is empty 
in RINIT. We could move registration to MINIT hook, but then we don't have 
access to argc/argv which are used by gtk_init() function, since those are made 
available only in RINIT.

Any ideas? The reason gtk_init() needs argc/argv is to parse out options like 
--display, etc. If we are willing to remove support for those options, then we 
can call gtk_init() with argc=0, argv=NULL and have it in MINIT.

Hello,

I was digging through the bugs and noticed the "segfault on clone" issue
was still there.  I've been thinking that we should just hook the clone
object handler and throw an exception/ fatal error - that way people
know that you can't clone gtk objects and we don't let the engine go boom.

Any opinions on the subject? (it'd fix the bug too ;)

Thanks,
Elizabeth

This patch will throw a fatal error when someone decides to clone any

I know andrei talked about throwing an e_warning - but if it causes a

Yes I do have libatk dev installed, and
/usr/include/atk-1.0/atk/atkregistry.h 

 44 struct _AtkRegistryClass
 45 {
 46   GObjectClass    parent_class;
 47 };

So my first guess was not the problem.

./atk/atkregistry.h:49:typedef struct _AtkRegistry AtkRegistry;

Can you confirm that you have the atk dev package installed, and a
/usr/include/atk-1.0/atk/atkregistry.h containing that line above on
line 49?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-03-07 12:43:59] nhlaine at gmx dot net

libatk is 1.12.4
gen_atk.c to follow by email as req.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-03-07 03:31:17] bmajdak@php.net

This is slightly strange as we have had Debian Etch people compile
clean before. Please paste your ATK package version, and also please
email me your gen_atk.c file *after* the build fails. (tar.gz it so it
does not attach inline) to bmajdak at php dot net.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We made talk about it on IRC, I post here so others know where I stand. (LOL)

Anyway I agree, E_ERROR it instead of Segfaulting it. Cloning is useless in this 
application.

I'm working on getting all the new 2.12 stuff wrapped and working and
I've stumbled upon a strange thing

GtkNotebook allows you to set a group for a notebook, and then tabs can
be dragged and dropped between notebooks in the same group - useful
feature added in 2.10

Originally the API used a set_group_id function for this, where you'd
use an integer to identify the groups, but the GTK authors decided this
wasn't flexible enough

In 2.12 they deprecated the set_group_id and instead added a set_group.
gtk_notebook_set_group then needs a gpointer passed to identify a group
- usually this is a const char[] in the code that I've seen - a string
identifier.

How do you want to wrap this for PHP-GTK2?  Force users to pass a
string?  It's hard to see what other wrappings have done because 1.
either the pygtk generator handles gpointers transparently or 2. pygtk
doesn't support it yet (I don't know which, there's no override but it's
present in the defs) and the perl and ruby bindings don't have 2.12
support completed yet.

Any ideas for how to handle this?

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Hi,

Looks like PHP will be participating in the Summer of Code again this  
year. This might be a good opportunity to get a student to work on  
some aspect of PHP-GTK. Both Elizabeth and myself are willing to be  
mentors - we've put up a couple of ideas on http://wiki.php.net/gsoc/2008#php-gtk 
. I'll also be putting up a news item on our front page shortly.

If you know someone suitable who will be eligible to participate,  
please encourage them to send in an application!

Cheers,
Anant

 New Comment:

"Could not startup." The only time I have seen that is when doing this
over SSH and PHP-GTK is already installed. nhlaine at gmx dot net do you
also get this before it bombs?

Also as an experiment, both of you please extract a clean copy of the
source, and if you have an old version of PHP-GTK get rid of it and
comment out the reference to php_gtk.so in your PHP.INI. Also can your
SSH connections if you are doing this remotely, do it from the keyboard
with X running. If you are curious to why, check this out:

Configuring PHP and GTK
http://oops.opsat.net/doc/gtk/configure-php.html

# over ssh with php-gtk enabled.
[bob@kathryn ~]$ php
Could not startup.

Then do this on the clean source.

`./buildconf; ./configure; make`
Here you would get the error, then

`make clean-gen clean; make`
And see if that gets you through to the next round. Perhaps the
pre-generated files are mixing to do odd things.

If you still get problems, then we might be having PHP problems or some
compiler bug... recompile PHP using whatever compiler you have installed
and try again. If your PHP is currently from a package you can grab the
./configure line from PHP by asking `php -i | grep Configure`

"Could not startup" usually means that the Gtk+ could not connect to
the X server as determined by the DISPLAY environment variable. Do echo
$DISPLAY and see if you get anything. If not, you need to forward your X
connection over SSH, this is done with -X option to ssh and with
X11Forwarding in sshd_config.

Yes I do have libatk dev installed, and
/usr/include/atk-1.0/atk/atkregistry.h 

 44 struct _AtkRegistryClass
 45 {
 46   GObjectClass    parent_class;
 47 };
 48
 49 typedef struct _AtkRegistry             AtkRegistry;

[2008-03-07 19:50:29] bmajdak@php.net

So my first guess was not the problem.

./atk/atkregistry.h:49:typedef struct _AtkRegistry AtkRegistry;

Can you confirm that you have the atk dev package installed, and a
/usr/include/atk-1.0/atk/atkregistry.h containing that line above on
line 49?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-03-07 12:43:59] nhlaine at gmx dot net

libatk is 1.12.4
gen_atk.c to follow by email as req.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I was digging through the bugs and noticed the "segfault on clone" issue
&gt; was still there.  I've been thinking that we should just hook the clone
&gt; object handler and throw an exception/ fatal error - that way people
&gt; know that you can't clone gtk objects and we don't let the engine go boom.
&gt; 
&gt; Any opinions on the subject? (it'd fix the bug too ;)

We haven't done this yet? I could swear I did this.. apparently not. Should just 
just do an E_WARNING saying that cloning is not working?

Hiya Andrei,

&gt; Any ideas? The reason gtk_init() needs argc/argv is to parse out options 
&gt; like --display, etc. If we are willing to remove support for those 
&gt; options, then we can call gtk_init() with argc=0, argv=NULL and have it in 
&gt; MINIT.

Could you please clarify where '--display, etc' are used? As in, which 
scenarios?

Thanks,

- Steph

Hi Frédéric,

I had a vague memory of that - that's why I asked. It's come up on the 
mailing list a few times in the past.

Andrei: there's a use case for it in PHP-GTK, we can't just turn it off :(

These are the default X.11 arguments: --display, for instance, allows
the application to display a remote display, different from the one it
was started on.

Sample case: from a putty session, without a X display, open a PHP-GTK
app to the attached X server.

My reflection-based script seems to be working now, and it also put into 
light a three other symbol clashes in the PHP-GTK constants:

Gdk::XOR
Gdk::AND
Gdk::OR

These are also reserved PHP words. The problem with Traversable not 
being implementable in a script is really a PHP issue, not one with PHP-GTK.

Andrei Zmievski a écrit :
[...}&gt; It's not a bug, but more of a mismatch between languages. Trying to
&gt; redefine "foreach" methods is kind of useless right now, because they 
&gt; will not be called by anything, but with the upcoming virtual method 
&gt; support, they will be. So we probably should think about migrating these 
&gt; to a new name, possibly "for_each".

Elizabeth/Bob -

Thanks for the suggestion and the product.  Worked like a charm.

We need this on the resources page.... along with the debian 
installers.  Would be nice.

thanks,

&gt;&gt; I just finished setting up a Kubuntu 7.10 box, and decided I'd give this
&gt;&gt; a shot.
&gt;&gt; My Linux is pretty basic, but we're getting more requests from our
&gt;&gt; clients that were previously early WinX to go to Linux, instead of
&gt;&gt; disastros like XP and Vista.  So this seemed like a good time to tryout
&gt;&gt; the installation process.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I tried to follow the install instructions for PHP in the PHP-Gtk2
&gt;&gt; manual, but I couldn't make it past the PHP part.  Multiple errors with
&gt;&gt; gcc, automake, etc.  So I switched to Synaptic and installed PHP 5.2.3,
&gt;&gt; with the mysql extensions.  That went fine.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then I tried to run a buildconf on the file you gave, but it's a no go.
&gt;&gt; AFAICT, it's unhappy about the location for phpize.  Out of time and
&gt;&gt; patience by now, even though I know it's probably something simple, I
&gt;&gt; have to give up.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I totally realize that this is probably my lack of expertise and time. 
&gt;&gt; And eventually, I'll find the answers and update the install page.  But
&gt;&gt; it does seem that in terms of an average user trying to make it work on
&gt;&gt; an 'out of the box' distribution install, I'd say - not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Maybe we can get Ubuntu to add it to their repositories....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; FWIW,
&gt;&gt; Madeleine D.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     
&gt; I know bob had an installer working on ubuntu flavors - might want to
&gt; make something like that available for the linux newcomers.
&gt;
&gt; http://oops.opsat.net/doc/gtk/unix-installer.html (I know it works on
&gt; ubuntu - does kubuntu have the needed gtk libs?  Thought that was all
&gt; qt, kde based)

We could always add something like Gtk::init() so that we can have php-gtk
loaded in the ini without affecting cornjobs or ssh.

Determined that this is not a problem if the display mode is set to
32-bit color rather than 16-bit.  Unfortunately, some Windows software
doesn't work in 32-bit, so this is still a problem.

Couldn't the default be just plain grey?  This seems to be the default
for every other windows app.  Having a default of "psychosis inducing
graph paper" that requires developers to figure out how to install and
modify the default theme doesn't seem like a great way to win over the
windows development community.  But what do I know, I'm a Linux
developer &gt;;)

This is not a bug, that is the color of the GTK interface, if you try
to use the GTK themes your interface change

Description:
------------
Just installed PHP-GTK 1.0.0 on Windows 98.  Don't know the version of
PHP.  Downloaded the hello world script below.  Works fine, but the
default "color" is light grey, covered with dark grey dots.  Also
downloaded a longer sample program.  Again, works fine but with little
grey dots all over it.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php

if (!class_exists('gtk')) {
    if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0,3) == 'WIN'))
    dl('php_gtk.dll');
  else
    dl('php_gtk.so');
}

function delete_event()
{
    return false;
}

function shutdown()
{
    print("Shutting down...\n");
    gtk::main_quit();
}

function hello()
{
    global $window;
    print "Hello World!\n";
    $window-&gt;destroy();
}

$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'shutdown');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$window-&gt;set_border_width(10);

$button = &amp;new GtkButton('Hello World!');
$button-&gt;connect('clicked', 'hello');
$window-&gt;add($button);

$window-&gt;show_all();

gtk::main();

?&gt;


Expected result:
----------------
A little window with a button saying hello world, but without little
dark grey spots all over it.

Actual result:
--------------
Could send a screen shot,

PHP-GTK2 solves many issues with GTK on windows.  Try a PHP5 and

So my first guess was not the problem.

./atk/atkregistry.h:49:typedef struct _AtkRegistry AtkRegistry;

Can you confirm that you have the atk dev package installed, and a

line 49?

I just tried compiling PHP-GTK standalone with sourceview on a Gentoo
machine, and it seems to work fine. The ebuild, however, is broken and
will be fixed shortly.

I personally vote fatal E_ERROR saying it never will, stop people dead in their 
tracks. Whole concept seems dumb to me when I think about graphical user 
interface objects.

If I wanted duplicates of a GtkButton I would make build the class to how I want 
them to be. Not build one, mod, and clone. Does not even seem economical. But 
that is just me.

&gt;&gt; I was digging through the bugs and noticed the "segfault on clone" issue

&gt;&gt; know that you can't clone gtk objects and we don't let the engine go 
&gt;&gt; boom.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any opinions on the subject? (it'd fix the bug too ;)
&gt; 
&gt; We haven't done this yet? I could swear I did this.. apparently not. 
&gt; Should just just do an E_WARNING saying that cloning is not working?

Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.

an attempted clone operation will now produce a fatal error instead of
segfaulting - don't clone gtk objects ;)

clone operation is not supported by actual php-gtk.

Please document this in PHP-GTK documentation.

John has a point. Putting it onto the docs folk. (Sorry docs folk.)

[2007-06-29 00:27:31] john dot navratil at sbcglobal dot net

Fair enough!  I assumed as much and will look forward to object cloning
in the future.

Meanwhile, we might wish to review the docs at
"language.oop5.cloning.php" which refers to cloning GTK (not +) windows.
 It might also be a reasonable idea to implement the clone methods to
throw an Exception("Cloning not supported") in the meantime.  A
segmentation fault is a bit of a foul, don't you think?

I know it's beta software and I'm sure there is plenty to do.  Many
thanks for what has been provided to date.

a bug. Please double-check the documentation available at
http://www.php.net/manual/ and the instructions on how to report
a bug at http://bugs.php.net/how-to-report.php

Cloning is not supported in PHP-GTK yet. We\'re hoping to resolve this

soon.

&gt; Any ideas for how to handle this?

I vote for forcing users to use strings to identify groups. The old  
function that uses integers will be available anyway (even though it  
is deprecated). This also makes it easier for us.

Gah, this is what happens when sending before proofreading - usually
this is a static gpointer var = "mystring" in the code I've seen...

Description:
------------
While designing a Till system using php gtk2 and grabbing code from
several examples. I encountered the following problem.
When clicking on an item in a GtkListStore object, the callback
function is either renamed/ stored incorrectly.

Despite me renaming it several times the function name is not handled
properly and causes characters to be misinterpreted.


$sectionBasketView = GtkListStore( Gtk::TYPE_STRING, Gtk::TYPE_LONG,
Gtk::TYPE_DOUBLE);
.
.
    $selection = $sectionBasketView-&gt;get_selection();
    $selection-&gt;connect('changed', "on_selection");
.
.
function on_selection()
{
.
.



Expected result:
----------------
on_selection function execution


Actual result:
--------------
The error log shows that the 9th character is pushed up by 1 character
code.
Here is a report from the error.txt it produced.
The first instance the letter "t" being replaced with a "s" character.
The second instance "i" renamed the function call with a "j" at the
start
this in turn affected the next character "c" changing to a "b".
As far as i can tell the on_selection is not used anywhere else.
Is this an inbuilt command/event/property?

Description:
------------
Under Redhat 9 using PHP 5.1.4, gcc 3.2.2, php-gtk2.0alpha (and also
php-gtk from CVS), everything compiles and links ok but when I try to
run PHP (after having added the extension=php_gtk2.so to the php.ini I
get:

&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library
'/usr/local/php-5.1.4/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20050922/php_gtk2.so'
- /usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_hash_table_ref in
&lt;b&gt;Unknown&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Of note, I had to compile and install by hand all the components of
gtk+-2.0 .. including glib, cairo, atk, pango, gtk, etc. 

However, the test gtk apps work just fine so I have reason to believe
it's not my compilation of the libraries thats' at fault.

Installing the same php-gtk codebase under Fedora Core 4 using PHP
5.1.4 worked just fine.

This bug has been fixed in CVS.

Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.

It doesn't "fail silently" - it actually is set, gtk just doesn't
display it, it displays the url instead - nothing we can do about that.

Also we can't check for a url_hook, there's no way to do that with the
gtk api unless we do some nutty set it with a temporary callback, check
if it was null, and reset it - not the best thing to do.

It does make sense, though, to have set_website_label call set_website
if set_website is empty - that's what was changed in CVS.

The need for a url_hook to have gtk display the website_label has been
added to the documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2006-11-02 00:26:53] sfox@php.net

Not actually bogus - there should really be a check for the status of
set_url_hook() if possible, and some error message thrown if it's
missing.

I'd have assumed that the label was just that - a label - and not
necessarily a link. Another alternative would be to make it call
set_website() if there's no callback in place.

Whatever. It doesn't matter which approach we take, it shouldn't fail
silently anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2006-11-01 23:13:38] auroraeosrose@php.net

This is expected behavior.  You must use GtkAboutDialog::set_url_hook()
with a usable callback in order for the website label to be displayed. 
I've added a note to the documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2006-11-01 17:15:02] phporcaffeine at gmail dot com

Description:
------------
GKT Version: 2

PHP Version: 5.1.4 (5.1.6 was the only 5.1.x listed)

GtkAboutDialog::set_website_label() does not render any results.  It
doesn't generate any noticable errors either.

It just doesn't do anything.  Oddly enough though,
GtkAboutDialog::set_website() works just fine.

I have tried several implementations/uses of the method with no luck.
*******************************************************
$gktAboutDialog-&gt;set_website_label("text"); //NO LUCK

$gktAboutDialog-&gt;set_website_label($str); //NO LUCK

GtkAboutDialog::set_website_label() //NOT STATIC METHOD
********************************************************

As far as I can see, the manual makes no mention of depreciation or not
having been implemented yet.

Thanks for looking into it,

-Ryan

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php

//GTK CLASS CHECK
if (!class_exists("gtk")) {
	
	die("The PHP-GTK class was not detected and therefore this file cannot
continue");
}

/****************************************/

$artists = array("Artist");

$authors = array("Developer");

$title = "Application Information";

$name = "Applcation Name";

$comments = "These are the comments";  

$copyright = "Copyright " . date("Y") . "© All Rights Reserved"; 

$license = "This is the license";   

$version = "1.0.0.0";

$website = "http://www.website.com";

$websitelabel = "Web Site Text";

/**************************************/

$about = new gtkAboutDialog();

$about-&gt;set_artists($artists);

$about-&gt;set_authors($authors);

$about-&gt;set_comments($comments);

$about-&gt;set_copyright($copyright);

$about-&gt;set_license($license);

$about-&gt;set_name($name);

$about-&gt;set_version($version);

$about-&gt;set_website_label($websitelabel);

$about-&gt;set_website($website);

$about-&gt;set_title($title);

$about-&gt;connect('destroy', 'main_quit');

$about-&gt;run();

gtk::main();

?&gt;


Expected result:
----------------
I expect to see the literal of the data I provided to the
GtkAboutDialog::set_website_label() method

Actual result:
--------------
I see nothing generated from the GtkAboutDialog::set_website_label()
method.

No errors are generated (I am using E_ALL)

This is a configuration error

if you "configured the error logger to hide errors and log in to a file
on my machine"

you need to check your logs to discover why you get a "blank page" - in
this case probably apache usually doesn't have access to your X display
so when php-gtk is loaded you get a fatal error

The correct fix is to configure your machine so apache doesn't load the
PHP-GTK extension

It's not a bug that php-gtk2 only works with the php cli sapi....

Perhaps it needs to throw an error when people attempt to load it with
any other sapi "This only works with the cli version of PHP"

This is a nice work around, but this does not fix the bug that we need
to!!!

First of all, make sure you use the cli version of php (php.exe or
php-win32.exe on windows..) with php-gtk2 - it is NOT meant to be used
with a webserver or a webserver SAPI (isapi, apache2_2 module,
cgi...etc)!

If you're running both a webserver AND php-gtk on the same machine
you're going to need to use different php.ini files, your webserver ini
file should NOT be loading the php-gtk2.dll  You can do this easily by
setting the PHPINIDIR directive in your apache conf file or by renaming
your php-gtk specific ini file php-cli.ini (a little known feature on
windows is that php looks for sapi specific ini files - I have a
php.ini, a php-isapi.ini, and a php-cli.ini all in the same
directory...and IIS, apache, and the php cli always find the right file
;)

Description:
------------
First of all, sorry for my bad english!!

I use PHP5 in both server side (With Apache 2.2), and client side
(Using PHP-GTK)

After I installed the PHP-GTK v2.0 on my PHP 5.2.1, accedently the
logos of both PHP and Zend that appears on the page of "phpinfo.php" has
disappeared!!

I found that error occured when I added the "php.ini" setting:

extension=php-gtk2.dll

My error logs has repoted the following error:

[21-Feb-2007 04:18:43] PHP Fatal error:  Cannot inherit
previously-inherited constant gtype from interface GtkCellLayout in
Unknown on line 0



Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
phpinfo();
?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
I expected to see the PHP and Zend logo with this codes:

phpinfo.php?=PHPE9568F34-D428-11d2-A769-00AA001ACF42
phpinfo.php?=PHPE9568F35-D428-11d2-A769-00AA001ACF42

Actual result:
--------------
What I saw when I query the "phpinfo.php" page was a blank page (As I
configured the error logger to hide errors and log in to a file on my
machine)

 Bug Type:         PHP-GTK related
 Operating System: GNU/Linux
 PHP Version:      5.2.0
 Assigned To:      bmajdak
 New Comment:

On my side I do not experiment the 'Could not startup' error. Please
find below the full error trace.
Also I tried to rebuild from CVS and followed ur instructions bmajdak
and  it didn't change a thing. The `php -i | grep Configure` doesn't
echo anything...?

"Could not startup" usually means that the Gtk+ could not connect to
the X server as determined by the DISPLAY environment variable. Do echo
$DISPLAY and see if you get anything. If not, you need to forward your X
connection over SSH, this is done with -X option to ssh and with
X11Forwarding in sshd_config.

"Could not startup." The only time I have seen that is when doing this
over SSH and PHP-GTK is already installed. nhlaine at gmx dot net do you
also get this before it bombs?

Also as an experiment, both of you please extract a clean copy of the
source, and if you have an old version of PHP-GTK get rid of it and
comment out the reference to php_gtk.so in your PHP.INI. Also can your
SSH connections if you are doing this remotely, do it from the keyboard
with X running. If you are curious to why, check this out:

Configuring PHP and GTK
http://oops.opsat.net/doc/gtk/configure-php.html

# over ssh with php-gtk enabled.
[bob@kathryn ~]$ php
Could not startup.

Then do this on the clean source.

`./buildconf; ./configure; make`
Here you would get the error, then

`make clean-gen clean; make`
And see if that gets you through to the next round. Perhaps the
pre-generated files are mixing to do odd things.

If you still get problems, then we might be having PHP problems or some
compiler bug... recompile PHP using whatever compiler you have installed
and try again. If your PHP is currently from a package you can grab the
./configure line from PHP by asking `php -i | grep Configure`

Yes I do have libatk dev installed, and
/usr/include/atk-1.0/atk/atkregistry.h 

 44 struct _AtkRegistryClass
 45 {
 46   GObjectClass    parent_class;
 47 };
 48
 49 typedef struct _AtkRegistry             AtkRegistry;
 50 typedef struct _AtkRegistryClass        AtkRegistryClass;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-03-07 19:50:29] bmajdak@php.net

So my first guess was not the problem.

./atk/atkregistry.h:49:typedef struct _AtkRegistry AtkRegistry;

Can you confirm that you have the atk dev package installed, and a
/usr/include/atk-1.0/atk/atkregistry.h containing that line above on
line 49?

I shall try and dig out the code i tested at the time.
If not the GtkList Object is easily created from one of the demos. I
shall add the callback function and see how i get on.

Please try using this CVS snapshot:

  http://snaps.php.net/php5.2-latest.tar.gz
 
For Windows (zip):
 
  http://snaps.php.net/win32/php5.2-win32-latest.zip

For Windows (installer):

  http://snaps.php.net/win32/php5.2-win32-installer-latest.msi

Does this still occur with newer versions?

Description:
------------
While designing a Till system using php gtk2 and grabbing code from
several examples. I encountered the following problem.
When clicking on an item in a GtkListStore object, the callback
function is either renamed/ stored incorrectly.

Despite me renaming it several times the function name is not handled
properly and causes characters to be misinterpreted.


$sectionBasketView = GtkListStore( Gtk::TYPE_STRING, Gtk::TYPE_LONG,
Gtk::TYPE_DOUBLE);
.
.
    $selection = $sectionBasketView-&gt;get_selection();
    $selection-&gt;connect('changed', "on_selection");
.
.
function on_selection()
{
.
.



Expected result:
----------------
on_selection function execution


Actual result:
--------------
The error log shows that the 9th character is pushed up by 1 character
code.
Here is a report from the error.txt it produced.
The first instance the letter "t" being replaced with a "s" character.
The second instance "i" renamed the function call with a "j" at the
start
this in turn affected the next character "c" changing to a "b".
As far as i can tell the on_selection is not used anywhere else.
Is this an inbuilt command/event/property?

I ´ve the some problems with my program like mentioned by kksou some days ago.

http://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/articles/use-drag-and-drop-to-shift-rows-in-a-GtkTreeView---Part-1.php


I ´ve connected the signal "drag-data-received" for drag n DROP.

If i use the x and y variable in the callback to get the drag destination
row with $pathData = $widget-&gt;get_path_at_pos($x, $y); i got an wrong
position. Like kksou mentioned, i have to substract 1... that works... but
what, if i want to drag to the end of the list (last entry)? This isnt
working, because i substract 1 by default.

In the documentation i ´ve found no hint for this.

	$treeView-&gt;connect('drag-data-received', array($this, 'onDrop'));

	public function onDrop($widget, $context, $x, $y, $data, $info, $time){
		
		# get the destination
		$pathData = $widget-&gt;get_path_at_pos($x, $y);
		
		$path = reset($pathData[0])-1;
		if($path &lt; 1) $path = 0;

		# QUESTION - How to handle the drop on last entry?
		# i cannot access this, because i substract 1 by default!
		
		$selection-&gt;select_path($path);
		list($model, $iter) = $selection-&gt;get_selected();
		if ($iter === null) return false;
		$destCompoundId = $model-&gt;get_value($iter, 5);

		// aso......
		
	}

Best regards,
Andreas

Hi Elizabeth,

&gt; I didn't see a commit for this but I might have missed it, did the fix
&gt; for using hyphens in ini names go in?  Or do we need to bug some people ;)

Yep, it's in - it just didn't turn up in the commit mail for some reason.

I've found a way to avoid that problem. I'm using Ubuntu Gutsy and for
some reason, my personal
account has this variable set : GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge ; other
account do not have this
variable on my computer.

If I unset this variable, now, I can run nicely php cli with gtk. I
have also a problem
about this variable on kino (video editor on linux). There is a bug
report on launchpad :

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kino/+bug/188553

I think this is more a gnome/gtk problem than an Ubuntu one.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; If you activate php_gtk in "/etc/php.ini" you will be unable to use
&gt; php for cron-jobs and shellscripts over ssh even until you diable it!
&gt; 
&gt; I can not believe taht im the only person who uses php for
&gt; shellscripting :-)
&gt; 

... for windows we just dump a php-cli.ini in the same directory -
search path stuff makes this work since you'll probably use a separate
binary for cron-jobs and shell scripts on win - on nix it's a bit more
complicated

Any chance we can hack in a php-gtk.ini so we can totally avoid any issues?

Going to roll the release in a couple of hours. Anyone want to prepare 
the Win32 one?

Give me a minute to make sure I have the latest gtk libs and I'll give
it a roll-up - where shall I shove the finished win32 builds?

&gt;&gt; Builds and appears to run fine with windows (but the win build system
&gt;&gt; always regenerates source ;).  I have a build ready to go, with
&gt;&gt; gtksourceview and libglade extensions.  I also have gtkhtml building but
&gt;&gt; it needs so many dependencies I have that in a different package.  I
&gt;&gt; couldn't find prebuilt libs for the others and don't have time to build
&gt;&gt; them right now, so things like the svg pixbuf loader, libsexy, gtkextra,
&gt;&gt; scintilla, and gtkspell will have to wait until I get some libraries.
&gt;&gt; Core and the extensions that build appear to work (I don't have a good
&gt;&gt; gtkhtml test, anyone care to write one?)
&gt; 
&gt; Ok. Can you check the Windows builds into php-gtk-web/distributions?
&gt; 
&gt; -Andrei

Up it went - I included libglade and gtksourceview because their
requirements are light and they work well, gtk_html isn't up yet because
I can't get it to cooperate on windows - it'll just have to wait for
when I tackle building gtk again.

Should be unzip and run on windows - the php included is a stock build.

hello,

I'm trying to build php-gtk2 on ubuntu/gutsy (latest stable release). It works,
the build process is OK. It's based on my wiki guide :

  http://php.classes.free.fr/wiki/index.php?title=Gtk2/InstallUnix#ubuntu_Feisty__.2B_php-gtk2_beta

The problem is about Gtk support. Ubuntu Gusty is bundled with libgtk 2.12.
I suppose that's why I have a problem at script shutdown.

With "php -i" and any script trying to exit(), process never close.

You can find my build process log at this address :

 - http://php-gtk.pastebin.ca/859588 (configure)
 - http://php-gtk.pastebin.ca/859590 (make)

I have tried to not bundle extra libraries (except libglade).

Is there a way to correct this problem ?

Hi all,

I _think_ I'm there - as in, everything appears to build as expected whether 
from cache or from scratch - but I'd like some confirmation of these 
figures.

Elizabeth, do you have the coverage output from the build logs handy for 
2.10?

e.g. on my system, 2.6 build:

========================================================================
                              Gtk Coverage
========================================================================
Functions           :  91.7% written (66/72)
Methods             :  96.3% written (1851/1922)
Constructors        :  99.3% written (150/151)
Property accessors  :  97.1% written (169/174)

========================================================================
                              Gdk Coverage
========================================================================
Functions           :  87.3% written (62/71)
Methods             :  86.5% written (315/364)
Constructors        :  90.9% written (20/22)
Property accessors  :  97.5% written (79/81)


same system, 2.10 build:

========================================================================
                              Gtk Coverage
========================================================================
Functions           :  80.4% written (74/92)
Methods             :  95.9% written (2194/2288)
Constructors        :  99.4% written (170/171)
Property accessors  :  97.1% written (169/174)

========================================================================
                              Gdk Coverage
========================================================================
Functions           :  86.5% written (64/74)
Methods             :  86.0% written (325/378)
Constructors        :  90.9% written (20/22)
Property accessors  :  97.5% written (79/81)

It seems about right to me, but you threw me with that line about 'ONLY 
include those overrides/defs'.

&gt; Windows defines it as (for example) COMPILE_DL_HTML2 and nix defines it
&gt; as PHP_GTK_DL_HTML2 or something like that - I don't have time to look
&gt; it up at the moment but there was a thread on the mailing list about it.
&gt; So right now you can't compile php-gtk extensions shared on nix.

We've been here before - we had exactly the same issue in PHP-GTK 1. I'll 
try and find how we got round it when the article's written/the proofs are 
edited/the voices, the voices...

Probably isn't too late to sneak it in either ;)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This patch fixes/adds to the GtkSourceView currently non-generated 
&gt;&gt; functions. It
&gt;&gt; allows for the use of the special search feature allowing case 
&gt;&gt; insensitive
&gt;&gt; searching (a built in part of GtkSourceView)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I spent a lot of time on this, ended up rewriting some of the defintions. 
&gt;&gt; GtkSourceView has a fake type GtkSourceIter, which is /just/ a 
&gt;&gt; GtkTextIter, and in fact GtkSourceIter is not even in the GtkSourceView 
&gt;&gt; code as a type, just the documentation. However, it does have 
&gt;&gt; gtk_source_iter_forward_search() which when bound to a GBoxed of 
&gt;&gt; GtkSourceIter breaks *all* GtkTextIter methods. My solution to this was 
&gt;&gt; to drop _forward_search() and _backward_search() on the main 
&gt;&gt; GtkSourceView class, in addition to some new flags.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Screenshot:
&gt;&gt;     http://www.opsat.net/temp/sourceview-search.jpg
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Example Code:
&gt;&gt;     http://p.opsat.net/v/172/54
&gt;&gt;     (not the best for example)
&gt;&gt;     (it is a copy paste from the project I am working on but eh)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Added Methods:
&gt;&gt;     array/bool GtkSourceView::forward_search(
&gt;&gt;         GtkTreeIter start, string text,
&gt;&gt;         int flags[, GtkTreeIter stop]
&gt;&gt;     );
&gt;&gt;     array/bool GtkSourceView::backward_search(
&gt;&gt;         GtkTreeIter start, string text,
&gt;&gt;         int flags[, GtkTreeIter stop]
&gt;&gt;     );
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Both return array(GtkTreeIter, GtkTreeIter), the start/stop of the 
&gt;&gt; match when a match is found, and Boolean false when no match was found.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Added Flags:
&gt;&gt;     GtkSourceView::SEARCH_VISIBLE_ONLY
&gt;&gt;     GtkSourceView::SEARCH_TEXT_ONLY
&gt;&gt;     GtkSourceView::SEARCH_CASE_INSENSITIVE
&gt;&gt;

for your information, I have an other computer with ubuntu/gutsy, and
there is not
problem at exit(). So this is probably a problem for my computer only.

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] INI problem


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I went to fix the shared build issue on *nix and discovered we can't load 
&gt; PHP-GTK extensions in 5.3.0 even under Windows. Hyphens are illegal syntax 
&gt; in INI directives now. (I know this because an old 5.3-dev told me so - 
&gt; the current message is rather less helpful, it just says 'parse error'.)
&gt;
&gt; Renaming our INI directives to use underscores doesn't work because the 
&gt; prefix needs to match the extension name...
&gt;
&gt; Jani, can you assist?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; - Steph

... and having looked at them despite my better intentions, they're all 
PHP_5_3 specials that throw a warning for ZVAL_* macros and there's nothing 
we can do about them. Exception:

main\phpg_gobject.c(127) : warning C4133: 'function' : incompatible types - 
from 'struct _store_object *' to 'struct _zval_struct *'

but I don't see a way around that one either. Any takers, Andrei?

Good grief - I'm away for a few days and everything blows up.

First of all, the generator should be automatically detecting the gtk
library version you're building against and ONLY include those
overrides/defs. That's what the numbers after the include statements are
for (include "blah.def" "2.10") If you're building against 2.6 and
getting the 2.10 overrides included in your generated files (after
deleting the def caches) then there is an issue with the generator
system.  I know at one point someone had taken out the strings around
the "2.10" in the override file which borked things (php will juggle
that to 2.1 instead of 2.10 which makes version_compare not work as
expected)

I thought I put BACK all those quotes but I might have missed some.

Now, if you're building against the 2.6 gtk libs and the 2.10 defs and
libs ARE being included - we have an issue.  Look at the configure and
make sure your library version is being detected correctly and make sure
you're using at least 5.2.x as the php binary to do the generation (I
know earlier version of php had issues)  I've managed to build cvs
against 2.6, 2.8, 2.10 and 2.12 libs successfully on Windows Steph, so
I'd venture to say that something is rotten in the state of Denmark if
you're getting the wrong defs included.  Maybe the detection in the
windows build system is borked.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Probably too late to sneak this in to 2.0.0.

This patch fixes/adds to the GtkSourceView currently non-generated functions. It
allows for the use of the special search feature allowing case insensitive
searching (a built in part of GtkSourceView)

I spent a lot of time on this, ended up rewriting some of the defintions. 
GtkSourceView has a fake type GtkSourceIter, which is /just/ a GtkTextIter, and 
in fact GtkSourceIter is not even in the GtkSourceView code as a type, just the 
documentation. However, it does have gtk_source_iter_forward_search() which when 
bound to a GBoxed of GtkSourceIter breaks *all* GtkTextIter methods. My solution 
to this was to drop _forward_search() and _backward_search() on the main 
GtkSourceView class, in addition to some new flags.

Screenshot:
	http://www.opsat.net/temp/sourceview-search.jpg

Example Code:
	http://p.opsat.net/v/172/54
	(not the best for example)
	(it is a copy paste from the project I am working on but eh)

Added Methods:
	array/bool GtkSourceView::forward_search(
		GtkTreeIter start, string text,
		int flags[, GtkTreeIter stop]
	);
	array/bool GtkSourceView::backward_search(
		GtkTreeIter start, string text,
		int flags[, GtkTreeIter stop]
	);

	Both return array(GtkTreeIter, GtkTreeIter), the start/stop of the match when a 
match is found, and Boolean false when no match was found.

Added Flags:
	GtkSourceView::SEARCH_VISIBLE_ONLY
	GtkSourceView::SEARCH_TEXT_ONLY
	GtkSourceView::SEARCH_CASE_INSENSITIVE

Andrei, Elizabeth, all -

In the gtk_curve_set_vector() override, the line:

vectors[i] = Z_LVAL_PP(data);

throws a compiler warning under MSVC 6. I changed it to:

vectors[i] = Z_DVAL_PP(data);

since the data points to a double, not a long. Fixing this doesn't actually 
clear the warning, thanks to a bug in the VC6 compiler, so I just wanted to 
highlight that change in case it causes any trouble.

The other thing relates to the 'hack' to load GD under Windows. There were a 
couple of compiler warnings I killed in there, but I've no idea how to test 
the functionality. Can you please either mail me a test script or test it 
for yourself fresh out of CVS? Note: I moved DL_FETCH_SYMBOL to 
GetProcAddress for clarity in the win32-only section, they're one and the 
same thing to Zend except that GetProcAddress is rather better documented ;)

Just two compiler warnings left - one (GtkEntry::get_inner_border() in GTK 
2.10 and up) will probably need an override if we really want to return a 
GtkBorder struct as a constant (??? defs-munging might be nicer), the other 
is the DVAL one mentioned earlier.

Assuming I didn't actually break anything, that's me done for pre-release 
stuff. I'd still like to do things with the Windows build system, but that 
won't affect anything else.

Some testing would be good at this stage...

This is an updated patch to one I posted awhile ago, addressing all the issues 
Andrei had with it. Works great now.

 &gt; Please don't use _marshal suffix for helper function like these.
	Fixed.
 &gt; While this works, it's not how the objects should be constructed.
	Fixed.
 &gt; Do we need to duplicate the strings when adding them to the list?
	No. Fixed.

Screenshot:

Code for screenshot:
	http://p.opsat.net/v/174/35

Adds two two new methods:
	GtkScaleButton::__construct(
		GtkIconSize size, float min, float max,
		float step[, array iconlist]
	);

	GtkScaleButton::set_icons(array iconlist);

Enabling classes:
	GtkScaleButton
	GtkVolumeButton

I tested it with GtkSourceView only and it worked. Built, installed, and ran it 
fine. However it still has the "wrong" filename, it ends up as sourceview.so 
instead of php_gtk2_sourceview.so.

OK, that needs a *nix build merchant - if you agree that it's a bug.

I would've expected it to be sourceview.so from the code, but I don't know 
if that's wrong or not. And I don't have any way to check it out anyways.

Thanks for testing Bob, thousands don't.

I consider it a bug in that, what if for example there was a /real/ PHP 
extension called Sexy? PHP-GTK would overwrite it with it's own libsexy 
extension. I've talked about this before with Elizabeth and Anant and I think we 
were in agreement that that should be fixed. I think at the time though none of 
us really had a clue about what exactly needs the tweak, nor time to investigate 
it. Really it should be the same as the Windows DLL's with the prefix, IMHO.

I can't seem to build a shared extension at all. I could look at the  
renaming issue once I've figured that out.

All I had done was:

	./buildconf
	./configure --with-sourceview=shared
	make &amp;&amp; make install

And it was magically there.

The Windows ones are php_gtk_sexy2.dll.

If you want to change the naming of the .so ones to match that you'll 
probably need to fiddle with a single line in php_gtk.m4 - with Andrei's 
agreement of course.

Let me know if it turns out to affect all (e.g. if there needs to be a 2 at 
the end of the constant in the sources) because that will require a minor 
change at the doze end too.

Thanks,

- Steph

Subject: Re: [PHP-GTK-DEV] Re: nix shared ext


&gt;I consider it a bug in that, what if for example there was a /real/ PHP 
&gt;extension called Sexy? PHP-GTK would overwrite it with it's own libsexy 
&gt;extension. I've talked about this before with Elizabeth and Anant and I 
&gt;think we were in agreement that that should be fixed. I think at the time 
&gt;though none of us really had a clue about what exactly needs the tweak, nor 
&gt;time to investigate it. Really it should be the same as the Windows DLL's 
&gt;with the prefix, IMHO.

&gt;&gt; I would've expected it to be sourceview.so from the code, but I don't 
&gt;&gt; know if that's wrong or not. And I don't have any way to check it out 
&gt;&gt; anyways.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for testing Bob, thousands don't.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I tested it with GtkSourceView only and it worked. Built, installed, and 
&gt;&gt;&gt; ran it fine. However it still has the "wrong" filename, it ends up as 
&gt;&gt;&gt; sourceview.so instead of php_gtk2_sourceview.so.

We shouldn't use C99's syntax, since not all compilers support it. I'm 
talking about initializing an array from a non-const value.

Using only GCC I would never notice (or care really :z). How do these other 
compilers feel about basic pointer arithmetic?

list = g_malloc0(sizeof(gchar *) * (listlen + 2));
//. space for not overwriting the head pointer and leaving a null on
//. the tail end.

... and moving to 5_3 to fill in Jani's bug report, I'm now seeing warnings 
that aren't there with 5_2 &lt;sigh /&gt;

I'll go through them tomorrow.

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] Compiler warnings and etc


&gt; Andrei, Elizabeth, all -
&gt;
&gt; In the gtk_curve_set_vector() override, the line:
&gt;
&gt; vectors[i] = Z_LVAL_PP(data);
&gt;
&gt; throws a compiler warning under MSVC 6. I changed it to:
&gt;
&gt; vectors[i] = Z_DVAL_PP(data);
&gt;
&gt; since the data points to a double, not a long. Fixing this doesn't 
&gt; actually clear the warning, thanks to a bug in the VC6 compiler, so I just 
&gt; wanted to highlight that change in case it causes any trouble.
&gt;
&gt; The other thing relates to the 'hack' to load GD under Windows. There were 
&gt; a couple of compiler warnings I killed in there, but I've no idea how to 
&gt; test the functionality. Can you please either mail me a test script or 
&gt; test it for yourself fresh out of CVS? Note: I moved DL_FETCH_SYMBOL to 
&gt; GetProcAddress for clarity in the win32-only section, they're one and the 
&gt; same thing to Zend except that GetProcAddress is rather better documented 
&gt; ;)
&gt;
&gt; Just two compiler warnings left - one (GtkEntry::get_inner_border() in GTK 
&gt; 2.10 and up) will probably need an override if we really want to return a 
&gt; GtkBorder struct as a constant (??? defs-munging might be nicer), the 
&gt; other is the DVAL one mentioned earlier.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming I didn't actually break anything, that's me done for pre-release 
&gt; stuff. I'd still like to do things with the Windows build system, but that 
&gt; won't affect anything else.
&gt;
&gt; Some testing would be good at this stage...
&gt;

Looks good.

&gt; Probably too late to sneak this in to 2.0.0.

&gt; This patch fixes/adds to the GtkSourceView currently non-generated 
&gt; functions. It
&gt; allows for the use of the special search feature allowing case insensitive
&gt; searching (a built in part of GtkSourceView)
&gt; 
&gt; I spent a lot of time on this, ended up rewriting some of the 
&gt; defintions. GtkSourceView has a fake type GtkSourceIter, which is /just/ 
&gt; a GtkTextIter, and in fact GtkSourceIter is not even in the 
&gt; GtkSourceView code as a type, just the documentation. However, it does 
&gt; have gtk_source_iter_forward_search() which when bound to a GBoxed of 
&gt; GtkSourceIter breaks *all* GtkTextIter methods. My solution to this was 
&gt; to drop _forward_search() and _backward_search() on the main 
&gt; GtkSourceView class, in addition to some new flags.

Morning Elizabeth!


&gt; Good grief - I'm away for a few days and everything blows up.
&gt;
&gt; First of all, the generator should be automatically detecting the gtk
&gt; library version you're building against and ONLY include those
&gt; overrides/defs. That's what the numbers after the include statements are
&gt; for (include "blah.def" "2.10") If you're building against 2.6 and
&gt; getting the 2.10 overrides included in your generated files (after
&gt; deleting the def caches) then there is an issue with the generator
&gt; system.  I know at one point someone had taken out the strings around
&gt; the "2.10" in the override file which borked things (php will juggle
&gt; that to 2.1 instead of 2.10 which makes version_compare not work as
&gt; expected)

Yes, so I found.

&gt; I thought I put BACK all those quotes but I might have missed some.

I'm just making it so it doesn't need to rely on quotes. It works with the 
filenames instead, which is a tad sturdier. Overrides are working nicely 
here, I'm just sorting out defs then will throw it into cvs for other 
people/systems to test.

&gt; Now, if you're building against the 2.6 gtk libs and the 2.10 defs and
&gt; libs ARE being included - we have an issue.  Look at the configure and
&gt; make sure your library version is being detected correctly and make sure
&gt; you're using at least 5.2.x as the php binary to do the generation (I
&gt; know earlier version of php had issues)  I've managed to build cvs
&gt; against 2.6, 2.8, 2.10 and 2.12 libs successfully on Windows Steph, so
&gt; I'd venture to say that something is rotten in the state of Denmark if
&gt; you're getting the wrong defs included.  Maybe the detection in the
&gt; windows build system is borked.

Nope, the detection's working just fine.

- Steph

&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Elizabeth

I would have /liked/ to have had GtkScaleButton done - however I also am
suffering the new-job-workload-hey-bob-do-this drama. The current patch for it
worked - but as andrei pointed out /maybe not/ the best way (though last i tried
the only way that actually worked right).

There was also a patch that fixed some TRMLSness compiling on Linux, but as
Elizabeth knows that stuff makes me swear outloud so I didn't commit it as
*nobody* commented on it.

Can you point me to that TSRM patch again?

I think we can omit GtkScaleButton until 2.0.1 or something. We can't 
expect to have complete coverage for the release and actually having a 
release will be a big boon for our users.

    Yes, please! I've been following the list for quite some time (since
months before the first Zeta Release). I check out from SVN and compile
every so often and so far have no huge issues. I'd like to see a bit more
documentation for GtkMozEmbed... I've considered signing up to help with
documentation, but I work full time, do web development as an aside and I
code for fun... I managed to get a few of the things for GtkMozEmbed that I
needed to work via PyGtk Docs, the rest I have left on my todo list (that
consists of sticky notes on  the edges of my monitor.)

    On behalf (I know I don't have any real right to say this) of all of the
PHP-GTK2 users: Please make a release!

Maybe. It's just one of the more useful things in Gtk 2.12 and without it I just 
imagine some over-the-top-dork saying PHP-GTK is useless without as much 2.12 as 
possible. (which is in a way true imho)

Follows the TSRML thing.

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] patch: compiling errors from tsrmls
Date: Fri, 23 Nov 2007 22:21:46 -0500
From: Bob Majdak Jr &lt;bob@kateos.org&gt;
Organization: KateOS
To: PHP-GTK Developers &lt;php-gtk-dev@lists.php.net&gt;

Maxdamantus from IRC was compiling CVS and receiving errors which I was able to
recognize as forgotten TSRMLS stuff and resolve. Here are two patches which
cause PHP-GTK to compile clean both on my system without thread saftey, and on
his with it. If these are O.K. with you guys then I can commit them.

Also, Any problems anyone reported with losing buffer on I/O watch, that was
fixed by making his script right... required no work to PHP-GTK ;)

Great. We should mention major features/updates as well as some

the future.

Hey Anant, long time...

Suggestions:

1) Kill the exclamation mark
2) GTK+ not Gtk+, and link to it
3) Is there support for 2.12? Last time I looked it only went up to 2.10, 
but admittedly it's been a while since I looked so that might just be me.
4) s/versions 2.8 upwards/more recent versions than 2.8
5) 'discuss issues related to the release at the development mailing 
list'.... ?!

- Steph

ps Andrei I'll have free time tomorrow.

I'll be linking to GTK+, the documentation, Scott's book, the bug  
tracker and mailing list.

Are we ready to tag and release yet? I know we're all set on the *nix  
end...

&gt; I'm just waiting on the 'dows folks. As soon as they confirm all is  well, 
&gt; I'll tag and release.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too specific about how long it was in development..  makes 
&gt;&gt;&gt; us look slow. :) Could just say "after a long development  and QA 
&gt;&gt;&gt; cycle".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Revised announcement:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt; After a long development and QA cycle, we are proud to release  version 
&gt;&gt; 2.0 of PHP-GTK. This release marks PHP-GTK 2 as stable and  comes with 
&gt;&gt; support for GTK+ versions 2.6 through 2.12. Although  support for more 
&gt;&gt; recent versions than 2.8 is not 100% complete, we  hope to cover as much 
&gt;&gt; of the API as possible in upcoming releases.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This release comes with support for custom GTypes and Signals, more  API 
&gt;&gt; coverage, and the usual slew of bug fixes. Take a look at the  Changelog 
&gt;&gt; for detailed information on changes since the beta.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you're looking to learn PHP-GTK, the documentation is a great  place 
&gt;&gt; to start. There's also an excellent book from Apress by Scott  Mattocks 
&gt;&gt; on the topic. We hope you will enjoy developing  applications with 
&gt;&gt; PHP-GTK 2. Please don't hesitate to file bug  reports at the bug tracker, 
&gt;&gt; or give us feedback on the php-gtk- general mailing list. Have fun!
&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'll be linking to GTK+, the documentation, Scott's book, the bug 
&gt;&gt; tracker and mailing list.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are we ready to tag and release yet? I know we're all set on the  *nix 
&gt;&gt; end...
&gt;&gt;

This shouldn't be going just to me.. we have a mailing list for a  
purpose.

&gt; Got it. The includes are the wrong way around (sorry, I didn't know

&gt;
&gt; Basically gtk.overrides is including gtk-2.8.overrides,  
&gt; gtk-2.10.overrides and gtk-2.12.overrides, rather than the later  
&gt; ones including their predecessors. I think it's _supposed_ to skip  
&gt; earlier versions via the generator, but it isn't working. It'd be  
&gt; more robust to have say gtk-2.12.overrides include gtk.overrides et  
&gt; al at the top. I have 2.6, 2.8 and 2.10 on board so can test, but  
&gt; it's nearly 3am @ present...

&gt;&gt;&gt; The original issue turned out to be caused by Edin's still  
&gt;&gt;&gt; shipping GTK 1.3 headers as part of the PHP Windows dev  
&gt;&gt;&gt; environment. Sorted that. This is what I'm seeing with GTK  
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.6.10... about to investigate. We've some problems with the  
&gt;&gt;&gt; enabling-all configure because a lot of the extensions are set up  
&gt;&gt;&gt; oddly and configure will error out if extension files (e.g.  
&gt;&gt;&gt; gtkextra.h) aren't available - it should really just give a  
&gt;&gt;&gt; warning. Also some things are 'enable' that probably shouldn't  
&gt;&gt;&gt; be, e.g.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; --enable-object-out-dir   Alternative location for binary objects  
&gt;&gt;&gt; during build
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I just fixed the rather confusing '--disable-zts Enable thread  
&gt;&gt;&gt; safety'. Now I've hit problems with ATK:

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Except really they're in arg_types.php. This-all is caused  
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I'm the only person in the world who always has E_STRICT on:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Strict Standards: Declaration of String_Arg::write_param() should  
&gt;&gt;&gt; be compatible with that of Arg_Type::write_param() in C:\sandbox 
&gt;&gt;&gt; \php-gtk\generator\arg_types.php on line 212
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So now I have to figure which copy of PHP I'm actually using to  
&gt;&gt;&gt; run scripts with and switch E_STRICT off, or fix the issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same error  there. So I can't blame Elizabeth :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too specific about how long it was in   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development.. makes us look slow. :) Could just say "after  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a  long development and QA cycle".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Revised announcement:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After a long development and QA cycle, we are proud to  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; release version 2.0 of PHP-GTK. This release marks PHP-GTK 2  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as stable  and comes with support for GTK+ versions 2.6  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through 2.12.  Although support for more recent versions  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 2.8 is not 100%  complete, we hope to cover as much of  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the API as possible in  upcoming releases.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This release comes with support for custom GTypes and  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Signals,  more API coverage, and the usual slew of bug  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fixes. Take a look  at the Changelog for detailed  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information on changes since the  beta.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're looking to learn PHP-GTK, the documentation is a   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; great place to start. There's also an excellent book from   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Apress by Scott Mattocks on the topic. We hope you will  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enjoy  developing applications with PHP-GTK 2. Please don't  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hesitate  to file bug reports at the bug tracker, or give us  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feedback on  the php-gtk- general mailing list. Have fun!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll be linking to GTK+, the documentation, Scott's book,  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the  bug tracker and mailing list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are we ready to tag and release yet? I know we're all set  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on  the *nix end...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anant

Let's try this again. What's stopping us from making the release? The 
beta has been out for a while and I don't think it makes sense to delay 
everything until we have some cool features like custom cell renderers 
ready.

Right now the thing that's stopping the release is time - I don't have
the time to do it at the moment (with starting a new job)

If someone else wants to handle it, go for it.

I haven't been following PHP-GTK development closely enough in some time to 
do justice to a release announcement (the doze build system's a different 
thing altogether). If someone wants me to proofread it etc though just mail 
me.

Findings:

1. Versioning's 99% of the way there but doesn't work with older versions. 
I.e. my 2.6 build, although correctly identified as such, tries to include 
2.10 features for some still-unknown reason and so fails. We should probably 
simply have later versions include older overrides from the start, rather 
than do fancy footwork to make the older version skip over them, no? Does 
anyone know a good reason not to do it that way?
2. We need to get Edin to kill the GTK+ 1.3 headers in his zip.zip (win32 
build environment). That had me going for a bit :\
3. Little bits and pieces need tidying up, e.g. if I configure --all and a 
header for a lowly extension happens to be missing the entire build aborts. 
This was less of a problem when we only had one extension than it is 
now. --all should probably force the build and give just a warning at that 
point, so long as php-gtk itself is built. There are also a lot of compiler 
warnings here... I know the ZVAL_ZVAL definition in the Zend Engine throws 
some we can't get around, but it'd be nice to get this a bit cleaner. 
That's, erm, when it will build here :)

Will spend some time on it tomorrow.

&gt;&gt; well, I'll tag and release.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too specific about how long it was in development.. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes us look slow. :) Could just say "after a long development  and QA 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cycle".
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Revised announcement:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt; After a long development and QA cycle, we are proud to release  version 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.0 of PHP-GTK. This release marks PHP-GTK 2 as stable and  comes with 
&gt;&gt;&gt; support for GTK+ versions 2.6 through 2.12. Although  support for more 
&gt;&gt;&gt; recent versions than 2.8 is not 100% complete, we  hope to cover as much 
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the API as possible in upcoming releases.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This release comes with support for custom GTypes and Signals, more  API 
&gt;&gt;&gt; coverage, and the usual slew of bug fixes. Take a look at the  Changelog 
&gt;&gt;&gt; for detailed information on changes since the beta.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're looking to learn PHP-GTK, the documentation is a great  place 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to start. There's also an excellent book from Apress by Scott  Mattocks 
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the topic. We hope you will enjoy developing  applications with 
&gt;&gt;&gt; PHP-GTK 2. Please don't hesitate to file bug  reports at the bug 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tracker, or give us feedback on the php-gtk- general mailing list. Have 
&gt;&gt;&gt; fun!
&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll be linking to GTK+, the documentation, Scott's book, the bug 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tracker and mailing list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are we ready to tag and release yet? I know we're all set on the  *nix 
&gt;&gt;&gt; end...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anant

&gt;&gt; Got it. The includes are the wrong way around (sorry, I didn't know  
&gt;&gt; how the versioning system worked at all so had to go from scratch).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Basically gtk.overrides is including gtk-2.8.overrides,  
&gt;&gt; gtk-2.10.overrides and gtk-2.12.overrides, rather than the later  
&gt;&gt; ones including their predecessors. I think it's _supposed_ to skip  
&gt;&gt; earlier versions via the generator, but it isn't working. It'd be  
&gt;&gt; more robust to have say gtk-2.12.overrides include gtk.overrides et  
&gt;&gt; al at the top. I have 2.6, 2.8 and 2.10 on board so can test, but  
&gt;&gt; it's nearly 3am @ present...

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The original issue turned out to be caused by Edin's still  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shipping GTK 1.3 headers as part of the PHP Windows dev  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment. Sorted that. This is what I'm seeing with GTK  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.6.10... about to investigate. We've some problems with the  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enabling-all configure because a lot of the extensions are set up  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oddly and configure will error out if extension files (e.g.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gtkextra.h) aren't available - it should really just give a  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; warning. Also some things are 'enable' that probably shouldn't  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be, e.g.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --enable-object-out-dir   Alternative location for binary objects  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during build
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just fixed the rather confusing '--disable-zts Enable thread  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; safety'. Now I've hit problems with ATK:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Except really they're in arg_types.php. This-all is caused  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because I'm the only person in the world who always has E_STRICT on:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Strict Standards: Declaration of String_Arg::write_param() should  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be compatible with that of Arg_Type::write_param() in C:\sandbox 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \php-gtk\generator\arg_types.php on line 212
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So now I have to figure which copy of PHP I'm actually using to  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run scripts with and switch E_STRICT off, or fix the issue.

Oh, I forgot 4. - the generator won't work if E_STRICT is enabled. That was 
another interesting one, right up until I opened gen_atk.c to take a look.

And ps obviously the 2.6 build works fine if all those includes for later 
versions are removed from the base .defs and .overrides files.

&gt; Findings:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Versioning's 99% of the way there but doesn't work with older versions. 
&gt; I.e. my 2.6 build, although correctly identified as such, tries to include 
&gt; 2.10 features for some still-unknown reason and so fails. We should 
&gt; probably simply have later versions include older overrides from the 
&gt; start, rather than do fancy footwork to make the older version skip over 
&gt; them, no? Does anyone know a good reason not to do it that way?
&gt; 2. We need to get Edin to kill the GTK+ 1.3 headers in his zip.zip (win32 
&gt; build environment). That had me going for a bit :\
&gt; 3. Little bits and pieces need tidying up, e.g. if I configure --all and a 
&gt; header for a lowly extension happens to be missing the entire build 
&gt; aborts. This was less of a problem when we only had one extension than it 
&gt; is now. --all should probably force the build and give just a warning at 
&gt; that point, so long as php-gtk itself is built. There are also a lot of 
&gt; compiler warnings here... I know the ZVAL_ZVAL definition in the Zend 
&gt; Engine throws some we can't get around, but it'd be nice to get this a bit 
&gt; cleaner. That's, erm, when it will build here :)
&gt;
&gt; Will spend some time on it tomorrow.

This might be a silly question... but if I recall right the last build Elizabeth 
did was Unzip and go all self contained on Windows, did not interact with the 
system GTK... so... why not just /give/ them Gtk 2.12. Then everyone will be 
using a PHP-GTK2 with max features for max lawlz without borking the system.

Or does this go back to the whole "but it won't work on windows 95!" thing? If 
that is the case there is probably a good reason for that.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Findings:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Versioning's 99% of the way there but doesn't work with older 
&gt;&gt; versions. I.e. my 2.6 build, although correctly identified as such, 
&gt;&gt; tries to include 2.10 features for some still-unknown reason and so 
&gt;&gt; fails. We should probably simply have later versions include older 
&gt;&gt; overrides from the start, rather than do fancy footwork to make the 
&gt;&gt; older version skip over them, no? Does anyone know a good reason not 
&gt;&gt; to do it that way?
&gt;&gt; 2. We need to get Edin to kill the GTK+ 1.3 headers in his zip.zip 
&gt;&gt; (win32 build environment). That had me going for a bit :\
&gt;&gt; 3. Little bits and pieces need tidying up, e.g. if I configure --all 
&gt;&gt; and a header for a lowly extension happens to be missing the entire 
&gt;&gt; build aborts. This was less of a problem when we only had one 
&gt;&gt; extension than it is now. --all should probably force the build and 
&gt;&gt; give just a warning at that point, so long as php-gtk itself is built. 
&gt;&gt; There are also a lot of compiler warnings here... I know the ZVAL_ZVAL 
&gt;&gt; definition in the Zend Engine throws some we can't get around, but 
&gt;&gt; it'd be nice to get this a bit cleaner. That's, erm, when it will 
&gt;&gt; build here :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Will spend some time on it tomorrow.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too specific about how long it was in development.. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes us look slow. :) Could just say "after a long development  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and QA cycle".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Revised announcement:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After a long development and QA cycle, we are proud to release  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; version 2.0 of PHP-GTK. This release marks PHP-GTK 2 as stable and  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes with support for GTK+ versions 2.6 through 2.12. Although  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support for more recent versions than 2.8 is not 100% complete, we  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope to cover as much of the API as possible in upcoming releases.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This release comes with support for custom GTypes and Signals, more 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; API coverage, and the usual slew of bug fixes. Take a look at the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Changelog for detailed information on changes since the beta.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're looking to learn PHP-GTK, the documentation is a great  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place to start. There's also an excellent book from Apress by 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Scott  Mattocks on the topic. We hope you will enjoy developing  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applications with PHP-GTK 2. Please don't hesitate to file bug  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reports at the bug tracker, or give us feedback on the php-gtk- 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; general mailing list. Have fun!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll be linking to GTK+, the documentation, Scott's book, the bug 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tracker and mailing list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are we ready to tag and release yet? I know we're all set on the  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *nix end...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,

Giving them GTK 2.12 would be a bad move as not even 10% of the new

I think you mean beyond 2.10. We've already given out 2.10 for previous 
versions. Backtracking now would be *bad*.

If it was my choice I would give them 2.12 and a list of what works. It is not 
like giving them 2.12 disables a bunch of 2.8 functions. It just adds to what 
they might want to use. More is always better.

Yeah that makes the project look incomplete but that is because /it is/ 
incomplete. I probably would have called the alpha 2.0.0, beta 2.0.1, and this 
2.0.2.

At this rate it will never be 100% as GTK grows at a rate faster than PHP-GTK 
does, and calling a 2.0.0 with 2 year old GTK version makes you feel like that 
day you were chatting with a beautiful woman online just to find out she was a 
balding 45 year old man (...).

My third suggestion would be to call this PHP-GTK2-2.0.0(delta|gamma|whatever) 
instead. The 'alpha' was never a 'real' 'alpha' and the 'beta' was never really 
a 'real' 'beta' anyway. And then just continue on with that trend still PHP6 *i 
make giggle*

Also in the Unix world, all new systems worth their effort come with the latest 
software (even Solaris with Blastwave :o !), so we'll just be causing a divide 
in operating systems. I took the 2.6 precompiled Unix versions down off my site, 
and 2.8 is coming down soon too.

It's not just that - it's more that if we're saying it works with GTK 2.6 up 
it should work for _everybody_ with GTK 2.6. up. There's a free compiler 
available for Windows now, so we're seeing more and more doze users picking 
up the cudgels these days.

Does anybody know where all that generator code for Drawable_Arg is used? 
I'm having trouble tracking it down, but it could be 'cos I'm still mucking 
about with 2.6 here. Do later GTKs use it? (NB - I can't see where it's 
called from elsewhere in the generator either - and it makes no difference 
to the gen files, which is a bit of a clue.) It's mostly that that's 
breaking E_STRICT compatibility.

So you're using PHP 6.0? ;)

It doesn't work. We tried that with zeta, but version_compare() never heard 
of zeta so we had to backtrack.

&gt; Also in the Unix world, all new systems worth their effort come with the 
&gt; latest software (even Solaris with Blastwave :o !), so we'll just be 
&gt; causing a divide in operating systems. I took the 2.6 precompiled Unix 
&gt; versions down off my site, and 2.8 is coming down soon too.

Don't confuse 'supports' with 'the supplied binary is rolled with'. We'll 
probably roll with 2.10 or 2.12, certainly not with anything earlier, but we 
_support_ from 2.6 up, which is why I'm testing it in the first place. Or 
are you suggesting we deliberately switch off GTK 2.6, thereby taking a 
completely different approach to GTK itself?

Hm, I think Bob's focusing on Windows here, which _was_ purely 2.10.

What's with the differently-labelled src tarballs? Or was that prior to

Though Microsoft quit supporting W95 not sure why anyone else should bother.

Oh, indeed - My mistake. I thought we had a 2.8 tarball for Windows  
too. I guess that means we can't go below 2.10 then.

&gt; What's with the differently-labelled src tarballs? Or was that prior  
&gt; to versioning?

That was to hide a bug from the users - the 2.10 includes would not  
allow the 2.8 version to compile. The 2.8 source tarball had the 2.10  
includes manually commented out before release. The bug has been fixed  
now, though.

The idea is that if it's rolled with 2.12 it will automatically build with

defs.

&gt; then everything I said is mostly valid since none of the 2.12 features we

I think I just killed your argument...

&gt; Though Microsoft quit supporting W95 not sure why anyone else should

I'm not even going to join in on that one. I spent time last month 
struggling with ICU, which doesn't support MSVC 6 'because it's old'. We 
have to use MSVC 6 for PHP because Apache uses MSVC 6, you'd have a choice 
of CLI or CGI otherwise. They do so because it still is the only runtime 
that works everywhere... changes upcoming in the next years tho'.

theoretically made shared extensions possible on *nix. So far we've had two 
*nix responses, one saying ay and one saying nay. Could do with a few more 
'ay's in there and an investigation into the 'nay', since all I really did 
was make it like it used to be.

I'd rather Elizabeth did the actual rolling thing for doze, I screwed up 
last time because I've so many copies of various non-MS elements floating 
around on my system. Assuming you have time, Elizabeth?

- Steph

Well there's the problem - but it'll take a *nix person to figure that one 
out because it's a completely different build system. For example, are those 
generated files deleted automatically under the *nix build system when a 
PHP-GTK build is complete?

&gt;
&gt; Well there's the problem - but it'll take a *nix person to figure that one 
&gt; out because it's a completely different build system. For example, are 
&gt; those generated files deleted automatically under the *nix build system 
&gt; when a PHP-GTK build is complete?

&gt; ps Thanks for testing!

&gt;&gt; Well there's the problem - but it'll take a *nix person to figure that 
&gt;&gt; one out because it's a completely different build system. For example, 
&gt;&gt; are those generated files deleted automatically under the *nix build 
&gt;&gt; system when a PHP-GTK build is complete?
&gt;&gt;

No, but you did a lot of work on libglade. Is that building as shared for 
you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well there's the problem - but it'll take a *nix person to figure that 
&gt;&gt;&gt; one out because it's a completely different build system. For example, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; are those generated files deleted automatically under the *nix build 
&gt;&gt;&gt; system when a PHP-GTK build is complete?
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; ps Thanks for testing!

&gt; Well there's the problem - but it'll take a *nix person to figure  
&gt; that one out because it's a completely different build system. For  
&gt; example, are those generated files deleted automatically under the  
&gt; *nix build system when a PHP-GTK build is complete?

Ok, looks like I get the same error on a fresh checkout. It's trying  
to build sourceview *before* gtk+, which is why the gen_* files aren't  
there yet.

I thought we fixed the ordering issue sometime back - oddly this crops  
up only when we use the =shared option.

As for libglade, it builds, but no .so is generated anywhere (still  
static) :-)

Tag it so I can get the same source for the windows build and I'll do
one with the 2.12 libs.

Andrei, it took me nearly a week to get two people to test on linux on this 
list last time around.

Maybe try general? Just a thought.

Hi Andrei,

As far as I'm aware, Elizabeth currently is the only person equipped to roll 
the official doze stuff for PHP-GTK. I can manage most things, but PHP-GTK 
has so many dependencies and I have so much 'stuff' floating around on my 
creaking system I'm bound to end up missing half the package out. That's 
what happened last time, and that's why I don't want to repeat the 
experience :) maybe when I get my next laptop I'll think about this before 
installing every *nix/win32 port known to man in root.

Bob and Anant were talking at some point about renaming PHP-GTK extension 
.so files to have a 2 on the end. I can't recall if anyone got around to 
actually doing this. If it requires changes to PHP-GTK sources I'll need to 
adapt win32 build system to deal with it prior to beta-tagging.

I also would like to know if anyone tested the changes I made to Elizabeth's 
GD 'hack' for Windows, since I actually don't know how to test it...

- Steph

I can change PHP-GTK to output php-gtk2.so if we so desire (but the  
extension .so's will not be versioned this way).

&gt; As far as I'm aware, Elizabeth currently is the only person  
&gt; equipped to roll the official doze stuff for PHP-GTK. I can manage  
&gt; most things, but PHP-GTK has so many dependencies and I have so  
&gt; much 'stuff' floating around on my creaking system I'm bound to end  
&gt; up missing half the package out. That's what happened last time,  
&gt; and that's why I don't want to repeat the experience :) maybe when  
&gt; I get my next laptop I'll think about this before installing every  
&gt; *nix/win32 port known to man in root.
&gt;
&gt; Bob and Anant were talking at some point about renaming PHP-GTK  
&gt; extension .so files to have a 2 on the end. I can't recall if  
&gt; anyone got around to actually doing this. If it requires changes to  
&gt; PHP-GTK sources I'll need to adapt win32 build system to deal with  
&gt; it prior to beta-tagging.
&gt;
&gt; I also would like to know if anyone tested the changes I made to  
&gt; Elizabeth's GD 'hack' for Windows, since I actually don't know how  
&gt; to test it...
&gt;
&gt; - Steph

&gt;&gt; Since I haven't heard any "no"'s, I'll be making a release

My bad - the idea wasn't to suffix names with 2, but to prefix them with 
php_gtk_ (in line with our .dll naming conventions). The idea being to 
prevent third-party library collisions.

&gt;I can change PHP-GTK to output php-gtk2.so if we so desire (but the 
&gt;extension .so's will not be versioned this way).

Correct. I think that ending up with sourceview.so is very wrong. The windows 
DLL's are named correctly, the Unix libraries should be too.

Let's just set a deadline please. If no one has time to test win32 GD 
stuff, we'll still release. It's not like it's a showstopper.

I propose Feb 29, cause it's a leap day.

Well, the gd stuff "works for me" - (windows xp and my builds) - no
guarantees it doesn't break other versions of windows

I found you can get around the hyphen issue if you don't mind abandoning 
'php-gtk' as the prefix. 'gtk' or 'phpgtk' will work just as well.

You just need to rename the INI declarations (and any reference to them) in 
php_gtk.c. I thought these were tied up with the module declaration in 
Zend/TSRM, but apparently not so:

//php.ini
error_reporting=E_ALL|E_STRICT
extension_dir=./
date.timezone=Europe/London
extension=php_gtk2.dll
phpgtk.codepage=CP1250
phpgtk.extensions=php_gtk_libglade2.dll

C:\sandbox\1053testarea&gt;php -r "print_r(get_declared_classes());"
// lots of stuff..
    [339] =&gt; Glade
    [340] =&gt; GladeXML
)

php -r "phpinfo(INFO_MODULES);"
...
...
php-gtk

GTK+ support =&gt; enabled
GTK+ v =&gt; 2.10.7

Directive =&gt; Local Value =&gt; Master Value
phpgtk.codepage =&gt; CP1250 =&gt; CP1250
phpgtk.extensions =&gt; php_gtk_libglade2.dll =&gt; php_gtk_libglade2.dll
...
...

C:\sandbox\1053testarea&gt;php -r "print_r(ini_get_all('php-gtk'));"
Array
(
    [phpgtk.codepage] =&gt; Array
        (
            [global_value] =&gt; CP1250
            [local_value] =&gt; CP1250
            [access] =&gt; 7
        )

    [phpgtk.extensions] =&gt; Array
        (
            [global_value] =&gt; php_gtk_libglade2.dll
            [local_value] =&gt; php_gtk_libglade2.dll

&gt;I can't seem to build a shared extension at all. I could look at the 
&gt;renaming issue once I've figured that out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I tested it with GtkSourceView only and it worked. Built,  installed, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; and ran it fine. However it still has the "wrong"  filename, it ends up 
&gt;&gt;&gt; as sourceview.so instead of  php_gtk2_sourceview.so.

&gt; Why do you change those ext/date/ directives???
&gt;
&gt; And it doesn't matter if a directive is registered or not. It's
&gt; perfectly valid to set any own values in php.ini. If you look at the
&gt; existing tests, you'll see what I mean. :D
&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt; ext/standard/tests/general_functions/parse_ini_basic.data

&gt;&gt; OK, those GC/build fixes are in CVS now (Dmitry/Stas awake).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Your fix + test with ext/date attached, should apply to 5_3 locally 
&gt;&gt; without
&gt;&gt; pain. I don't think there's any way to write a phpt test for this one
&gt;&gt; though, since there are no hyphens in the core INI directives.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I look into this once I get some free time. I'm quite busy at work 
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;right
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; now. It's simple though, you just need to allow the name have hyphen

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Propably just changing this line in zend_ini_scanner.l:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

Hi Anant,

&gt; Ok, looks like I get the same error on a fresh checkout. It's trying  to 
&gt; build sourceview *before* gtk+, which is why the gen_* files aren't  there 
&gt; yet.
&gt;
&gt; I thought we fixed the ordering issue sometime back - oddly this crops  up 
&gt; only when we use the =shared option.

Ah right, on doze we use the build script to make sure that our php_gtk.lib 
is built before we try building anything against it. It's not odd at all 
that static libs build anyway, since they're built into that same binary and 
share the same symbols.

&gt; As for libglade, it builds, but no .so is generated anywhere (still 
&gt; static) :-)

That's got to be a glitch in the build script for the extension, unless 
Andrei forced it to build static? (I was thinking of doing the same under 
doze... not sure yet.)

- Steph

Hi,

Can we make cairo a hard dependency for php-gtk? There are several functions
which require cairo support.

The famous ones include the gtk_print_context_* ones. More importantly,
direct cairo drawing support can be added by returning a CairoContext object
 from gdkWindow - leading to the availability of custom widgets.

So, we plan to define an #ifdef if cairo is found, and if it is not, we
simply don't build the corresponding methods (much like how the 2.8/2.10
overrides are handled currently). Is this approach OK?

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Akshat Gupta

 Reported By:      saul_porras at live dot com dot mx
 Status:           Open
 Bug Type:         PHP-GTK related
 Operating System: windows
 PHP Version:      5.2.6
 New Comment:

The Ñ works for me, here. I'm using the cvs version of php-gtk and gtk+
bundle 2.12.11. Try using newer verions of the gtk+ libs. Can you use
the ñ on other gtk+ powered apps?

Description:
------------
that is a small function however when i type á é ó í ú it gives me the
character ok i can even save it on to a mysql table fine.  but when i
type ñ it gives me a n i have tested it on many ways but i think that
the get_text() function is giving me that error.

i use the php 5.2 and gtk 2.0.1 and older versions tested too

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
$window = new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_size_request(400, 240);
$window-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('Gtk','main_quit'));
$window-&gt;add($vbox = new GtkVBox());

// display title
$title = new GtkLabel("setup entry");
$title-&gt;modify_font(new PangoFontDescription("Times New Roman Italic
10"));
$title-&gt;modify_fg(Gtk::STATE_NORMAL, GdkColor::parse("#0000ff"));
$title-&gt;set_size_request(-1, 40);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($title, 0, 0);


$item_number = new GtkEntry();
$item_number-&gt;connect('insert-text', 'on_insert'); // note 1

$hbox = new GtkHBox();
$hbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel('Item Number: '), 0, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($item_number, 0, 0);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($hbox);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel("Note: item numbers should contain only
numbers 0 to 9"), 0, 0);

$window-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();

function on_insert($entry, $text, $len, $position) {
    $text = substr($text, 0, $len); // this is the new text inserted
    echo $text;
    return false; // yes, let the default handler display the number
}

?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
get_text show me the ñ

Actual result:
--------------
shows a n

Don't have a lot of time to think about it right now, but seems fine. Elizabeth, 
Anant, how about you?

Hello,

I had trouble compiling php-gtk extensions as shared; they weren't 
correctly linked with their respective libraries. The following patch 
addresses this issue and I thought I'd share it with you so it could be 
incorporated into future versions.

On my side I do not experiment the 'Could not startup' error. Please
find below the full error trace.
Also I tried to rebuild from CVS and followed ur instructions bmajdak
and  it didn't change a thing. The `php -i | grep Configure` doesn't
echo anything...?

Hi,

I'm a programmer and I have a suggestion (or a question) about the
configure script of PHP-GTK 2.0.1.

I receive the message "Could not locate PHP executable" after try to
install PHP-GTK on Fedora Linux 7 / Apache 2.2.8 / PHP 5.2.6.

This message is in configure script, in my case, at line 3937. I saw that
the line 3917 has this test:

"if test -x $PHP_PREFIX/bin/php; then ..."

In fact it was checking if my PHP executable is in default path, but, in my
case, it is at "/usr/bin/php" (I've changed in PHP compilation). I don't
understand why it could not use "php-config --php-binary" to determine the
PHP executable location.

I could create a symbolic link in "$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php", but I change the
configure script to do this test:
"
  PHP=`$PHP_CONFIG --php-binary`
  if [ -x "$PHP" -o -x "$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php" ]; then
...
    if [ -x "$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php" ]; then
      PHP=$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php
    fi
...
"

And it works. The code is not so good, but the suggestion is to use
"php-config" not only to determine PHP_PREFIX, but the PHP executable too.

&gt; thanks

To call windows dlls you need a PHP extension that can handle it - the
code cweiske showed you uses ffi - available from pecl

You can also make some standard calls through the win32std extension -
also from pecl

Or you can try to find com versions of what you need and use them from
the com/.net extension which is standard with the windows version of PHP

Thanks,
Elizabeth

&gt;&gt; This fixes the link issue i was habing with gtkhtml (link error to that
&gt;&gt; funcion).
&gt;&gt; However, i don't think the second part of the patch is needed. We are
&gt;&gt; *removing* one function. Thus it should still work with older gtkhtml
&gt;&gt; versions which have it.

&gt;&gt; Description:
&gt;&gt; ------------
&gt;&gt; gtk_html_request_paste has been removed from gtkhtml.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; See : http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gtkhtml?view=revision&amp;revision=8594
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But still present until 3.18.3 in header.
&gt;&gt; This is now fixed :
&gt;&gt; http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gtkhtml?view=revision&amp;revision=8923
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think it should be removed from php-gtk.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Simple patch :

Looks safe to use.

Although instead of PHP, better use as variable name PHP_EXECUTABLE
which is the one used on phpize.m4 for `$PHP_CONFIG --php-binary 
2&gt;/dev/null`

 New Comment:

Thank you for your bug report. This issue has already been fixed
in the latest released version of PHP, which you can download at 
http://www.php.net/downloads.php

Since 2.0.0 this is no longer an issue - windows releases have the
appropriate dlls and the toolbar set_style was renamed to avoid
conflicts

Christian - this is not an appropriate forum in which to start a
debate. Please stick to the dev list if you want to challenge our
assessment of the problem (that's mine and Andrei's).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2006-08-20 08:25:37] cweiske@php.net

The warning:
&gt; "Strict Standards: Declaration of GtkToolbar::set_style() 
&gt; should be compatible with that of GtkWidget::set_style()"
*is* down to E_STRICT standards, and we already discussed this issue on
the list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2006-08-20 08:20:27] sfox@php.net

There's no intl.dll because when I tested the dependencies for the GTK
runtime package intl.dll didn't come up as being one of them. I'll
re-test and try to establish why, but in the meantime could you please
tell me how you came to the conclusion there was a missing dependency?
(Was there an error message for example?)

Those errors aren't down to E_STRICT being enabled, they're down to
display_startup_errors being turned on. Outside of that, E_STRICT is
fine (in fact I develop with E_STRICT enabled too). 

I have already discussed the startup errors at some length with Andrei,
Dmitry Stogov and Andi Gutmans on the PHP internals list, because it's
down to the way internal object inheritance is defined in the Zend
Engine now. Dmitry advised me that the patch I offered at the time (or
any other fix) would NOT be applied because the existing definition is
correct for PHP internal objects, and it's not PHP's problem if
third-party objects don't adhere to that definition. So this part of the
two-part bug report is likely to be a 'won't fix', unless Andrei comes
up with some cute way to force GTK objects to comply with PHP
inheritance rules. 

Just turn display_startup_errors off. It's off by default anyway.

You have E_STRICT settings activated. PHP-Gtk2 currently is not
compatible with this setting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2006-08-19 23:07:50] cweiske at cweiske dot de

Description:
------------
First problem is that in ythe GTK+-Packages there is no "intl.dll", i
found a working in the web while the one that is provided by "MySQL
Administrator" did not work.

--

Now the php_gtk2.dll loads but on every script-call even a "php -v"
errors like the following will be shown 

"Strict Standards: Declaration of GtkToolbar::set_style() should be
compatible with that of GtkWidget::set_style()"

Thank you for this bug report. To properly diagnose the problem, we
need a short but complete example script to be able to reproduce
this bug ourselves. 

A proper reproducing script starts with &lt;?php and ends with ?&gt;,
is max. 10-20 lines long and does not require any external 
resources such as databases, etc. If the script requires a 
database to demonstrate the issue, please make sure it creates 
all necessary tables, stored procedures etc.

Please avoid embedding huge scripts into the report.

I don't see this issue with newer versions

I shall try and dig out the code i tested at the time.
If not the GtkList Object is easily created from one of the demos. I
shall add the callback function and see how i get on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-03-16 14:38:06] auroraeosrose@php.net

Please try using this CVS snapshot:

  http://snaps.php.net/php5.2-latest.tar.gz
 
For Windows (zip):
 
  http://snaps.php.net/win32/php5.2-win32-latest.zip

For Windows (installer):

  http://snaps.php.net/win32/php5.2-win32-installer-latest.msi

Does this still occur with newer versions?

[2007-04-05 16:43:53] james dot smith at cybertill dot co dot uk

Description:
------------
While designing a Till system using php gtk2 and grabbing code from
several examples. I encountered the following problem.
When clicking on an item in a GtkListStore object, the callback
function is either renamed/ stored incorrectly.

Despite me renaming it several times the function name is not handled
properly and causes characters to be misinterpreted.


$sectionBasketView = GtkListStore( Gtk::TYPE_STRING, Gtk::TYPE_LONG,
Gtk::TYPE_DOUBLE);
.
.
    $selection = $sectionBasketView-&gt;get_selection();
    $selection-&gt;connect('changed', "on_selection");
.
.
function on_selection()
{
.

Expected result:
----------------
on_selection function execution


Actual result:
--------------
The error log shows that the 9th character is pushed up by 1 character
code.
Here is a report from the error.txt it produced.
The first instance the letter "t" being replaced with a "s" character.
The second instance "i" renamed the function call with a "j" at the
start
this in turn affected the next character "c" changing to a "b".
As far as i can tell the on_selection is not used anywhere else.
Is this an inbuilt command/event/property?

I may have misunderstood the previous messages on this, but isn't there 
a revision of the php help system going on?  I thought that was the real 
holdup in turning the user notes back on....

Please note that, as I noticed after sending the email to this list, it 
won't work on a completely clean Linux (a clean left some files behind).
You may need to uncomment the 'defined at gen_{$widget_name}.h' and 
maybe remove its include. Check the exact error. The generated makefile 
missed a dependency and the bits that would need to be changed weren't 
provided by php-gtk but on the php config.m4, then used by phpize.
It's still an improvement, but not as complete as I originally intended.

I look forward to your comments.

You're right, second part is specific to Fedora and gtkhml 3.18.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-08-17 22:26:03] Keisial at gmail dot com

This fixes the link issue i was habing with gtkhtml (link error to that
funcion).
However, i don't think the second part of the patch is needed. We are
*removing* one function. Thus it should still work with older gtkhtml
versions which have it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-08-17 15:00:01] Fedora at FamilleCollet dot com

Description:
------------
gtk_html_request_paste has been removed from gtkhtml.

See : 
http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gtkhtml?view=revision&amp;revision=8594

But still present until 3.18.3 in header.
This is now fixed :
http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gtkhtml?view=revision&amp;revision=8923

I think it should be removed from php-gtk.

Simple patch :
http://rpms.famillecollet.com/files/php-gtk-html318.patch

Regards

Fixed :)

This time i uploaded my test script too.

http://enygmata.site88.net/gtksourceview2/

Changes:
 - Constants are accessible through GtkSourceView class.
 - php_sourceview2.c merged with php_sourceview.c and php_sourceview2.h
merged with php_sourceview.h


note #1: gtksourceview2 stuff wont be accessible if you have
"--with-sourceview" in your configure command
            (to avoid conflicts)
note #2: many class/method names have been changed on gtksourceview2.
note #3: i have not tried to compile it on windows but i think it works,
could someone please do it?
note #4: the patch include changes for config.m4, config.w32 and
generator.php
note #5: you should put all the sourceview2.* files at sourceview extension
dir
note #6: tested with php 5.2.6 and php-gtk 2.0.1 (linux)

bye bye \o/

&gt; 
&gt; In 5.3 a class in a namespace has colons in the full name - gobject's
&gt; register type does not allow colons in a name when you register the type
&gt; 
&gt; Attached is a small dirty hack to fix that - it copies the class's name,
&gt; replaces colons with underscores, and then uses the underscore version
&gt; to register the type.
&gt; 
&gt; This works fine - only caveat is you can't have a class in namespace
&gt; foo::bar::baz AND register a class named foo__bar__baz - I'm fairly
&gt; certain that won't be a common problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless someone has a better idea I'll commit this version.

I recently had the need to create a php-gtk extension, and what i found 
wasn't too pleasant.
Most code (gen_*.c) is autogenerated from the defs file by 
generator/generator.php. Which itself is made by running h2def.py on the 
C header. Well, it turns out generator/h2def.py is outdated. And by 
outdated i mean that generator/generator.php *won't be able to process 
that file*. Oops.
The solution is using the newer one maintained by the pygtk folks at 
http://svn.gnome.org/svn/pygobject/trunk/codegen
It also has improvements such as no longer needing to edit the defs file 
in order to specify which is the constructor.


Where to get the other files an extension needs? Well, there's a 
skeleton extension precisely for a basis for that, right? Wrong! It is 
also outdated. php_skeleton_register_constants() doesn't expect a 
module_number, but a const char* Using it you get a nice sigsegv on runtime.

Finally, there's ext_skel, a shell script to copy the skeleton dir to 
the widget's and avoid you the trouble or replacing each skeleton 
occurrence by the new widget's name. It's also broken, although this may 
be just in my setup.


So, you end up copying one of the working widgets and changing the name 
in lots of places, with different capitalizations. You invariably forget 
some, and have to try compiling several times until you get it right. As 
Bob said when i asked how to create php-gtk extensions, "it is just not 
very fun to do".
That labour would better be achieved by a script, and so i went into 
making it.

This new script resides in generator/ext_gen.php and hooks into the 
build process, based on ext_data.php on each extension folder. You can 
use it once to generate the files which you will then customize, or 
leave them autogenerate on each build. This point is specially 
interesting because most extensions haven't changed since they were 
created by copy &amp; replace, and provides a single point of improvement 
into the system. Also, by keeping the generator in use by a number of 
extensions, it is guaranteed to be kept up-to-date.

Each extension defines a few parameters into the file ext_data.php, and 
can have most its files autogenerated. The new generated scripts are 
(expected to be) equivalent to the old ones. In fact, much of it is the 
same code, to make a cvs diff as smaller as possible. However, there's a 
number of improvements:
-grep | sed process replaced by just a sed
-gen_*.h created a bit more independed from gen_*.c
-Makefiles actions in one line broken on several.
-gen_*.h will include the prototypes of the exported functions of 
gen_*.c, which would have warned the issue of the register_constants() 
parameter type at compile time.
-php_*.h will include gen_*.h instead of placing the prototypes.
-Minor differences on text presented to the user, usually just of 
capitalization (eg. 'Disable libglade support' vs 'Disable libGlade 
support').


Transitioned extensions: extra, html, libglade, libsexy
Unchanged: gtk+ (lots of special stuff), mozembed (three different 
modules), scintilla (several customizations), spell (standalone)
I have done my best to ensure it doesn't break anything, but any 
comments are welcome. You can also reach me at #php-gtk. The extensions 
still build fine on Linux with the patch. On windows, it still fails, as 
it did without it, so SNAFU.

Added files:
 extra/ext_data.php

From:             Fedora at FamilleCollet dot com
Operating system: Linux (Fedora 9)
PHP version:      5.3.0alpha1
PHP Bug Type:     PHP-GTK related
Bug description:  zend_set_timeout args have changes change

Description:
------------
Working on latest php-5.3.0alpha2-dev (200808170830 snapshot).

zend_set_timeout args function args have changes :

ZEND_API void zend_set_timeout(long seconds, int reset_signals);

Reading the source code (diff from 5.2.6), it seems the new option
reset_signals should be set to 1 to have previous behaviour.

Simple patch proposal :
http://rpms.famillecollet.com/files/php-gtk-php53.patch


Reproduce code:
---------------
update to latest php 5.3 snapshot

make 



Expected result:
----------------
Build complete.


Actual result:
--------------
/home/rpmbuild/BUILD/php-gtk-2.0.1/main/php_gtk.c:171: error: too few
arguments to function 'zend_set_timeout'

&gt; 
&gt; This fixes the link issue i was habing with gtkhtml (link error to that
&gt; funcion).
&gt; However, i don't think the second part of the patch is needed. We are
&gt; *removing* one function. Thus it should still work with older gtkhtml
&gt; versions which have it.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a programmer and I have a suggestion (or a question) about the
&gt; configure script of PHP-GTK 2.0.1.
&gt; 
&gt; I receive the message "Could not locate PHP executable" after try to
&gt; install PHP-GTK on Fedora Linux 7 / Apache 2.2.8 / PHP 5.2.6.
&gt; 
&gt; This message is in configure script, in my case, at line 3937. I saw that
&gt; the line 3917 has this test:
&gt; 
&gt; "if test -x $PHP_PREFIX/bin/php; then ..."
&gt; 
&gt; In fact it was checking if my PHP executable is in default path, but, in my
&gt; case, it is at "/usr/bin/php" (I've changed in PHP compilation). I don't
&gt; understand why it could not use "php-config --php-binary" to determine the
&gt; PHP executable location.
&gt; 
&gt; I could create a symbolic link in "$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php", but I change the
&gt; configure script to do this test:
&gt; "
&gt;   PHP=`$PHP_CONFIG --php-binary`
&gt;   if [ -x "$PHP" -o -x "$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php" ]; then
&gt; ...
&gt;     if [ -x "$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php" ]; then
&gt;       PHP=$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php
&gt;     fi
&gt; ...
&gt; "
&gt; 
&gt; And it works. The code is not so good, but the suggestion is to use
&gt; "php-config" not only to determine PHP_PREFIX, but the PHP executable too.

Hey, this looks interesting!

I'm catching up on older mail, so I just now saw this. Looks like this 
could be a great replacement for ext_skel and more. I'll take a closer 
look in a bit.

Keisial wrote:
&gt; I recently had the need to create a php-gtk extension, and what i found 
&gt; wasn't too pleasant.
&gt; Most code (gen_*.c) is autogenerated from the defs file by 
&gt; generator/generator.php. Which itself is made by running h2def.py on the 
&gt; C header. Well, it turns out generator/h2def.py is outdated. And by 
&gt; outdated i mean that generator/generator.php *won't be able to process 
&gt; that file*. Oops.
&gt; The solution is using the newer one maintained by the pygtk folks at 
&gt; http://svn.gnome.org/svn/pygobject/trunk/codegen
&gt; It also has improvements such as no longer needing to edit the defs file 
&gt; in order to specify which is the constructor.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Where to get the other files an extension needs? Well, there's a 
&gt; skeleton extension precisely for a basis for that, right? Wrong! It is 
&gt; also outdated. php_skeleton_register_constants() doesn't expect a 
&gt; module_number, but a const char* Using it you get a nice sigsegv on 
&gt; runtime.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, there's ext_skel, a shell script to copy the skeleton dir to 
&gt; the widget's and avoid you the trouble or replacing each skeleton 
&gt; occurrence by the new widget's name. It's also broken, although this may 
&gt; be just in my setup.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, you end up copying one of the working widgets and changing the name 
&gt; in lots of places, with different capitalizations. You invariably forget 
&gt; some, and have to try compiling several times until you get it right. As 
&gt; Bob said when i asked how to create php-gtk extensions, "it is just not 
&gt; very fun to do".
&gt; That labour would better be achieved by a script, and so i went into 
&gt; making it.
&gt; 
&gt; This new script resides in generator/ext_gen.php and hooks into the 
&gt; build process, based on ext_data.php on each extension folder. You can 
&gt; use it once to generate the files which you will then customize, or 
&gt; leave them autogenerate on each build. This point is specially 
&gt; interesting because most extensions haven't changed since they were 
&gt; created by copy &amp; replace, and provides a single point of improvement 
&gt; into the system. Also, by keeping the generator in use by a number of 
&gt; extensions, it is guaranteed to be kept up-to-date.
&gt; 
&gt; Each extension defines a few parameters into the file ext_data.php, and 
&gt; can have most its files autogenerated. The new generated scripts are 
&gt; (expected to be) equivalent to the old ones. In fact, much of it is the 
&gt; same code, to make a cvs diff as smaller as possible. However, there's a 
&gt; number of improvements:
&gt; -grep | sed process replaced by just a sed
&gt; -gen_*.h created a bit more independed from gen_*.c
&gt; -Makefiles actions in one line broken on several.
&gt; -gen_*.h will include the prototypes of the exported functions of 
&gt; gen_*.c, which would have warned the issue of the register_constants() 
&gt; parameter type at compile time.
&gt; -php_*.h will include gen_*.h instead of placing the prototypes.
&gt; -Minor differences on text presented to the user, usually just of 
&gt; capitalization (eg. 'Disable libglade support' vs 'Disable libGlade 
&gt; support').
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Transitioned extensions: extra, html, libglade, libsexy
&gt; Unchanged: gtk+ (lots of special stuff), mozembed (three different 
&gt; modules), scintilla (several customizations), spell (standalone)
&gt; I have done my best to ensure it doesn't break anything, but any 
&gt; comments are welcome. You can also reach me at #php-gtk. The extensions 
&gt; still build fine on Linux with the patch. On windows, it still fails, as 
&gt; it did without it, so SNAFU.
&gt; 
&gt; Added files:
&gt; extra/ext_data.php
&gt; html/ext_data.php
&gt; libglade/ext_data.php
&gt; libsexy/ext_data.php
&gt; generator/ext_gen.php
&gt; 
&gt; Modified:
&gt; win32/buildconf.js
&gt; build2/build.mk
&gt; 
&gt; Removed:
&gt; generator/h2def.py
&gt; ext/ext_skel
&gt; ext/skeleton/* [keep skeleton.overrides?]
&gt; 
&gt; Deprecated:
&gt; extra/config.m4,config.w32,Makefile.frag,php_gtkextra.c,php_gtkextra.h

&gt; libsexy/config.m4,config.w32,Makefile.frag,php_libsexy.c,php_libsexy.h
&gt;

Bug description:  ñ is not supported

Description:
------------
that is a small function however when i type á é ó í ú it gives me the
character ok i can even save it on to a mysql table fine.  but when i type
ñ it gives me a n i have tested it on many ways but i think that the
get_text() function is giving me that error.

i use the php 5.2 and gtk 2.0.1 and older versions tested too

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
$window = new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_size_request(400, 240);
$window-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('Gtk','main_quit'));
$window-&gt;add($vbox = new GtkVBox());

// display title
$title = new GtkLabel("setup entry");
$title-&gt;modify_font(new PangoFontDescription("Times New Roman Italic
10"));
$title-&gt;modify_fg(Gtk::STATE_NORMAL, GdkColor::parse("#0000ff"));
$title-&gt;set_size_request(-1, 40);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($title, 0, 0);


$item_number = new GtkEntry();
$item_number-&gt;connect('insert-text', 'on_insert'); // note 1

$hbox = new GtkHBox();
$hbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel('Item Number: '), 0, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($item_number, 0, 0);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($hbox);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel("Note: item numbers should contain only
numbers 0 to 9"), 0, 0);

$window-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();

function on_insert($entry, $text, $len, $position) {
    $text = substr($text, 0, $len); // this is the new text inserted
    echo $text;
    return false; // yes, let the default handler display the number
}

?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
get_text show me the ñ

Actual result:
--------------
shows a n

In CVS; obviously :)
See http://gtk.php.net/download.php at the bottom. You will need to
compile it, which is not too easy on windows. I can send you the
binaries if you prefer.
Still, I suspect it's a problem with the gtk libs and not php-gtk
itself.

sorry did not saw your message,, were can i find the cvs version of
php-gtk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-08-27 17:18:05] saul_porras at live dot com dot mx

sorry i am missing something that is one of the ways i tried to return
the text from the gtk entry also tried get_text() and did not worked
either then the gtk entry is not sending me the ñ charactarer with any
method

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-08-27 17:16:12] Keisial at gmail dot com

The Ñ works for me, here. I'm using the cvs version of php-gtk and gtk+
bundle 2.12.11. Try using newer verions of the gtk+ libs. Can you use
the ñ on other gtk+ powered apps?

Description:
------------
that is a small function however when i type á é ó í ú it gives me the
character ok i can even save it on to a mysql table fine.  but when i
type ñ it gives me a n i have tested it on many ways but i think that
the get_text() function is giving me that error.

i use the php 5.2 and gtk 2.0.1 and older versions tested too

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
$window = new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_size_request(400, 240);
$window-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('Gtk','main_quit'));
$window-&gt;add($vbox = new GtkVBox());

// display title
$title = new GtkLabel("setup entry");
$title-&gt;modify_font(new PangoFontDescription("Times New Roman Italic
10"));
$title-&gt;modify_fg(Gtk::STATE_NORMAL, GdkColor::parse("#0000ff"));
$title-&gt;set_size_request(-1, 40);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($title, 0, 0);


$item_number = new GtkEntry();
$item_number-&gt;connect('insert-text', 'on_insert'); // note 1

$hbox = new GtkHBox();
$hbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel('Item Number: '), 0, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($item_number, 0, 0);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($hbox);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel("Note: item numbers should contain only
numbers 0 to 9"), 0, 0);

$window-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();

function on_insert($entry, $text, $len, $position) {
    $text = substr($text, 0, $len); // this is the new text inserted
    echo $text;
    return false; // yes, let the default handler display the number
}

?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
get_text show me the ñ

Actual result:
--------------
shows a n

Elizabeth and I discussed this on IRC earlier, and decided it would be  
best to go ahead with #ifdef's, just like we do for 2.10/2.12 widgets  
currently.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; Can we make cairo a hard dependency for php-gtk? There are several

&gt;&gt; which require cairo support.
&gt;&gt; The famous ones include the gtk_print_context_* ones. More

&gt;&gt; direct cairo drawing support can be added by returning a  
&gt;&gt; CairoContext object
&gt;&gt; from gdkWindow - leading to the availability of custom widgets.
&gt;&gt; So, we plan to define an #ifdef if cairo is found, and if it is  
&gt;&gt; not, we
&gt;&gt; simply don't build the corresponding methods (much like how the  
&gt;&gt; 2.8/2.10
&gt;&gt; overrides are handled currently). Is this approach OK?
&gt;&gt; Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Hello,

We have a fairly serious issue with the *nix end of the build system,
namely GTK library versioning is broken so users are only getting 2.6
features even if they have newer libs.  I have no clue how all that
automagic junk works so someone else is going to have to chase down the
issue, but I wanted to make sure it gets fixed as the cairo stuff is
getting ready to go in and the poor cairo guy can't build php-gtk with
2.12 support to test stuff ;)

I've been working with php-gtk on 5.3, compiles fine and runs fine
except for one small issue.

In 5.3 a class in a namespace has colons in the full name - gobject's
register type does not allow colons in a name when you register the type

Attached is a small dirty hack to fix that - it copies the class's name,
replaces colons with underscores, and then uses the underscore version
to register the type.

This works fine - only caveat is you can't have a class in namespace
foo::bar::baz AND register a class named foo__bar__baz - I'm fairly
certain that won't be a common problem.

Unless someone has a better idea I'll commit this version.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

The Ñ works for me, here. I'm using the cvs version of php-gtk and gtk+

the ñ on other gtk+ powered apps?

    echo $text;
    return false; // yes, let the default handler display the number
}

Expected result:
----------------
get_text show me the ñ

Actual result:
--------------
shows a n

sorry i am missing something that is one of the ways i tried to return
the text from the gtk entry also tried get_text() and did not worked
either then the gtk entry is not sending me the ñ charactarer with any
method

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2008-08-27 17:16:12] Keisial at gmail dot com

The Ñ works for me, here. I'm using the cvs version of php-gtk and gtk+
bundle 2.12.11. Try using newer verions of the gtk+ libs. Can you use
the ñ on other gtk+ powered apps?

Description:
------------
that is a small function however when i type á é ó í ú it gives me the
character ok i can even save it on to a mysql table fine.  but when i
type ñ it gives me a n i have tested it on many ways but i think that
the get_text() function is giving me that error.

i use the php 5.2 and gtk 2.0.1 and older versions tested too

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
$window = new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_size_request(400, 240);
$window-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('Gtk','main_quit'));
$window-&gt;add($vbox = new GtkVBox());

// display title
$title = new GtkLabel("setup entry");
$title-&gt;modify_font(new PangoFontDescription("Times New Roman Italic
10"));
$title-&gt;modify_fg(Gtk::STATE_NORMAL, GdkColor::parse("#0000ff"));
$title-&gt;set_size_request(-1, 40);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($title, 0, 0);


$item_number = new GtkEntry();
$item_number-&gt;connect('insert-text', 'on_insert'); // note 1

$hbox = new GtkHBox();
$hbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel('Item Number: '), 0, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($item_number, 0, 0);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start($hbox);
$vbox-&gt;pack_start(new GtkLabel("Note: item numbers should contain only
numbers 0 to 9"), 0, 0);

$window-&gt;show_all();

In CVS; obviously :)
See http://gtk.php.net/download.php at the bottom. You will need to
compile it, which is not too easy on windows. I can send you the
binaries if you prefer.
Still, I suspect it's a problem with the gtk libs and not php-gtk
itself.

 Operating System: Win XP sp2
 PHP Version:      5.2.6
 New Comment:

Starting with PHP-GTK 2.0.0 the TYPE constants were moved from the
Gtk:: class to Gobject, so use Gobject::TYPE_STRING instead.

This is fixed in the new documentation, but it's not on the website yet
(we're migrating it to the new PHP manual format)  and is also addressed
in the PHP-GTK changelog

http://gtk.php.net/changelog.php

It was also discussed on the mailing lists - please check the mailing
list archives, the irc channel, or other sources of help instead of
filing bugs for coding issues.

&gt; Basically it's when one of the two or three people (including myself)

&gt; clist is deprecated that's probably not going to happen anytime soon) or
&gt; have time to do it just to finish it off.  Probably the best way to get

Does this also apply to php_gtk_html2.dll?

Is there any feel for when the clist selection problem might be fixed?
I'm at the point where I have to make a kill-switch kind of decision on
how to pull off an upgrade - before my customers start looking at the exits.

thanks,
Madeleine D.

Basically it's when one of the two or three people (including myself)
who write overrides or work on the source have a need for it (since
clist is deprecated that's probably not going to happen anytime soon) or
have time to do it just to finish it off.  Probably the best way to get
it done is to pay someone a little bit to do it if you really need it,
otherwise it's a matter of where is the override on the priorities
list...  Unfortunately with my new job and working on PHP on windows
support stuff I'm short on time at the moment.

Thanks,
Elizabeth
