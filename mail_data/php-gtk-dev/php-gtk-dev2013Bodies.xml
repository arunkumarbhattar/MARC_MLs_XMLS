From:             gianluca dot faieta at gmail dot com
Operating system: Windows
PHP version:      Irrelevant
Package:          PHP-GTK related
Bug Type:         Bug
Bug description:Stock browser demo exception with some locales

Description:
------------
The stock icons browser from php-gtk-src demos throws exception when run
under 
italian, spanish and french locales (Control Panels &gt; Region and Language).
It 
works normally when run under english, german and dutch locales.

The script was tested on Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows XP SP2 and
Windows 7 
with same error. Multiple PHP binaries were tested, with same outcome:

- http://emsmith.net/gtk/php-5.3.15-nts-php-gtk-snapshot.zip
- http://emsmith.net/gtk/php-5.4.5-nts-php-gtk-snapshot.zip
- http://emsmith.net/gtk/php-gtk-2012-5.4-snapshot.zip

Old php-gtk package works (http://gtk.php.net/do_download.php?
download_file=php-gtk-2.0.1-win32-nts.zip)


Test script:
---------------
https://raw.github.com/php/php-gtk-src/master/demos/stock-browser.php

Actual result:
--------------
Warning: Could not convert item label from UTF-8 in
C:\zdemos\stock-browser.php 
on line 120

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PhpGtkGErrorException' with message
'Sequenza di 
byte non valida nell'ingresso per la conversione' in C:\zdemos\stock-

Can you please submit the code again where its visible to see, the old one seems to \
have been lost.

Also, can you compile PHP-GTK with debugging symbols and regenerate the BT?

(http://www.compdigitec.com/labs/2009/01/14/binary-packages-php-cli-528-and-php-gtk-201/), \
it can be confirmed this bug still exists:

Same as the other report, could you please re-upload the patch?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2009-10-30 22:26:50] ptlis at ptlis dot net

Description:
------------
Simple one-line documentation fix; The documentation of the parameters for the \
GtkMessageDialog constructor has a typo; as such the documentation of the \
GtkMessageType enum was not linked to.

The patch can be found at http://ptlis.net/temp/gtkmessage.xml.patch

I can't reproduce this with the current code from 

https://git.php.net/repository/php/gtk-src.git

with PHP 5.3 or 5.4

1. are you using a distribution build of PHP? ubuntu puts patches on PHP source
2. does this still occur with the newer version of php-gtk code?
3. what version of the gtk libraries are you using?

Description:
------------
Used php-gtk: trunk at 2011-12-11

The provided script could be parametrized with the defines in the first lines.
I provide a version which shows the bug (define('SHOW_BUG', true)), another one, \
which avoids the bug (define('SHOW_BUG', false)) and another one, which presents a \
workaround (define('USE_WORKAROUND', true)).

The bug occurs when one uses menu entries with mnemonics in their names in \
conjunction with a circular reference in classes using php-gtk. the bug doesn't occur \
if either the circular reference is resolved manually or if there isn't any menu \
entry with a mnemonic in its name.

Test script:
---------------
a minimal script which reproduces the bug is located at
http://tasteful-revolution.net/bug.php.txt

Expected result:
----------------
When I close the window, the script should terminate normally.

Actual result:
--------------
When I close the window, the script doesn't terminate but leaves the gtk main loop.

Thank you for this bug report. To properly diagnose the problem, we
need a backtrace to see what is happening behind the scenes. To
find out how to generate a backtrace, please read
http://bugs.php.net/bugs-generating-backtrace.php for *NIX and
http://bugs.php.net/bugs-generating-backtrace-win32.php for Win32

Once you have generated a backtrace, please submit it to this bug
report and change the status back to "Open". Thank you for helping
us make PHP better.

Do you have the correct ini setting for php-gtk?  This WILL not work unless you \
change your php-gtk.codepage = UTF-8 in php-cli.ini

What is happening is gtk can't convert the string given by the localization to the \
codepage you have set in your ini, and then PHP is fatal erroring because the string \
has invalid bytes

Setting php-gtk.codepage to either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 in php.ini fixes the

From:             utilmind at gmail dot com
Operating system: Any, tested in Win32 and CentOS
PHP version:      5.4.22
Package:          PHP-GTK related
Bug Type:         Bug
Bug description:X*5/X where X is floating point number is greater than 5

Description:
------------
It's probably bug with conversion from floating point number, or bug
with comparision between types. We know that X*5/5 is 5. Even PHP
returns 5, however, sometimes, returned value appears to be greater than
5.

Test script:
---------------
$n = (3.89880952381*5/3.89880952381); // result will be exactly 5
print $n.'!=5 ? '.($n&gt;5); // here it appears that 5 is greater than 5

 New Comment:

Floating point values have a limited precision. Hence a value might 
not have the same string representation after any processing. That also
includes writing a floating point value in your script and directly 
printing it without any mathematical operations.

If you would like to know more about "floats" and what IEEE
754 is, read this:
http://www.floating-point-gui.de/

Thank you for your interest in PHP.

php &gt; ini_set("precision", 17);
php &gt; $n = (3.89880952381*5/3.89880952381); // result will be a very bit greater than \
5 php &gt; var_dump($n);

Test script:
---------------
$n = (3.89880952381*5/3.89880952381); // result will be exactly 5
print $n.'!=5 ? '.($n&gt;5); // here it appears that 5 is greater than 5

The "ini_set("precision", 17);" explains the origin of the problem, but does not \
solves it.

The problem is not that floating point operations makes little inaccuracies.

My point is that, if PHP with low precision setting rounds values for visual \
representation of inaccurate numbers, it should also round them on compare operations \
like &lt; &gt; and ==. Otherwise, we currently getting a value, which looks exactly like \
"5", but actually it little bit more than "5".

Currently following type conversion operation fixes the problem:
$n = (float)(string)(3.89880952381*5/3.89880952381);
but it's not ideal. The "precision" option of php.ini should also affect on logical \
comparison operations.

Floating point values have a limited precision. Hence a value might 
not have the same string representation after any processing. That also
includes writing a floating point value in your script and directly 
printing it without any mathematical operations.

If you would like to know more about "floats" and what IEEE
754 is, read this:

Thank you for your interest in PHP.

php &gt; ini_set("precision", 17);
php &gt; $n = (3.89880952381*5/3.89880952381); // result will be a very bit greater than \
5 php &gt; var_dump($n);
float(5.0000000000000009)

This is an PHP main package bug

Confirmed

Version: PHP 5.5.1-2 (built: Aug  5 2013 14:10:28)
OS: Linux version 3.10-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.10.5-1 (2013-08-07)

Description:
------------
It's probably bug with conversion from floating point number, or bug with comparision \
between types. We know that X*5/5 is 5. Even PHP returns 5, however, sometimes, \
returned value appears to be greater than 5.

Test script:
---------------
$n = (3.89880952381*5/3.89880952381); // result will be exactly 5
print $n.'!=5 ? '.($n&gt;5); // here it appears that 5 is greater than 5
