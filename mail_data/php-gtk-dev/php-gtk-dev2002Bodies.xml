Hello Friends,

I am developing a  .so file (shared module ) on linux 7.1 . I got  following
sample source code from www.php.net.
which I  saved  in Test.cpp file.
/* include standard header */
#include "php.h"

/* declaration of functions to be exported */
ZEND_FUNCTION(first_module);

/* compiled function list so Zend knows what's in this module */
zend_function_entry firstmod_functions[] =
{
    ZEND_FE(first_module, NULL)
    {NULL, NULL, NULL}
};

/* compiled module information */
zend_module_entry firstmod_module_entry =
{
    STANDARD_MODULE_HEADER,
    "First Module",
    firstmod_functions,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NO_VERSION_YET,
    STANDARD_MODULE_PROPERTIES
};

/* implement standard "stub" routine to introduce ourselves to Zend */
#if COMPILE_DL_FIRST_MODULE
ZEND_GET_MODULE(firstmod)
#endif

/* implement function that is meant to be made available to PHP */
ZEND_FUNCTION(first_module)
{
    long parameter;

    if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, "l", &amp;parameter) ==
FAILURE) {
        return;
    }

    RETURN_LONG(parameter);
}


I compliled it as follows:
g++ -fpic -DCOMPILE_DL=1 -I/usr/local/include -I. -I.. -I../Zend -c -o
Test.o Test.cpp
and linked it as:
g++ -shared -L/usr/local/lib -rdynamic -o LibTest.so Test.o
After executing these commands, I got a libTest.so library, that I copied
into /usr/lib/php4 directory.
Now problem is when I call it from .php file by using statement
dll("libTest.so);
I got a  warnning "Invalid library (maybe not a PHP library) 'libTest.so' in
/var/www/html/Test.php on line 6"
Help me.
I shall be very thankful.

I dont know if anyone else can shine some light onto this one - I've not

&gt;&gt; Dont get too excited, it doesnt do that much :)
&gt;
&gt; Ok, I promise I won't! :-)
&gt; BTW, phpmole is a bit crowded, don't you think?

Very much so :) like ivy it had a habit of growing

&gt;
&gt; Have you considered spliting the different applications so that they 
&gt; can be run separately?

Yes, but at present it solves the need it was designed to address. So I 
guess when I get really annoyed with it one day, I might attack that..

Hi!

What's wrong with the docs section of gtk.php.net? There's no docs available at all for days 
(at least - I didn't try before). How soon can you fix this problem? Are the earlier docs 
available somewhere?

Thank you &amp; regards

I've just spent about a week trying to make sense of this.

Andrei already did something to it so it will only accept 5 parameters (user_data \
doesn't seem to get accepted unless I'm doing some bad thing to it).

The first two parameters should always be null for a popup menu.  They are there \
because they are used internally to associate a popup with a menubar or optionmenu \
(because there is NO SUCH THING AS A DROPDOWN GTKMENU).

The third parameter refers to another callback function which needs to return an \
array of co-ordinates (x, y).  It can be null, and if so there is a default in place \
for it (the menu pops up at the pointer position).

The fourth parameter does nothing, even in the depths of GTK code, and really \
shouldn't be there at all as it refers to mouse-button options in a callback which \
could equally well be triggered by a key-press-event or enter-notify-event signal.  \
Havoc informs me that it refers to the button-release-event button, but I'm still \
struggling to see its purpose.

The fifth parameter could permanently be $event-&gt;time(); as far as I can see ....  

menu-&gt;popup();  would be a lot more straightforward to use if we could lose the first \
2 parameters, set the callback position array to be automatically generated somehow \
from any input other than 'null', lose parameter 4, and maybe (I dunno) lose \
parameter 5 as well ...

Comments, anyone?  Patches?

i have seen same result at least twice.

my system is:
suse 7.3
kernel 2.4.18-pre1
gtk 1.2.10
php-4.1.1
php-gtk-0.5.0

i guess this is happened inside expose_event on drawingarea object.
to repeat segfault is easy: i have created large drawingarea (1600x1600) 
with simple redraw logic
and moved whole window by mouse quickly, causing expose_event occure 
very fast.

what other info should i provide ?

sorry for my english

Hi all,

This time I'd like to use the GtkScintilla widget on windows.
I develop on linux, but I'd like to write a multi-platform program.

I think it's not too hard to compile a php_gtk_scintilla.dll and
sintilla.dll &amp; scilexer.dll. You have to compile the gtk version
of scintilla, and make a '.dsp' for the scintilla extension, and compile
it.

I think theoretically this should be done, but I can't set up a compile
environment on windows...

Could anyone help me, please!

Thanks,
Doma

Here's a couple questions, maybe someone can answer one (or both!) of
these:

1] It seems that one has *no* control over scrollbars whatsoever -- it
   appears to be impossible to make a scrollbar scroll up or down without
   the user dragging on it.

   Is there *any* way I can force a scrollbar to go to the bottom without
   the user having to click it?

   Failing that, is there a way to make it so a GtkText's scrollbar will
   follow outputted data?  My GtkText box is for data output only, so it
   never has keyboard focus -- I need it, so when text is inserted into
   it, it will automatically scroll to the bottom.


2] Currently, my application involves a GtkTable, 16x16, of 32x32 pixmaps.
   I will often be updating this entire screen, rather than just one or
   two pixmaps.  During certain large updates -- most noticably, along the
   diagonal -- the entire pixmap area will appear to "flicker".

   Is there anything like GtkText's freeze() and thaw() methods for
   pixmaps?  Because if I could somehow make Gtk wait until I've made
   all my updates *then* display them, I believe the flicker would be
   avoided -- since I think it's trying to update *during* my while loop
   to place new tiles, I believe that's what's causing the flicker.

   ... If I can't do that, I'll probably end up writing it such that I
   combine all the tiles into one big pixmap before displaying them on
   the screen, which will be a bit of a pain but I believe that will
   avoid the flicker.


Anyway ... if anyone has insight, please let me know!


Steve

	I've discovered if I run gtk::main_iteration_do(0); with each tile
update, there is no noticable flicker.  So this isn't a problem anymore.
However, I'm still looking for a way to have control over my scroll bars
:-)

Its probably worth contacting the scintilla interest mailing list 
(www.scintilla.org), they may have some thoughts on it. my guess is that 
you would need MS Visual C++, and cygwin.

I did spend some time looking at it, but never got very far, my 
understanding of Visual C++ is very limited..

http://www.micampe.it/software/moleskine/  (who did the bindings for 
gtk) may be able to offer suggestions.

 From my recollection there was a myrid of different combinations to 
compile gtk apps on windows, ranging from cygwin, mingw and VC++.

once you get gtkscintilla working, the php binding should be realively 
easy (just copy,paste+edit from one of the other php-gtk directories)

&gt;Hi all,

&gt;This time I'd like to use the GtkScintilla widget on windows.
&gt;I develop on linux, but I'd like to write a multi-platform program.
&gt;
&gt;I think it's not too hard to compile a php_gtk_scintilla.dll and
&gt;sintilla.dll &amp; scilexer.dll. You have to compile the gtk version
&gt;of scintilla, and make a '.dsp' for the scintilla extension, and compile
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;I think theoretically this should be done, but I can't set up a compile
&gt;environment on windows...
&gt;
&gt;Could anyone help me, please!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Hello,

What is the minimum PHP version to build PHP-GTK?

In the PHP-Mole IDE page it says it is version 4.0.5 but it does not 
seem to be the case.

Hi all (Frank),

I downloaded the new versions of everything today (gtk+, libiconv, glib,
gettext) and am back where I started - 72 compile warnings and only a
static lib produced.  Fiddling with gwin32.h hasn't helped lose the
warnings and I'm baffled as to where libiconv and gettext come into it
at all ..

My old version builds fine against CVS PHP, it's just the new build env
I'm struggling with.  Seem to remember having a lot of trouble with this
last time too.

Can we please sort a step-by-step way of setting up the build
environment cleanly from scratch and add it to the README and manual
this time?  -  it'll save having to keep asking :)

Cheers,
Steph

Hi All (Steph),

The quick steps are:

1) Download the packages
gtk+-dev-1.3.0-20020912.zip
glib-dev-2.0.6-20020802.zip
libiconv-1.8-w32-1.bin.zip
gettext-dev-0.10.40-20020904.zip
libglade-0.17.tar.gz

2) Extract these to a src directory some where on yor system. (I only
extraced the files I needed and I'll be happy to provide you with a single
zip file ?)

3) You will have to build libglade yourselfs (I have created a makefile
for this)

4) Configure visual studio to have include-path and lib-path to all the
libraries (these are no longer hard coded in the project files)

5) Compile and link :-)

too late, I re-wrote the .dsp and it works now :) although it still
compiles with 72 warnings, or which 70 are glib issues.

I still haven't figured why it needs libiconv .. I know it's necessary
to build glib, but not needed here shorely?

dnd now works as advertised, however I get an err msg:
&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt;:  Undefined variable:  argv in
&lt;b&gt;C:\php\php-gtk\test\gtk.php&lt;/b
on line &lt;b&gt;2661&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

technically it was about 4.0.5 (I think the &amp; thing started working

It was in your phpmole instructions page but it seems you already found it.

Actually it was complaining of missing TSRM symbols, not really in PHP

Anyway, I was just looking forward to use phpmole as interface to APD.

I tried to build PHP-GTK 0.51 with PHP 4.2.3 and it complained about

I use gtkhtml updated with the Ximian Red Carpet and I am using SuSE 
Linux. Since these packages are installed automatically, I don't want to 
mess with gtkhtml installations to not break other applications.

Is this a problem in PHP-GTK build? Shall I report it as a bug?

did you say you had gtkscintilla.dll - the other ones look like they are 
dll's from pure scintilla (without the gtk wrapper)??

theres actually 2 parts to gtk'ing scintilla

scintilla the editor uses gtk/gdk or windows widgets to draw/render the 
window and do popups etc.
(this is 'raw' scintilla www.scintilla.org)

the gtkscintilla wraps the widget so that it has the same API as any 
other gtk widget, eg. it sends gtk signals, and
has a gtk_scinitlla_new() function, and all the methods map to an 
object'like model..
this is the gtkscintilla - from moleskine.

If you got that far - its probably worth bugging frank directly AFAIK 
hes one of the few that has successfully built php-gtk on windows :)

Is that php from CVS?

            $this-&gt;array[] = 1;

fixes it as well -
I suspect ive I've seen that before as well..

Moste of these warnings are related to double to float convertions. I do
have a small fix for these, but I have not had the time to figure out why
these was changed in the first place.

I changed the build process so the .dsp files would not depend on where
you installed header and lib files from gtk+, Though you woule have to
configure your compiler environment with these.

- Frank

&gt; too late, I re-wrote the .dsp and it works now :) although it still
&gt; compiles with 72 warnings, or which 70 are glib issues.
&gt; 
&gt; I still haven't figured why it needs libiconv .. I know it's necessary
&gt; to build glib, but not needed here shorely?
&gt; 
&gt; dnd now works as advertised, however I get an err msg:
&gt; &lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt;:  Undefined variable:  argv in
&gt; &lt;b&gt;C:\php\php-gtk\test\gtk.php&lt;/b

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi All (Steph),
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The quick steps are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Download the packages
&gt; &gt; gtk+-dev-1.3.0-20020912.zip
&gt; &gt; glib-dev-2.0.6-20020802.zip
&gt; &gt; libiconv-1.8-w32-1.bin.zip
&gt; &gt; gettext-dev-0.10.40-20020904.zip
&gt; &gt; libglade-0.17.tar.gz
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Extract these to a src directory some where on yor system. (I only
&gt; &gt; extraced the files I needed and I'll be happy to provide you with a
&gt; single
&gt; &gt; zip file ?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) You will have to build libglade yourselfs (I have created a
&gt; makefile
&gt; &gt; for this)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4) Configure visual studio to have include-path and lib-path to all
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; libraries (these are no longer hard coded in the project files)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5) Compile and link :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Frank
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all (Frank),
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I downloaded the new versions of everything today (gtk+, libiconv,
&gt; &gt; glib,
&gt; &gt; &gt; gettext) and am back where I started - 72 compile warnings and only
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; static lib produced.  Fiddling with gwin32.h hasn't helped lose the
&gt; &gt; &gt; warnings and I'm baffled as to where libiconv and gettext come into
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; at all ..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My old version builds fine against CVS PHP, it's just the new build
&gt; env
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm struggling with.  Seem to remember having a lot of trouble with
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; last time too.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can we please sort a step-by-step way of setting up the build
&gt; &gt; &gt; environment cleanly from scratch and add it to the README and
manual
&gt; &gt; &gt; this time?  -  it'll save having to keep asking :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Steph

the page below where he explains how to use themes with Gimp. I sincerely

is...ehm...ugly, in my opinion of course.

Hi, I'm trying to make a new widget for PHP-GTK,I do this:

[root@localhost ext]# ./ext_skel --widget=gtkgraph
Creating directory gtkgraph
Creating skeleton files
cp: no se puede efectuar `stat' sobre `.cvsignore': No existe el fichero

Can't open .cvsignore: No existe el fichero o el directorio.
Can't open .cvsignore: No existe el fichero o el directorio.
Can't open .cvsignore: No existe el fichero o el directorio.

Now you can create your gtkgraph/gtkgraph.defs file with:

        ../generator/h2def.py &lt;path&gt;/gtkgraph.h &gt;gtkgraph/gtkgraph.defs

and don't forget to add the constructor line to gtkgraph.defs:

        (is-constructor-of Gtkgtkgraph)

in the definition of gtk_gtkgraph_new

Them when I put:

[root@localhost ext]# ../generator/h2def.py /root/cgtk/widget/gtkgraph.h
&gt;gtkgraph/gtkgraph.defs
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "../generator/h2def.py", line 345, in ?

    buf = define_func(buf, fp)
  File "../generator/h2def.py", line 231, in define_func
    args=arg_split_pat.split(args,', ')
TypeError: an integer is required


And I the script don't write all code of the gtkgraph.defs and
gtkgraph.overrides . What can I do? Help me please. Thanks a lot.

Hey people, i've discovered i new way to install PHP-GTK on windows, =
it's work perfectelly, i think someone else test and see if it's work =
i'll put it in the manual too.
Follow these steps.

1. get the lastet binary version at gtk.php.net;
2. extract and copy all of the files inside winnt/system32 and the file =
php.ini to php4 folder;
3. rename test folder to samples folder, and move it to php4 folder;
4. put your php4 folder at your system driver disk (i.e. c:/);
5. type this command-line at the command prompt (dos):
cd c:\php4&lt;enter&gt;
php4 -q -c c:\php4\php.ini -f c:\php4\samples\gtk.php

i'm using gtk.php because the hello.php file is wrong programmed.

Hi Steph,

fopen is a basic php command so it should still work.

Are you using the win32 version ?

If that is the case you might want to download the latest php-cgi.exe, and then \
everything should work as before. The new CLI version of php.exe does not work \
exactly as the CGI version did.

You can download the latest binaries from http://kromann.info/php4.php

- Frank

&gt; I have some fopen()s that don't work, and did prior to this release.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues, anyone?

Hi Steph,

I have noticed the same behavior with the CLI version.
It seems that the filesystem functions are buggy....
Using php-cgi.exe solved it!

Bye

I think Andreis the only one who has tested with latest CVS of both, I 
know that php4.2.1 is ok with php-gtkCVS.

I'll see if I can try it later next week..

HEy there;

I've found a bug, dunno if it's PHP or PHP GTK but when I brought it up on
the IRC channel last night I was asked to post here.

This line of code will cause PHP to seg fault when run:

$tilesPix[0]=gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm_d($tilewindow-&gt;$window,null,$blankTile32by32xpm);


The PHP parser SHOULD pick up an error -- namely, it *SHOULD* be
$tilewindow-&gt;window  INSTEAD of $tilewindow-&gt;$window   -- but instead of
giving a parse error, PHP seg faults.  This line of code works 100% as:

$tilesPix[0]=gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm_d($tilewindow-&gt;window,null,$blankTile32by32xpm);

I am trying to extend the GtkMenuBar object so that I can add an array of 
values to a menu.

For example.

======  CLASS CODE ======

&lt;?php
class GtkMenuBarExt extends GtkMenuBar{
     function fill_from_array($items){
         if (!is_array($items)){
         return false;
         }

         foreach ($items as $menu_name =&gt; $menu_array){
         $menu =&amp; new GtkMenu();
             foreach ($menu_array as $item_name =&gt; $item_label){
             $item =&amp; new GtkMenuItem($item_label);
             $item-&gt;show();
             $menu-&gt;append($item);
             }
         $menu-&gt;show();
         parent::add($menu);
         }
     }
}
?&gt;


====== MAIN SCRIPT ========

$menubar =&amp; new GtkMenuBarExt();
$menu_items = Array("file" =&gt; Array("new" =&gt; "New", "save" =&gt; "Save"), 
"help" =&gt; Array("help_contents" =&gt; "Help", "about" =&gt; "About..."));
$menubar-&gt;fill_from_array($menu_items);
$menubar-&gt;show();

//// pack this into the window etc

==========================

I have tried everything, but the menu doesn't seem to have the array items 
added.  Am I losing a reference somewhere, or is this something php-gtk 
can't do?

Subject: Re: [PHP-GTK-DEV] Scrollbars and flickers oh my!


&gt; &gt; 2] Currently, my application involves a GtkTable, 16x16, of 32x32 pixmaps.
&gt; &gt; I will often be updating this entire screen, rather than just one or
&gt; &gt; two pixmaps.  During certain large updates -- most noticably, along the
&gt; &gt; diagonal -- the entire pixmap area will appear to "flicker".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there anything like GtkText's freeze() and thaw() methods for
&gt; &gt; pixmaps?  Because if I could somehow make Gtk wait until I've made
&gt; &gt; all my updates *then* display them, I believe the flicker would be
&gt; &gt; avoided -- since I think it's trying to update *during* my while loop
&gt; &gt; to place new tiles, I believe that's what's causing the flicker.
&gt; 
&gt; I've discovered if I run gtk::main_iteration_do(0); with each tile
&gt; update, there is no noticable flicker.  So this isn't a problem anymore.
&gt; However, I'm still looking for a way to have control over my scroll bars
&gt; &gt; -)

hi All,

I have been off the list for some time now, but I'm back. I'll put this on my todo \
list, and I think it is possible to get this working. I did play with it some time \
ago, but ran into some problems. That was before the change in the build system, and \
IIRC these changes might have fixed the problems I had.

- Frank

&gt; Its probably worth contacting the scintilla interest mailing list 
&gt; (www.scintilla.org), they may have some thoughts on it. my guess is that 
&gt; you would need MS Visual C++, and cygwin.
&gt; 
&gt; I did spend some time looking at it, but never got very far, my 
&gt; understanding of Visual C++ is very limited..
&gt; 
&gt; Frank may be able to help/comment, otherwise your other helplines 
&gt; include the gtk-windows mailing lists (cant remember the location of 
&gt; that one), &lt;mailto:micampe%28@%29micampe.it&gt; Michele Campeotto 
&gt; http://www.micampe.it/software/moleskine/  (who did the bindings for 
&gt; gtk) may be able to offer suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; From my recollection there was a myrid of different combinations to 
&gt; compile gtk apps on windows, ranging from cygwin, mingw and VC++.
&gt; 
&gt; once you get gtkscintilla working, the php binding should be realively 
&gt; easy (just copy,paste+edit from one of the other php-gtk directories)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This time I'd like to use the GtkScintilla widget on windows.
&gt; &gt; I develop on linux, but I'd like to write a multi-platform program.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think it's not too hard to compile a php_gtk_scintilla.dll and
&gt; &gt; sintilla.dll &amp; scilexer.dll. You have to compile the gtk version

&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think theoretically this should be done, but I can't set up a compile

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; You not only need php_printer.dll you need a version compiled from the same source \
&gt; as the rest of your php installation. You can always find new binaries at \
&gt; http://kromann.info/php4.php. These binaries are compiled from the same snapshot, \
&gt; and will work together.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; php_printer.dll needed according to the usernotes...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,... I am on win32.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I downloaded PHP-GTK windows binary from gtk.php.net. And phpversion() =
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.2.0-dev.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently found printer functions that were added in php 4.0.4 or greater
&gt; &gt; &gt; but they do not work with php-gtk windows binary... What can I do??
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.printer.php

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think those functions would be pretty useful to anyone working in win32..

I have written a small application to load glade files and insert their 
contents into a notebook in my main application window.

To do this i create a glade file as normal, then edit the glade file 
manually, removing the header (project directory etc) and the main window 
widget (so that the glade file only contains the top level widget, a GtkBox 
or Table) I name the top level widget app_main.

I then load this file into my application like this...

function load_app($appname, $label_text='New App'){
     $appgx =&amp; new GladeXML("glx/$appname/$appname.glade");
     $app = $appgx-&gt;get_widget('app_main');
     $label =&amp; new GtkLabel($label_text);
     $this-&gt;nb-&gt;prepend_page($app, $label);
     $this-&gt;nb-&gt;set_page(0);
     unset($appgx);
     unset($app);
     }

This works as expected the first time, but crashes the second time round, 
where it should load another application into a new notebook tab.  I have 
tested it using 2 (hacked) glade files and it still produces the error on 
the second time, which ever file i load in.

Please contact me directly and I can send you a zip with the files needed.

Hey thats good, you found the second known bug with glade on windows, 
you cant load the same glade file twice...(or sometimes glade files with 
similars ?????somethings????? in)...
I think it was fixed in later versions of libglade , but Im not sure if 
a dll was ever made with this fix.

anyway thats why I gave up and wrote the glade emulator..

    It would be new to me that the PHP binary windows build is
    something special on its own.

    It's only the PHP-GTK module which of course doesn't make
    sense when run under a webserver (don't load it in your
    php.ini).

    Frank, is there anything special with the PHP binary itself
    apart the PHP-GTK module?

    If not, I don't see any reason why not use the same PHP
    binary for two different things (though in the future the use
    of CGI is deprecated for PHP-GTK and CLI is the recommended
    one).

&gt; 
&gt; in the php-gtk docs it's clearly stated that php-gtk is NOT meant to be used
&gt; in a webserver, so it's quite clear that one MUST have two php versions if one
&gt; wants to use php for those different things.
&gt; 
&gt; on unix it's not different, as one uses the apache module version for web use
&gt; and the cgi version for php-gtk.
&gt; 
&gt; there's no other choice, if you want you can try to code a php versions for
&gt; windows that can do both atv the same time, but i guess if that was so easy no
&gt; one had made the work to create a special php version only for php-gtk.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, as this seems obviously no bug at all we're on the wrong list to
&gt; discuss that.

Okay, I tracked down the problem and fixed it. It should now work for
file, pipe, and socket resources in all PHP versions.

Hi Andrei,

Let me know when, and I'll create a package with the Win32 stuff.

I have been trying to compile libglade-0.17 under windows, but so far without \
success. If I manage to get it working I'll include that as well.

- Frank

&gt; I intend to package and release 0.5.1 or something like that in the next
&gt; couple of days. Speak up if you have something to say.

&lt;input type=hidden name=action value="Actualiser les pri"&gt;


i made a little example
that you can find in this mail

ok, so install the version from php.net so taht your webserver uses it and use
the gtk version for gtk progs _only_

i am not sure, but i can think that the php binaries that come with the gtk
distro aren't supposed to be run within a webserver.

I want cordinated bug system somehow...
(e.g. I would like to use single interface to keep track bug
report for PHP and PCEL extension. I mainly work on PHP source
but have 4 PECL extensions to manage)

Having different bug tracking system is ok, but all users
are better to enter bug report from bugs.php.net. Click
appropriate link from there or guide users with wizard
like interface?

(I wish we can use single bug tracking system...)

sorry, i don't understand what you want.

in the php-gtk docs it's clearly stated that php-gtk is NOT meant to be used
in a webserver, so it's quite clear that one MUST have two php versions if one
wants to use php for those different things.

on unix it's not different, as one uses the apache module version for web use
and the cgi version for php-gtk.

there's no other choice, if you want you can try to code a php versions for
windows that can do both atv the same time, but i guess if that was so easy no
one had made the work to create a special php version only for php-gtk.

anyway, as this seems obviously no bug at all we're on the wrong list to
discuss that.

The last would be useful for documentation, except that several of the signals used in GTK are used for bindings only and are not available for external use - testing them's the bane of my life currently ;) 

Andrei's on vacation at present, so it may be a while before you get a reasoned response to this.

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] signals &amp; other todo


&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a new fan of php-gtk, and I want to help in development, especially
&gt; implementing those functions &amp; features, which I need to my new php-gtk
&gt; programs.
&gt; 
&gt; For example: it would be great, if you can query the signal names for a
&gt; class which you can connect to. I have to ideas:
&gt; 1. implementing the gtk_signal_query &amp; the klass-&gt;signals and
&gt; klass-&gt;nsignals properties of GtkObject
&gt; 2. adding signal names to the def files (get from the gtk docs)
&gt; 
&gt; The second will be useful for the php-gtk documentation too.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think about it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Doma
&gt;

There was a performance hit when I was shoving the data into the clist
and in my test script to check the memory I did also see a performance
hit, but then I'm running this on a celeron 600.

Noticable yes, drastic no. the the cgi version is  fast, very fast, I like it so. 
The CLI version I'd very much like to see handle memory like this given that 
the scripts will be running for a very long time (barring crashes :) or even
allow me to deallocate when I need to

&gt; &gt; &gt;     is of course only php-gtk related).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;     I was playing with idea bringing this to other members of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;     developer community that it may be wise to have the CLI

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    shifting this from the php-gtk list to the dev list, basically what I've got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    is allocating variables and then using unset to free them doesn't do anything,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    memory still remains allocated, setting the fast cache off gets this working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    however unset'ing gui widgets doesn't do anything.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    PHP 4.1.1 with the php-gtk at 0.5, I'm loading about 26k rows into a clist and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    then when I've got what I need out of it I unset it and the memory remains 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    allocated...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, my cgi module is still intact, thats on a production server, the commandline
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; version did see a performance hit when I was allocating the array without the fast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cache enabled, though normally I'd not go do something silly like roll 26k records
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into an array I might have to do that sooner or later. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was trying some work based on your intro doc which is what got me into the idea of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the php-gtk interface. Nice examples you've got up, very helpfull.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This works quite fine, however an unset on a gui widget does do this, I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recompiled php-gtk 0.5.0.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Possible it just not implemented...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Anyway .. if this is true for memory allocation, can we say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     something about performance loss if you change this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     behaviour?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Why I'm asking is simply exmplained: php in apache and php on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     command line are two different worlds. On apache side, it may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     be a good idea not to release memory. However, from my point
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     of view it makes very much sense for the CLI version of PHP
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     and maybe we should raise this to php-dev@ to discuss certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     things about this aspect there.

Notices referring to GTK_TYPE_POINTER occur when a signal is used that passes a \
pointer as a parameter, on some systems (I've seen them on w2k).  PHP doesn't deal \
with that type.  Not a clue why that should have made your app unstable, unless it's \
an indication that you were generating signals you were unaware of?

Franks's only made it possible to use libglade with PHP, not written the thing for \
win32.  Don't blame the poor man!

&gt; I fighted with this behavior a few days ago and found
&gt; out, that if You build a naked notebook with Glade
&gt; this error does not occur. The bad message is, that
&gt; many notices belonging to GTK_TYPE_POINTER
&gt; will be shown (Error_reporting E_All). This made made
&gt; my app very unstable with strange effects. Only the manually
&gt; building of the damned notebook was a solution. But I have
&gt; only one notebook in my app and You have many of them......
&gt; 
&gt; The hint from Alan (Thank You Alan!), with his glade emulation
&gt; wrapper doesn't work on my machine under win and I have to find
&gt; out why. The nested widgets will not be shown correctly and
&gt; several errors are displayed. I will have a look inside this class
&gt; because it fixes the never-load-a-glade-file-twice error which
&gt; is also a problem under win.
&gt; 
&gt; Could it be possibly a problem of the Win port of libglade?
&gt; Frank Kromann does it, maybe he can say a word to this
&gt; problems?

Hi!


&gt; The last would be useful for documentation, except that several of the
&gt; signals used in GTK are used for bindings only and are not available
&gt; for external use - testing them's the bane of my life currently ;) 
&gt; 
I see it's already in the docs, so maybe I'll not put it into the
defs...


&gt; Andrei's on vacation at present, so it may be a while before you get
&gt; a reasoned response to this.
Andrei, are you back?


Gtk+ 2.0 is now out. What do you think about using it?


bye,
Doma

&gt; 
&gt; Well, I'd at least wait until 2.0.1 comes out. Never know what they are

&gt; 
&gt; And then I'd like to combine Gtk+ 2.0 with ZE2 -- it would be a lot
&gt; better that way. ZE2 needs to stabilize a bit though.

i think that reproducing error whould be easier on a slower hardware,

i have duron 800 &amp; geforce-256, and it takes &lt; 1 minute to repeat error.

Hi,

I'm a new fan of php-gtk, and I want to help in development, especially
implementing those functions &amp; features, which I need to my new php-gtk
programs.

For example: it would be great, if you can query the signal names for a
class which you can connect to. I have to ideas:
1. implementing the gtk_signal_query &amp; the klass-&gt;signals and
klass-&gt;nsignals properties of GtkObject
2. adding signal names to the def files (get from the gtk docs)

The second will be useful for the php-gtk documentation too.

What do you think about it?


thanks,
Doma

Hi All,

   shifting this from the php-gtk list to the dev list, basically what I've got
   is allocating variables and then using unset to free them doesn't do anything,
   memory still remains allocated, setting the fast cache off gets this working
   however unset'ing gui widgets doesn't do anything.

   PHP 4.1.1 with the php-gtk at 0.5, I'm loading about 26k rows into a clist and
   then when I've got what I need out of it I unset it and the memory remains 
   allocated...

   This applies to the other widgets I use aswell

brett

&gt; Yes, my cgi module is still intact, thats on a production server, the commandline
&gt; version did see a performance hit when I was allocating the array without the fast
&gt; cache enabled, though normally I'd not go do something silly like roll 26k records
&gt; into an array I might have to do that sooner or later. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was trying some work based on your intro doc which is what got me into the idea of
&gt; the php-gtk interface. Nice examples you've got up, very helpfull.
&gt; 
&gt; Lemme subscribe to the php-dev list and raise this issue

mmm yes, just been off playing with an as/400 (shudder), mind blank..

I don't quite understand why php-dev, if php itself is deallocating the stuff
when I disable the fast cache and when I unset a gui widget it doesn't surely then
it relates to php-gtk's code not calling the free?

sorry if that sounds newbieish, i need way more coffee today

&gt; I don't quite understand why php-dev, if php itself is deallocating the stuff
&gt; when I disable the fast cache and when I unset a gui widget it doesn't surely then
&gt; it relates to php-gtk's code not calling the free?
&gt; 
&gt; sorry if that sounds newbieish, i need way more coffee today

    In fact, I was only talking about the memory behaviour with
    the normal CLI version and left out the widget thing (which
    is of course only php-gtk related).

    I was playing with idea bringing this to other members of the
    developer community that it may be wise to have the CLI
    version by default release the memory once unset if it suits
    performance-wise.

    Yes, I'ld like to hear others opinions on the CLI issue too.

    One more thing: I'm not quite sure if I got you right the
    last time, how were the results of the modification with
    instant-memory-release performance-wise? Was it noticeable
    slower with large memory juggling or not?

 Michele, let me know he has moved the gtkscintilla onto sourceforge and 
released v.0.8.1 - includes all the mods i did + a few other small ones.

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=31426

the bottom one is _required_ to build php-gtk with it, the top one is 
just a fix for an old bug, that enables folding to work correctly.

There are few other very little changes, none seem particularly 
important, and if somebody has the time they could look at

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/moleskine/gtkscintilla/scintilla/include/Scintilla.iface.diff?r1=1.1&amp;r2=1.2


to get an idea of the other changes.

the only snag now is that there is no current version of scintilla that 
builds correctly with php-gtk.....

any votes for 0.5.1 (unix only) - as it shouldnt affect the windows 
version...

regards
alan

Andrei : do you want to give me karma on scintilla? - funny 
http://pear.php.net/account-info.php?handle=alan_k says I dont have

Sure. Done.

Commit your patches and let me know if it's possible to build PHP-GTK
out of the box with any version of Scintilla. Put a README file in
ext/scintilla if necessary.

That was just my hack to get folding working (it wasnt supposed to be an 
official version)- It's gone now that Michele has moved everything to 
sourceforge. - the problem was that michele - the official maintainer of 
gtkscintilla hadnt updated his site in about 5 months or something.. - 
so gtkscintilla contained a few bugs and was a little outdated (from the 
core scintilla project) - so I fixed a few bugs and updated them, and 
waited for michele to update his site.. - which happened about 3 weeks 
after..

One of the problems we have with the update is that scintilla is also 
available packaged = eg. redhat mandrake, etc. - Now if you use the old 
version with the new code it breaks, and visa versa.. - basically I need 
to work out a fix for this.. - which may have to be a nasty #ifdef in 
the overrides file..

&gt;
&gt;Should php-gtk be changed or it's ok now and GtkScintilla should be

Andrei,

&gt; i have continued investigations.
&gt; first, i have recompiled glib &amp; gtk to include debug info (-g3) into 
&gt; shared libraries.
&gt; i played with my script a whole day, and got three different types of 
&gt; backtraces:


It sounds like a symptom of some sort of memory leak. However, I am not
able to get it to crash at all, which makes debugging practically
impossible.

&gt; i have reinstalled php-4.1.1 and php-gtk-0.5.0 from scratch several
&gt; times.
&gt; i have tried this on 2 different computers (suse 7.1 &amp; suse 7.3) and the 
&gt; result was as described above.

I use RedHat 7.1/7.2 (on two different machines). Perhaps, this happens
only on SuSE? Are you able to test under some other distribution of
Linux? Maybe someone else on this list can confirm this crash?

-Andrei

Sh**t happens :)

I guess I'll have to wait. When (if ever) will there be a new libglade 
release for win32?

&gt; Ok, after many hours of testing!
&gt;
&gt; It appears that the released version of libglade for win32 has a bug

&gt;
&gt; http://www.daa.com.au/pipermail/pygtk/2001-August/001529.html
&gt;
&gt; It also appears that libglade::xml_new_from_memory() does not work - 
&gt; which would have been the alternative method.
&gt;
&gt; at present - I cant see any way around this bug, other than rewriting 
&gt; the glade loader in php :(
&gt;
&gt; so I guess the win32 version will have to wait a little while :(

I think it can be usefull for Windows users, like me. 

You can found a copy at:

Hi 

This page
http://www.akbkhome.com/Projects/phpmole-IDE/Download%20and%20Installation
describes a fix for php-gtk 0.5 and GtkScintilla 0.8 (which was released
long time before php-gtk 0.5).

Should php-gtk be changed or it's ok now and GtkScintilla should be
updated?

thanks

&gt; i think that reproducing error whould be easier on a slower hardware, 
&gt; beacuse this is mainly screen refresh issue.
&gt; 
&gt; i have duron 800 &amp; geforce-256, and it takes &lt; 1 minute to repeat error. 
&gt; today i found another method: not to moving window self, but moving any 
&gt; other window over.
&gt; 
&gt; oh, i forget:
&gt; i use gdk-pixbuf v0.11.0

I have downloaded your script, ran it and quickly moved the window
around for 40 seconds or so -- no problems at all. I have Celeron 533Mhz
with Voodoo 3 card. Moving other windows over it was fine too.

This was using the CVS version of PHP-GTK which has not really changed
since 0.5.0 release.

It would be great if you could isolate this problem in a more easily
reproducible environment.

Thanks,

-Andrei

Ok, after many hours of testing!

It appears that the released version of libglade for win32 has a bug 
that stops it loading the same glade file twice

http://www.daa.com.au/pipermail/pygtk/2001-August/001529.html

It also appears that libglade::xml_new_from_memory() does not work - 
which would have been the alternative method.

at present - I cant see any way around this bug, other than rewriting 
the glade loader in php :(

so I guess the win32 version will have to wait a little while :(

&gt;Hi Alan,
&gt;
&gt;Ok, heres what I got:
&gt;
&gt;1. Logged in -&gt; ok 
&gt;
&gt;2. Tried to edit a snippet -&gt; crash.
&gt;
&gt;3. Tried to open one topictree -&gt; down some levels, tried to open an article. -&gt;
&gt;chrash.
&gt;&lt;! getting more systematic now, 
&gt;4. Opened group tree -&gt; tried to rightclick on myself -&gt; chrash.
&gt;
&gt;5. Tried the other parts with the same result: when I try to access a leaf
&gt;object mole segfaults.
&gt;For each one I get this:

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Now, It seems to me that the line over has too many : in it. Should they be
&gt;there?
&gt;
&gt;Also: theres no _ under the V in view in the menuline on top.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps a bit :)

&gt;&gt;i think that reproducing error whould be easier on a slower hardware,

Morning, sir

i have continued investigations.
first, i have recompiled glib &amp; gtk to include debug info (-g3) into 
shared libraries.
i played with my script a whole day, and got three different types of 
backtraces:


/* this one is caused by (timer event ?) */

sometimes i saw these errors and warnings (instead of segfault)
all where refered to last line of these code blocks:

     $SpritesArray-&gt;render_to_drawable($widget-&gt;window,
         $widget-&gt;style-&gt;fg_gc[GTK_STATE_NORMAL],
         $sp_x, $sp_y,
         $px, $py,

and

                         Warning:  draw_rectangle() expects argument 2

finally, i tried to patch zend sources, and got "BUG!" instead of segfault:

i have reinstalled php-4.1.1 and php-gtk-0.5.0 from scratch several times.
i have tried this on 2 different computers (suse 7.1 &amp; suse 7.3) and the 
result was as described above.


as i'm newbie with zend api, have no idea where should i dig to.



hope you will find this info useful.

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] gtk_menu_popup


I've just spent about a week trying to make sense of this.

Andrei already did something to it so it will only accept 5 parameters (user_data \
doesn't seem to get accepted unless I'm doing some bad thing to it).

The first two parameters should always be null for a popup menu.  They are there \
because they are used internally to associate a popup with a menubar or optionmenu \
(because there is NO SUCH THING AS A DROPDOWN GTKMENU).

The third parameter refers to another callback function which needs to return an \
array of co-ordinates (x, y).  It can be null, and if so there is a default in place \
for it (the menu pops up at the pointer position).

The fourth parameter does nothing, even in the depths of GTK code, and really \
shouldn't be there at all as it refers to mouse-button options in a callback which \
could equally well be triggered by a key-press-event or enter-notify-event signal.  \
Havoc informs me that it refers to the button-release-event button, but I'm still \
struggling to see its purpose.

The fifth parameter could permanently be $event-&gt;time(); as far as I can see ....  

menu-&gt;popup();  would be a lot more straightforward to use if we could lose the first \
2 parameters, set the callback position array to be automatically generated somehow \
from any input other than 'null', lose parameter 4, and maybe (I dunno) lose \
parameter 5 as well ...

Comments, anyone?  Patches?

If you have lots (let's say 100 or 200) of functions() in PHP does this
slow everything down a lot? How is the interal working of a function?

returns the height of the widget in mm, bear in mind that containers don't take up \

algebra :-(

I can't make get_arg() work either, I think maybe I'm missing something somewhere?

One more thing, I am looking for some good technical documentation on how to use

Help in any one of these two places would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

All,

I will be preparing the CVS tree for 0.5 release. If you have any
objections or comments, let me know (copy me on the email, I am not
subscribed to the list currently).

One thing that will need to be documented is the new .ini setting called
"php-gtk.extensions" which lets you load shared PHP-GTK extensions. Like
this:

php-gtk.extensions = php_gtk_libglade.so, php_gtk_gdkpixbuf.so

The process of configuring extensions should also be documented. It
would be great if someone could take on that task.

&gt; &gt; &gt;testing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ok, this was really a superficial quicktest only. i've downloaded php 
&gt; &gt; 4.1.1, compiled it with --prefix=/usr/local/php-cgi/4.1.1 only. then got 
&gt; &gt; php-gtk 0.5.0 and configured like this:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php-gtk/0.5.0 --disable-libglade 
&gt; &gt; --with-php-config=/usr/local/php-cgi/4.1.1/bin/php-config
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (have no libglade...)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; make, make install ... without a hitch.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; then i started the tutorial script from my hp - not a heavy one, only 
&gt; &gt; some buttons, a text field and a CList - worked without a problem.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; then i started test/gtk.php - maybe there are some issues, i am not 
&gt; &gt; sure. here is what i saw:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - the second test, "buttons": if i click a button, another one 
&gt; &gt; disappears - i guess that is intended?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - 4. test, CList: wether or not you activate "reorderable", it is always 
&gt; &gt; reorderable. if i drag a clist item on my desktop (KDE), php-gtk says:
&gt; &gt; "Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkselection.c: line 908 (gtk_selection_request): 
&gt; &gt; assertion `(data.format &gt;= 8) &amp;&amp; (data.format % 8 == 0)' failed."
&gt; &gt; finally, the button "undo selection" does do anything.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - 6. test, CTree: again, the tree is always reorderble, and again the 
&gt; &gt; same error is caused if i drag something on the desktop. ah, now i see: 
&gt; &gt; if i deactivate "reorderable", i cannot no longer drag items, same for 
&gt; &gt; clist!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - 9. test, dragndrop: interesting - if here i drag the button on the 
&gt; &gt; desktop, no error is caused. err, in the second i wrote that sentence 
&gt; &gt; before, one of the books from test no. 6 that i dragged on the desktop 
&gt; &gt; flew over my screen...  magic..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - 14 test, label: the very last sentence that reads "this one is 
&gt; &gt; underlines in quite a funky fashion" has some strange symbols (like 
&gt; &gt; russian letters) in front "quite"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - last test, tooltips: the second button has a long tooltip that is 
&gt; &gt; correctly wrapped, but not wrapped at all and therefore not completely 
&gt; &gt; visible beneath the button "tooltip inspector" if activated via the 
&gt; &gt; tooltip inspector.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thats all, sorry i have no time for more. if tomorrow i have time i 
&gt; &gt; install libglade and try php-gtk 0.5.0 with phpmole, that seems to be 
&gt; &gt; the most complex php-gtk app currently around.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; nevertheless, my true respect for you, andrei!
&gt; 
&gt; I think these are all okay. I'll be making a releasing late tonight.

I've uploaded php-gtk-0.5.0.tar.gz to the server. It's not publicly
released yet - I'd like you to download it and give it a once over

extensions as shared and testing them. Heck, we need some QA.

It should be there in 10 minutes or so.

Any plans for the inclusion of a canvas object on which other objects
can be drawn, dragged and dropped?

Can't you just use GdkFont::extents()? (see php_gtk+_types.c).

On Mon, 28 Jan 2002, Steph Fox wrote:
&gt; gdk::text_width() takes the GdkFont, the string, and the strlen($string) as \

&gt; We don't have that, or gdk::string_width(), or gdk::char_width().  Any or all would \

&gt; Any chance?

anyway -answer=yes, timeline=?????

You can drag and drop stuff between any widget to any other widget, I 
use the clist to drag and drop images into the gtkhtml editor here

I'm writing an ISAPI interface for our web server to be used with PHP 4.xx

When I request a PHP file, any php file, this is returned to the caller:

Warning: Failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='\winbbs') in

I know this is a zend error message, I just don't know what I'm doing wrong
to cause it.

Below is a debug dump of what was sent to the PHP ISAPI DLL.

If nothing is shown after the - 
it contains an empty string.

Could someone please look at this and tell me what I'm doing wrong.

Well I asked some time ago but I was told that it was waiting for
something related with Gnome 2 if I got it right.

I would not like to spend time trying to make something else work like
what I need which is a simple drawing container canvas on which I can
layout other objects (widgets not just images) arbitrarily inside it and
the users can drag and drop those objects wherever they want.

Couldn't this be achived already with some base class that is supported
by PHP-Gtk?

php.ini needs doctoring as per Andrei's eariler instructions.  Perhaps as well to put 

php-gtk.extensions = php_gtk_libglade.dll, php_gtk_sqpane.dll

directly into the version distributed with for win32?

Hi,

ok, this was really a superficial quicktest only. i've downloaded php 
4.1.1, compiled it with --prefix=/usr/local/php-cgi/4.1.1 only. then got 
php-gtk 0.5.0 and configured like this:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php-gtk/0.5.0 --disable-libglade 
--with-php-config=/usr/local/php-cgi/4.1.1/bin/php-config

(have no libglade...)


make, make install ... without a hitch.

then i started the tutorial script from my hp - not a heavy one, only 
some buttons, a text field and a CList - worked without a problem.

then i started test/gtk.php - maybe there are some issues, i am not 
sure. here is what i saw:

- the second test, "buttons": if i click a button, another one 
disappears - i guess that is intended?

- 4. test, CList: wether or not you activate "reorderable", it is always 
reorderable. if i drag a clist item on my desktop (KDE), php-gtk says:
"Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkselection.c: line 908 (gtk_selection_request): 
assertion `(data.format &gt;= 8) &amp;&amp; (data.format % 8 == 0)' failed."
finally, the button "undo selection" does do anything.

- 6. test, CTree: again, the tree is always reorderble, and again the 
same error is caused if i drag something on the desktop. ah, now i see: 
if i deactivate "reorderable", i cannot no longer drag items, same for 
clist!

- 9. test, dragndrop: interesting - if here i drag the button on the 
desktop, no error is caused. err, in the second i wrote that sentence 
before, one of the books from test no. 6 that i dragged on the desktop 
flew over my screen...  magic..

- 14 test, label: the very last sentence that reads "this one is 
underlines in quite a funky fashion" has some strange symbols (like 
russian letters) in front "quite"

- last test, tooltips: the second button has a long tooltip that is 
correctly wrapped, but not wrapped at all and therefore not completely 
visible beneath the button "tooltip inspector" if activated via the 
tooltip inspector.


thats all, sorry i have no time for more. if tomorrow i have time i 
install libglade and try php-gtk 0.5.0 with phpmole, that seems to be 
the most complex php-gtk app currently around.


nevertheless, my true respect for you, andrei!

gdk::text_width() takes the GdkFont, the string, and the strlen($string) =
as arguments.  It returns the width of the string in pixels.

We don't have that, or gdk::string_width(), or gdk::char_width().  Any =
or all would be useful.

Any chance?

I found the key binding in gtkmenu.c for up/down/right/left, so that's that part of \
it explained away.  The fact of the error message remains valid.

I'm going to concentrate on not finding bugs for a little while now while you all \
recuperate from Christmas/New Year :)

Sorry chaps, but I'm getting that self-same error when the 'move-current' signal is \
emitted too.  I can only get this signal to fire *at all* using arrow keys, which is \
weird cos it's not bound to keys (the other signal was).

Test script below because I'm due back at work in 5 minutes and don't want to fight \
with attachments not working ;)  Please could someone run it on *nix and say whether \
the program aborts when running through the 'File' menu with arrow keys there too?

- scuse scrappiness, I've used the same couple of scripts for all menushell function \
and signal testing so they're all over the place - oh and ps, if anyone can figure \
what the smeg 'move-current' signal is *supposed* to do and when it's meant to fire, \
I'll buy them sweeties :)

on the dos screen I got
'Test' was selected from the menu.

I achieved this by running:

I get the same result with return key or spacebar.

The function is no big deal:
