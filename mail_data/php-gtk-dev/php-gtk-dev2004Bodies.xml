 ID:               28587
 User updated by:  jbelton at shaw dot ca
-Summary:          Default Color has Little Square Dots Everywhere
 Reported By:      jbelton at shaw dot ca
 Status:           Open
 Bug Type:         PHP-GTK related
 Operating System: Windows 98
 PHP Version:      1.0.0 (PHP-GTK)
 New Comment:

Determined that this is not a problem if the display mode is set to
32-bit color rather than 16-bit.  Unfortunately, some Windows software
doesn't work in 32-bit, so this is still a problem.

Couldn't the default be just plain grey?  This seems to be the default
for every other windows app.  Having a default of "psychosis inducing
graph paper" that requires developers to figure out how to install and
modify the default theme doesn't seem like a great way to win over the
windows development community.  But what do I know, I'm a Linux
developer &gt;;)

This is not a bug, that is the color of the GTK interface, if you try
to use the GTK themes your interface change

Recategorizing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2004-05-31 06:29:20] jbelton at shaw dot ca

Description:
------------
Just installed PHP-GTK 1.0.0 on Windows 98.  Don't know the version of
PHP.  Downloaded the hello world script below.  Works fine, but the
default "color" is light grey, covered with dark grey dots.  Also
downloaded a longer sample program.  Again, works fine but with little
grey dots all over it.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php

if (!class_exists('gtk')) {
    if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0,3) == 'WIN'))
    dl('php_gtk.dll');
  else
    dl('php_gtk.so');
}

function delete_event()
{
    return false;
}

function shutdown()
{
    print("Shutting down...\n");
    gtk::main_quit();
}

function hello()
{
    global $window;
    print "Hello World!\n";
    $window-&gt;destroy();
}

$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'shutdown');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$window-&gt;set_border_width(10);

$button = &amp;new GtkButton('Hello World!');
$button-&gt;connect('clicked', 'hello');
$window-&gt;add($button);

$window-&gt;show_all();

gtk::main();

?&gt;


Expected result:
----------------
A little window with a button saying hello world, but without little
dark grey spots all over it.

Actual result:
--------------
Could send a screen shot,

&gt; Subject: Re: [PHP-GTK] what is going on with gtk.php.net?
&gt;
&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; I would like to make a few comments and raise a few questions
&gt; PHP is a software enabling access to a function reference base base 
&gt; organised by groups.
&gt; Ex. Database : MySQL, PgSQL, Oracle
&gt;  
&gt; As far as I know there is no stand alone php mysql project
&gt; Why PHP GTK would be one ?
&gt; Why shouldn’t we think of a wrapper system that would run with GTK1, 
&gt; 2, Cocoa, Carbon and maybe Windows UI ?
&gt; Why shouldn’t we call this project PHP-UI ?
&gt; Indeed I have been working for six months on a wrapper system, up to 
&gt; now, I have drawn what would be necessary to make it
&gt; My point is not to discuss what has been done up to now, I just think 
&gt; that PHP could have a bigger impact on final developpers. In addition, 
&gt; it would make doc creation easier
&gt;
&gt; I may be wrong but I am open to comments
&gt; If you find it fine, I will dedicate some time to work on this subject.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; -mike

&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, seems like not many people are with me on this. The ants
&gt;&gt;&gt; anology is good, but like ants I think people will tend to leave
&gt;&gt;&gt; the not so sweet parts. Anyway this post has generated a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic so there's obviously a lot of interest in the issue. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think the idea of a cenrally managed effort is a good one, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; you may be right about it not getting used. Bit sad really as you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can see the good Sun have done on the documentation for Java (a
&gt;&gt;&gt; rival of PHP-GTK????). I'll start thinking about what I can do
&gt;&gt;&gt; this weekend and stop pestering this list with my rantings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm not saying throw away the present manual there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of useful information there. But the old saying goes "Too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many cooks spoil the broth.". What I'm saying is that central
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; management of the documentation is needed to be effective, i.e.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you look at this widget and document all \ or many of its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties, methods ect according to these guidlines \ standards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formal methods, or whatever. This work could then be submitted to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a project leader(s) for review which would then be passed back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for corrections or included into the manual. I'm sure, like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself, many have busy lives but if we work with common aims on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this I think it can be done. Having people randomly work on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sections will not produce a coherant manual - central management
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and review is the key.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Getting any material at all would be pretty key from where I'm 
&gt;&gt;&gt; standing :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The more complex the process, the less likely you are to see anyone 
&gt;&gt;&gt; going
&gt;&gt;&gt; through with it.  'Having people randomly work on sections' is 
&gt;&gt;&gt; _exactly_
&gt;&gt;&gt; what the php.net manual guys do; OSS documentation, like OSS
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything else,
&gt;&gt;&gt; is better demonstrated by watching a nest-ful of ants retrieve a
&gt;&gt;&gt; teaspoonful
&gt;&gt;&gt; of sugar than by anything else I can think of.  There's already 
&gt;&gt;&gt; control
&gt;&gt;&gt; there, in the form of other users, in the form of user notes, and in 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; form of peer review (quite a few people have CVS karma for the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; manual, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; most of them are translators rather than initiators).  It's much 
&gt;&gt;&gt; easier to
&gt;&gt;&gt; get information corrected than it is to get information there in the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt; place; witness this list, and the amount of flak the PHP-GTK
&gt;&gt;&gt; manual's taken
&gt;&gt;&gt; over the years for incompleteness, versus the amount of people who 
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed original material to it.  It's always easier to criticise
&gt;&gt;&gt; existing work than it is to produce any.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; At php.net nowadays, the docs team request that new functionality 
&gt;&gt;&gt; (and new
&gt;&gt;&gt; extensions) are initially documented by the person that wrote that
&gt;&gt;&gt; functionality or extension.  This isn't an option we have here; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrei's
&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed a couple of classes to the manual (and it took him a lot 
&gt;&gt;&gt; less
&gt;&gt;&gt; time than it would've taken me), but we can hardly ask him to
&gt;&gt;&gt; document 100+
&gt;&gt;&gt; classes in his spare time. Even if he had any.  He automated what he 
&gt;&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt;&gt; and left the rest for people to fill in.  In other words, at present 
&gt;&gt;&gt; -
&gt;&gt;&gt; still - if there are no signals and no properties outlined in a 
&gt;&gt;&gt; PHP-GTK
&gt;&gt;&gt; class, it's safe to say that that class has never been touched by 
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; writing documentation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I should maybe make the secondary point that the GTK+ 1.2.* project 
&gt;&gt;&gt; itself
&gt;&gt;&gt; had the same documentation problems we face here.  That manual was 
&gt;&gt;&gt; never
&gt;&gt;&gt; completed either.  The documentation for GTK 2 is similarly 
&gt;&gt;&gt; generated but
&gt;&gt;&gt; was better thought through, with the developers getting involved to
&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce new concepts.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm blathering.  Sorry :)  but all this stuff does need thinking 
&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt; before anyone goes to the trouble of setting up an environment that 
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't
&gt;&gt;&gt; get used, or a second manual, or anything along similar lines.

Hello,

I'm trying to get php-gtk working on a debian linux system and am having 
some
trouble. I'm using:

machine:~$ gtk-config --version
1.2.10

and:

machine:~$ php --version
PHP 4.3.9RC2 (cgi) (built: Sep  1 2004 15:12:50)

I've downloaded the 1.0.0 source tar.gz from the website, and when I try to
run buildconf, I get the following:

machine:~/php-gtk-1.0.0$ ./buildconf
configure.in:9: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_WITH_PHP_CONFIG
  run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
  or see 
http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending%20aclocal
configure.in:32: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_BUILDDIR
configure.in:33: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_DIR

configure.in:35: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_ALWAYS_SHARED
aclocal: cannot open php_gtk.m4: No such file or directory
make: *** [buildmk.stamp] Error 1

So I looked around and I see php_gtk_new.m4 and php_gtk_old.m4. Being 
optimistic,
I coped php_gtk_new.m4 to php_gtk.m4 and buildconf then completed 
successfully
in spite of about 100 "underquoted definition of" warning messages. Then 
I did
./configure and that completed also. The make starts off fine, but then 
blows up
part way through with this:

looking at the file ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c I see that the first 4 lines are
as follows:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fopen(--): failed to open stream: No such file or 
directory in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fgets(): supplied argument is not a valid stream 
resource in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on 
line &lt;b&gt;34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

which is of course not valid C code. These errors are, I believe, coming 
from the
Defs_Parser constructor (in generator/scheme.php) which is being called from
generator/generator.php, which is being executed directly from the 
Makefiles in
many places with "--" as the first argument. I was hoping perhaps 
someone could
point me at the root of the problem. Thanks very much!

Hi folks,

When working on a new WinBinder demo (http://winbinder.sourceforge.net/), I 
found out that php_win.exe for PHP 4 (from PHP-GTK) crashes when called from 
a folder with spaces. For example, c:\PHP\myapp\php_win.exe runs fine, but 
c:\Program Files\myapp\php_win.exe consistently crashes. This can be a 
problem for Windows users since the applications path typically has a space.

More specifically, php.exe (AppVer: 4.3.9.9) crashes php4ts.dll at offset 
000BB8E4 with code 0xC0000005 (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION). I'm using the 
files from php-gtk-1.0.1a-win32.zip.

Interestingly, php.exe always runs perfectly, even on a directory with 
spaces (although it opens a DOS box, of course). Also, PHP 5 does not have 
this problem -- but in this case I'm using the file php-win.exe and the 
others that come with it.

Does anybody knows how to find (or build) a version of php_win.exe that 
won't crash in this situation?

Many thanks in advance,

Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] php_win.exe crashes when in a directory with spaces


&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt; When working on a new WinBinder demo (http://winbinder.sourceforge.net/),
I
&gt; found out that php_win.exe for PHP 4 (from PHP-GTK) crashes when called
from
&gt; a folder with spaces. For example, c:\PHP\myapp\php_win.exe runs fine, but
&gt; c:\Program Files\myapp\php_win.exe consistently crashes. This can be a
&gt; problem for Windows users since the applications path typically has a
space.
&gt;
&gt; More specifically, php.exe (AppVer: 4.3.9.9) crashes php4ts.dll at offset
&gt; 000BB8E4 with code 0xC0000005 (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION). I'm using the
&gt; files from php-gtk-1.0.1a-win32.zip.
&gt;
&gt; Interestingly, php.exe always runs perfectly, even on a directory with
&gt; spaces (although it opens a DOS box, of course). Also, PHP 5 does not have
&gt; this problem -- but in this case I'm using the file php-win.exe and the
&gt; others that come with it.
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody knows how to find (or build) a version of php_win.exe that
&gt; won't crash in this situation?
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks in advance,

Hi Steph,

I believe I forgot to mention that I have the same problem with all 
versions available for download either through the website or cvs. I 
just tried it again with 1.0.1 to verify and it is indeed the exact same 
problem (minus the missing php_gtk.m4 that I mentioned). Any other ideas?

Thanks!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm trying to get php-gtk working on a debian linux system and am having
&gt;&gt;some
&gt;&gt;trouble. I'm using:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;machine:~$ gtk-config --version
&gt;&gt;1.2.10
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;and:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;machine:~$ php --version
&gt;&gt;PHP 4.3.9RC2 (cgi) (built: Sep  1 2004 15:12:50)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've downloaded the 1.0.0 source tar.gz from the website, and
&gt;&gt;when I try to
&gt;&gt;run buildconf, I get the following:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;machine:~/php-gtk-1.0.0$ ./buildconf
&gt;&gt;configure.in:9: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_WITH_PHP_CONFIG
&gt;&gt;  run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
&gt;&gt;  or see
&gt;&gt;http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending%20aclocal
&gt;&gt;configure.in:32: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_BUILDDIR
&gt;&gt;configure.in:33: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_DIR

&gt;&gt;aclocal: cannot open php_gtk.m4: No such file or directory
&gt;&gt;make: *** [buildmk.stamp] Error 1
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So I looked around and I see php_gtk_new.m4 and php_gtk_old.m4. Being
&gt;&gt;optimistic,
&gt;&gt;I coped php_gtk_new.m4 to php_gtk.m4 and buildconf then completed
&gt;&gt;successfully
&gt;&gt;in spite of about 100 "underquoted definition of" warning messages. Then
&gt;&gt;I did
&gt;&gt;./configure and that completed also. The make starts off fine, but then
&gt;&gt;blows up
&gt;&gt;part way through with this:
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;looking at the file ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c I see that the first 4 lines are
&gt;&gt;as follows:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fopen(--): failed to open stream: No such file or
&gt;&gt;directory in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on

&gt;&gt;line &lt;b&gt;34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;which is of course not valid C code. These errors are, I believe, coming
&gt;&gt;from the
&gt;&gt;Defs_Parser constructor (in generator/scheme.php) which is being
&gt;&gt;called from
&gt;&gt;generator/generator.php, which is being executed directly from the
&gt;&gt;Makefiles in
&gt;&gt;many places with "--" as the first argument. I was hoping perhaps
&gt;&gt;someone could
&gt;&gt;point me at the root of the problem. Thanks very much!

Hi


&gt; I saw that append_item is in gtk.defs, but I can't use it from php... I 
&gt; assume there is no chance for it?
I've digged around in the gtk sources and have one conclusion:
With the missing of "insert_element" and "insert_item", the GtkToolbar 
is only half as usable as it should be. E.g. the automatical creation of 
  toolbar items with icons and callbacks is not possible.

Now I don't know if I should make a php function which emulates the 
complete insert_element behavior, or just note in the manual that it 
really really long winded to use the toolbar?

I can take a look at what it would take to implement those methods.

Hi

Some might know that there are several MessageBox classes for php-gtk 
flouncing around the web. I think mine was the first one, Alan adopted 
it for one of his projects, Nathan did another one...

I think it's time to get a PEAR msgbox, and I'm currently collecting 
ideas for the class
- Must display text, title and icon :)
- Enable different buttons, with some standard ones being hardcoded (Ok, 
Yes/No, Yes/No/Cancel, Abort/Retry/Ignore, ....) but keep the option to 
define own ones
- Default selected button
- Standard icons should be provided: Question, Information, Error, Warning
- A "don't ask/show this any more" checkbox would be nice
- One-line call: No need to instantiate something, just call "$nAnswer = 
Gtk_MessageBox( 'hello', 'test);"


Now the things I'm pondering with:
- The java message box classes have the option for a text entry box 
(JOptionPane.showInputDialog). Would this fit in the class, or should 
that be a different one?
- RTL/LTR support (icon on the left or right side), is there a setting 
in a standard location which could be read easily (php config or so)
- Icons: Have four icons vs. Have four icons for every operating system 
(windows icons are very different from gtk/kde ones). What to implement?
- Make text alignment options sense? (left/center/right)
- How to pass the parameters? In VC++, you have three params: Text, 
title and options with "options" being a sum of options (int). My 
current implementation uses this, but somebody indicated some years ago 
that that's too C'ish. But how to pass a number of parameters in a 
really easy way?
- How to return the "don't ask/show this any more" setting - the pressed 
button has to be returned as well. Array makes no sense, as one had to 
expect an array always - equals if the "don't ask" feature is used. It 
would be possible to return an int if no "don't ask" is used, and an 
array with "button" and "dontask" values if it's used. Is that good 
style? Don't really think so.
- Are int values ok for standard button returns? My current class uses 
constants like IDYES, IDNO and IDCANCEL.
- If text input is ok, how to pass the inputted text back? array? 
(selected button has to be returned as well)
- Is it allowed in PEAR to have functions outside a class?

I think Abort/retry/ignore can be left out, it's a relict from my Visual 
C++ times...

I don't have GTK 2 source handy on this box - check it, I'm 99.99% certain
there's a widget in there for this...

Just don't want to see you spending time on a PEAR project that's only valid
for PHP-GTK 1 and then releasing it the same week Andrei releases PHP-GTK 2,
y'know?

Hi gang,

I am at point in working on generator where we need to figure out how
constructors should function. I have 2 issues to discuss.

Gtk2 allows for a property based constructor invocation, something like:

  GtkAlignment *align = (GtkAlignment *)g_object_newv(GTK_TYPE_ALIGNMENT,
"xalign", 1.0, "yalign", 0.0, "xscale", 0.5, NULL);

The old style was:

  GtkAlignment *align = gtk_alignment_new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

PyGtk has utilized this to make generation of constructors easier. The
properties are defined in the .defs file, the generator parses them and
generates property based constructor that can be invoked as:

  align = gtk.GtkAlign(xalign = 1.0, yalign = 0.0, xscale = 0.5)

 or something like that.

The old style of constructors is not deprecated, so it's still possible to
invoke it as:

  align = gtk.GtkAlign(1.0, 0.0, 0.5);

So, in our case, should we just stick with how PHP-GTK1 constructors worked
or should we try to allow pseudo-keyword invokation?

  $align = new GtkAlignment(array('xalign' =&gt; 1.0, 'yalign' =&gt; 0.0, 'xscale'
=&gt; 0.5));

The second question is what should we do if constructor encounters an error.
In PHP-GTK 1 we invalidated $this variable (setting it to NULL), but in
PHP-GTK 2 I am tempted to raise an exception.

Hi Andrei


&gt; Hi gang,
Never been part of such thing, and proud to be now!

&gt; So, in our case, should we just stick with how PHP-GTK1 constructors worked
&gt; or should we try to allow pseudo-keyword invokation?
&gt; 
&gt;   $align = new GtkAlignment(array('xalign' =&gt; 1.0, 'yalign' =&gt; 0.0, 'xscale'
&gt; =&gt; 0.5));

I see only one problem: What if a constructor really needs only an array 
of, lets say titles as first parameter? How to distinguish between 
normal an option-based invocation?
This could be solved by assuming that with one parameter, it always has 
to be option-based invoc, but that would break BC.
If that would be no problem, then I think it is a nice-to-have.

&gt; The second question is what should we do if constructor encounters an error.
&gt; In PHP-GTK 1 we invalidated $this variable (setting it to NULL), but in
&gt; PHP-GTK 2 I am tempted to raise an exception.
That would be the oo way. Java does the same AFAIK. +1 from me.
Just now there is the problem that old program would run even if one 
assignment failed, here you'd need to catch the exceptions or the prog dies.



PS: Andrei, just something for the 
"the-doc-people-would-like-to-have-it" list:
It would help very very very much if there would be a glade function 
which connects all signals defined in the glade to functions of an 
OBJECT. In php-gtk1 there are only functions which connect the signals 
assigned to functions in the glade file to objectless functions - that's 
not very oo.

 The PHP-GTK websites says

   "The forthcoming PHP-GTK version 2.0 will bind GTK+ 2 to PHP 5."

 I was under the impression that PHP-GTK 2 development takes place in CVS
 HEAD.

 The issue at hand is autoconf / automake related and not a problem with
 PHP 4 or PHP 5.

just a short "Here is what's going on" type of message. It could point 
out some new applications, like Christian's manual browser, or some new 
code, like Christian's pear class or any other high quality stuff that 
people have written/seen recently. Maybe it could also include a short 
message from Andrei on the state of version 2.

If you look at the homepage, it looks like there were tons of things 
going on over the summer but nothing has changed since then.

Just an idea.

Thanks,
Scott

Great idea, Scott. Go ahead and put one together - not sure if you want
Ben to post it actually or want to do it yourself. You'll also need to
update the .rss script.

As far as my progress, I'm still hacking away on the generator. I think
it should be functional within a week or two, so you'll have basic
methods and functions to call, but there is still a fair amount of work
to be done.

Alright. I don't know if I have the karma to update the site but here is 
a rough draft for a news item:

While work continues on &lt;a 
href="http://gtk.php.net/wiki/PhpGtk/Php-Gtk2"&gt;PHP-GTK 2&lt;/a&gt;, there has 
been some big news with PHP-GTK 1. The continuing documentation efforts 
have produced &lt;a href="http://gtk.php.net/manual/en/tutorials.php"&gt;two 
new tutorials&lt;/a&gt; and lots of new doc pages. To go along with all of the 
new docuemtion, Christian Weiske has released &lt;a 
href="http://www.cweiske.de/phpgtk_coders.htm#manualbrowser"&gt;manualBrowser&lt;/a&gt;, 
a PHP-GTK application to make it easier to read the docs offline. The 
folks over at PEAR have even jumped on the PHP-GTK bandwagon. There are 
two new &lt;a 
href="http://pear.php.net/packages.php?catpid=34&amp;catname=Gtk+Components"&gt;gtk 
classes&lt;/a&gt; and a new PHP-GTK interface for PHPUnit.


I can't think of a good heading. Does anbody have anything to add/change?

Unless anyone has any last minute changes, I think we should put it up. 
It still needs a heading of some kind. Something like "News from the

As far as I know, the install process for PHP-Gtk2 shouldn't be any 
different than the process for version 1 
(http://gtk.php.net/manual/en/installunix.php) but PHP-Gtk2 is a work in 
progress. I don't think it is compilable quite yet. It probably isn't an 
autoconf issue but really a "it just ain't ready yet" issue.

The property-based constructors are meant only for simple values. A
constructor such as GtkClist one will surely be overriden by a custom
implementation.

&gt; If that would be no problem, then I think it is a nice-to-have.

If it's just nice-to-have, I am not sure I want to invest time it right
now. I'll just go ahead and implement positional parameters first.

&gt; That would be the oo way. Java does the same AFAIK. +1 from me.
&gt; Just now there is the problem that old program would run even if one 
&gt; assignment failed, here you'd need to catch the exceptions or the prog dies.

Right. Before we had warnings, but I think failure to create an object
is serious enough.

&gt; PS: Andrei, just something for the 
&gt; "the-doc-people-would-like-to-have-it" list:
&gt; It would help very very very much if there would be a glade function 
&gt; which connects all signals defined in the glade to functions of an 
&gt; OBJECT. In php-gtk1 there are only functions which connect the signals 
&gt; assigned to functions in the glade file to objectless functions - that's 
&gt; not very oo.

Sure, I'll see what's possible, but that's after main stuff is
implemented in PHP-GTK 2.

Yes, I thought I've seen such a thing.

Does it still make sense to release PEAR Gtk packages for PHP-Gtk 1.x?

I think that depends on how long PHP-Gtk 1.x will still be used. I think 
if there is a valid reason to use 1.x after the release of 2.x then sure 
it makes sense because people using the 1.x branch won't have this 
functionality. If there isn't a valid reason to use it after 2.x has 
been released, then it depends on how long it will take to get to a 
stable 2.x release. I think Anrdei said on IRC the other day that he 
expects a first release of 2.x in two to three months. A PEAR class 
takes at least 2 weeks to get accepted after the code is written so your 
class wouldn't be out there very long before it gets made obsolete by 2.0.

I think your idea is great but the timing is off just a little. I don't 
know of any reason to keep using 1.x after the release of 2.0 and I 
think 2.0 will come out too soon for your class to be widely used and 
excepted. I do think that this would make a great article/tutorial on 
extending PHP-Gtk for code reusability though. It would be nice to see 
something on how to make PHP-Gtk easier to user rather than another 
article on creating an address book.

Christian,

I have finished implementing all the append/prepend/insert_item/element
methods of GtkToolbar. They are committed to CVS on PHP_GTK_1 branch.
Let me know if they work for you okay.

I didn't see any crashes. GtkToolbar::set_style() should properly

No, you didn't understand me.
The gtk function gtk_toolbar_set_style has nothing to do with GtkStyles, 
it determines if the toolbar is set to both/text only/icon only mode.
When I add some buttons with both text and icons I should have the 
ability to determine if only text is shown or that only icons are wanted.
Try this:

&lt;?php
if( !extension_loaded('gtk')) {	
	dl( 'php_gtk.' . PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);
}

$window	= &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_title( 'toolbar test');
$window-&gt;set_default_size( 400, 70);
$window-&gt;connect_object('destroy', array('gtk', 'main_quit'));

$systemimage = array(
'13 13 5 2',
'  c None s None',
'. c topShadowColor m white c lightblue',
'X s iconColor1 m black c black',
'o s bottomShadowColor m black c #646464646464',
'O s selectColor m white c red',
"                          ",
"          . . .           ",
"      . . X X X o o       ",
"    . X X X X X X X o     ",
"    . X X X X X X X o     ",
"  . X X X X O X X X X o   ",
"  . X X X O O O X X X o   ",
"  . X X X X O X X X X o   ",
"    . X X X X X X X o     ",
"    . X X X X X X X o     ",
"      o o X X X o o       ",
"          o o o           ",
"                          "
);
$window-&gt;realize();
list($pixmap, $mask) = Gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm_d($window-&gt;window, 
null, $systemimage);
$pixmapwid = &amp;new GtkPixmap($pixmap, $mask);

//$toolbar = &amp;new GtkToolbar( GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH);
$toolbar = &amp;new GtkToolbar( GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT);
//$toolbar = &amp;new GtkToolbar( GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, 
GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS);

$toolbar-&gt;append_item( 'new', 'Creates a new document', null, 
$pixmapwid, 'toolbarClicked', 'new' );

$window-&gt;add( $toolbar);
$window-&gt;show_all();

gtk::main();
?&gt;

There are some commented lines which create a toolbar with different 
*toolbar styles*. Even that there is only one button which is created by 
the toolbar itself and has an icon - always both text and icon is shown.

Now call me dumb if I didn't understand it right:
The set_style of GtkToolbar should set this *toolbar style*, or is there 
another method?
I originally meant that, if the method/function names are converted as 
usual, that the "gtk_toolbar_set_style" is renamed to "set_style" and so 
overrides the original set_style function which deals with GtkStyles. 
That's what I called "crash", sorry for my bad english.
So I thought the following should work:
$toolbar-&gt;set_style( GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS);
which doesn't, or I am missing something.

It may be that both things (constructor and set_style) don't have 
anything in common on this problem, but it could be I think.

Hi

&gt; I think you meant "clash".
Yes, that's a good word describing my thought.


&gt;&gt;So I thought the following should work:
&gt;&gt;$toolbar-&gt;set_style( GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS);
&gt;&gt;which doesn't, or I am missing something.
&gt; It works for me. Try the attached script. Does it work for you?
It works when called from the callback function, but it does not work 
when I set the style in the constructor or out of the callback function

&gt;&gt; I would like to make a few comments and raise a few questions
&gt;&gt; PHP is a software enabling access to a function reference base base 
&gt;&gt; organised by groups.
&gt;&gt; Ex. Database : MySQL, PgSQL, Oracle
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; As far as I know there is no stand alone php mysql project
&gt;&gt; Why PHP GTK would be one ?
Probably due to the scale  of the project (mysql has ~20 functions, gtk 
has &gt; 900)

Merging that kind of documentation into the main manual would not be a 
good idea..


&gt;&gt; Why shouldn’t we think of a wrapper system that would run with GTK1, 
&gt;&gt; 2, Cocoa, Carbon and maybe Windows UI ?
GTK2 is supposted to be that wrapper system, there are backends for 
Coca/Win32 etc.
The only other significant candidate for this is wxWindows.


&gt;&gt; Why shouldn’t we call this project PHP-UI ?
&gt;&gt; Indeed I have been working for six months on a wrapper system, up to 
&gt;&gt; now, I have drawn what would be necessary to make it
&gt;&gt; My point is not to discuss what has been done up to now, I just think 
&gt;&gt; that PHP could have a bigger impact on final developpers. In addition, 
&gt;&gt; it would make doc creation easier

I've looked at this a number of times, The main reason to use GTK is 
that it is by far the easiest to write bindings for (it was actually 
part of the design goal). KDE / wxWindows / Gecko's UI stuff, are all 
written in C++ and are pretty difficult to write bindings to in comparison.

There was a limited working GTK2/PHP5 branch in CVS, I'm certian it 
doesnt build with current PHP5, but It probably would not take too much 
to fix.

The brick wall we ran into before was
$gtkobject-&gt;style['BG_COLOR'] = new GtkColor('#ffcccc');
the dereferencing of arrays in the PHP5 objects was not working when I 
stopped working on it.

Regards
Alan

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I may be wrong but I am open to comments
&gt;&gt; If you find it fine, I will dedicate some time to work on this subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, seems like not many people are with me on this. The ants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anology is good, but like ants I think people will tend to leave
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the not so sweet parts. Anyway this post has generated a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic so there's obviously a lot of interest in the issue. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think the idea of a cenrally managed effort is a good one, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you may be right about it not getting used. Bit sad really as you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can see the good Sun have done on the documentation for Java (a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rival of PHP-GTK????). I'll start thinking about what I can do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this weekend and stop pestering this list with my rantings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm not saying throw away the present manual there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of useful information there. But the old saying goes "Too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many cooks spoil the broth.". What I'm saying is that central
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; management of the documentation is needed to be effective, i.e.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you look at this widget and document all \ or many of its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties, methods ect according to these guidlines \ standards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formal methods, or whatever. This work could then be submitted to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a project leader(s) for review which would then be passed back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for corrections or included into the manual. I'm sure, like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself, many have busy lives but if we work with common aims on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this I think it can be done. Having people randomly work on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sections will not produce a coherant manual - central management
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and review is the key.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Getting any material at all would be pretty key from where I'm 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The more complex the process, the less likely you are to see anyone 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through with it.  'Having people randomly work on sections' is 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _exactly_
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the php.net manual guys do; OSS documentation, like OSS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything else,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is better demonstrated by watching a nest-ful of ants retrieve a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teaspoonful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of sugar than by anything else I can think of.  There's already control
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there, in the form of other users, in the form of user notes, and in 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form of peer review (quite a few people have CVS karma for the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manual, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most of them are translators rather than initiators).  It's much 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easier to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get information corrected than it is to get information there in the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place; witness this list, and the amount of flak the PHP-GTK
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manual's taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over the years for incompleteness, versus the amount of people who have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed original material to it.  It's always easier to criticise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existing work than it is to produce any.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At php.net nowadays, the docs team request that new functionality 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extensions) are initially documented by the person that wrote that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functionality or extension.  This isn't an option we have here; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrei's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed a couple of classes to the manual (and it took him a lot 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; less
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time than it would've taken me), but we can hardly ask him to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; document 100+
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; classes in his spare time. Even if he had any.  He automated what he 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and left the rest for people to fill in.  In other words, at present -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still - if there are no signals and no properties outlined in a PHP-GTK
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class, it's safe to say that that class has never been touched by 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing documentation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I should maybe make the secondary point that the GTK+ 1.2.* project 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had the same documentation problems we face here.  That manual was 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completed either.  The documentation for GTK 2 is similarly 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generated but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was better thought through, with the developers getting involved to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce new concepts.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm blathering.  Sorry :)  but all this stuff does need thinking about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before anyone goes to the trouble of setting up an environment that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get used, or a second manual, or anything along similar lines.

Hello Alan,

just got back from my winter holiday, that's why it's taken me so long
to answer your mail:)

&gt; did you want to get cvs karma and commit this? ???

Yes, it would be nice if either me or someone else could commit this. 
As far as I see, it's the same function prototype in GTK2 (defined
in /usr/X11R6/include/gtk-2.0/gdk/gdkwindow.h on my system) and can be
accomplished in the same way.

I can make a new patch against CVS head (from looking at different CVS
status outputs, I guess the PHP5 + GTK2 related code would need to be
committed against CVS head?) and send it to the list. Before that, I'll
have to fight buildconf and make it generate ./configure:) At the
moment, it's telling me:

thekid@friebes:~/devel/php/gtk/php-gtk &gt; ./buildconf 
autoconf: Undefined macros:

Stop in /usr/home/thekid/devel/php/gtk/php-gtk.

Any hints on that?

Don't worry about PHP5 + GTK2 for now. Those functions just might be
auto-generated in the end.

php-config isn't the problem, it's where it should be. If configure was
outputting this message, it'd be simple:)

The actual problem is that autoconf is complaining about "Undefined
macros":

# autoconf 2.13, the default, called by buildconf:
thekid@friebes:~/devel/php/gtk/php-gtk &gt; autoconf
autoconf: Undefined macros:

configure.in:22: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use

      See the Autoconf documentation.
configure:2960: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0
configure:3074: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_GTK_2_0

I'll try to figure out what's causing this...

Yes. It will promote usage of PHP-GTK and it shouldn't be too hard to
port it to PHP-GTK 2.

Hi Andrei,


&gt; The property-based constructors are meant only for simple values. A
&gt; constructor such as GtkClist one will surely be overriden by a custom
&gt; implementation.
I thought *all* constructors would have it then. If not, it's not 
consistent, and I to my mind inconsistency should be avoided as far as 
possible.

&gt; If it's just nice-to-have, I am not sure I want to invest time it right
&gt; now. I'll just go ahead and implement positional parameters first.
Positional has priority, I think. People are used to it.

&gt; Right. Before we had warnings, but I think failure to create an object
&gt; is serious enough.
ACK.

&gt; The next week I'll get all the packages needed to compile this and then
&gt; I 'll try to run this under win32... I dont't know the issues I should
&gt; face to get it working -just if its possible with the actual sources-
&gt; but will give it a try anyway...

Dude, don't expect much. It barely constructs some classes and runs some
methods. No signals, no properties, none of the fancy.. what the heck, none
of the everyday stuff either.

Hi all,

I'm a newbie in php but not in wxWidgets (from www.wxWidgets.org) and I
think you can be interest in cross-platform development with a
cross-platform langage because wxWidgets is wx_GTK, wx_MSW, wx_OS2, wx_MAC,
wxMozilla, wx_Unix, wx_Python and so on..
Give me your best idea about this!! Thanks in advance.
Best regards.

Yes, wxWindows would provide native look and feel in several platforms 
unlike GTk.

However, I think that would be subject of a whole new extension because 
it does not seem to be much in common with GTk and wxWindows.

Hi all,

&gt; The best extension - IMHO - was ".phpw", the "windowed php application".
&gt; Other suggestions were to have a context menu entry for opening the 
&gt; whole thing in the console, but as an addition to the console-less default.

So, today I discovered "php-tk", an extension which allows you to create 
windowed php applications with tcl/tk. All of you who didn't believe 
that there would be another windowing extension for php - here you see 
that ".phpgtk" is not suitable for graphical php apps. ".phpw" is more 
convient to tell the user that it's with windows, indifferent of the 
underlying extension.

Simon,

The problem is not with the PHP file name. It is *the executable* itself 
that can't be placed in a directory with spaces. The shortcut:

"C:\Program Files\WinBinder\php-win.exe" ttfreader.phpw

has quotes, but php_win.exe crashes.

Thanks,

&gt; Have you tried enclosing the path in quotes ? e.g.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When working on a new WinBinder demo (http://winbinder.sourceforge.net/),
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; found out that php_win.exe for PHP 4 (from PHP-GTK) crashes when called
&gt; from
&gt;&gt; a folder with spaces. For example, c:\PHP\myapp\php_win.exe runs fine, 
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; c:\Program Files\myapp\php_win.exe consistently crashes. This can be a
&gt;&gt; problem for Windows users since the applications path typically has a
&gt; space.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; More specifically, php.exe (AppVer: 4.3.9.9) crashes php4ts.dll at offset
&gt;&gt; 000BB8E4 with code 0xC0000005 (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION). I'm using the
&gt;&gt; files from php-gtk-1.0.1a-win32.zip.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Interestingly, php.exe always runs perfectly, even on a directory with
&gt;&gt; spaces (although it opens a DOS box, of course). Also, PHP 5 does not 
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; this problem -- but in this case I'm using the file php-win.exe and the
&gt;&gt; others that come with it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anybody knows how to find (or build) a version of php_win.exe that
&gt;&gt; won't crash in this situation?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Many thanks in advance,
&gt;&gt;

Hi!
I've seen an php-gtk app working on a pocket pc, it's called php-nmapfe 
and can we reached from  the gtk.php.net from these link: 
http://gtk.php.net/apps/?the_cat=700

Sure it helps you, but I don't know if gtk.php works ...

Hi

I know there is still much time, but today I thought about an installer 
for PHP-Gtk2, at least for windows.

People should have the possibility to install php-gtk in a really easy 
way by clicking on an .exe, pointint to some "next" buttons and all works.
This can be done very easily with the NSIS installer, as it is 
scriptable - just the compilation has to be done on a windows machine.

When having an installer, I think the chance is there to associate the 
php-gtk files with the installed php5.exe. This would ensure that the 
"install&amp;run" experience is perfect - click on a php-gtk application, 
and its window pops up. Now there is the question with the right file 
extension. I know we had the discussion two years ago, but there was no 
agreement among the people, and we didn't get a result.
The best extension - IMHO - was ".phpw", the "windowed php application".
Other suggestions were to have a context menu entry for opening the 
whole thing in the console, but as an addition to the console-less default.

Your thoughts?

Either .phpw or .phpg or .phg (if restricted to 3 letters) works for me.

I think an installer would be a great idea. It would be neat to write 
the installer in PHP-GTK and then use one of those "PHP compilers" to 
let people install PHP-GTK using PHP-GTK.

I thought .phpw was for "php Weiske" :) I'm not a big fan of 
abbreviating. I would vote for .phpgtk

I think something.phpgtk is great, cos tell us more about the content of
file :), it's more intuitive... like pygtk is...

It had been noted that sometime a php-qt can be out and it doesn't 
matter if you use php-gtk or php-qt - it's a _windowed_ php application 
in contrast to a command line one. That's why .php-gtk or .phpgtk is too 
specific, and .phpw would be ideal.

Hello everyone,

The only difference between a command line php script and a php-gtk
application is the loading of the gtk extension, but it's still a php
application. I do not see any need to clutter the name space with yet
another file extension. .php would work for me. But I prefer not to
associate my scripts as I tend to use multiple version of php on my system
:-)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; When working on a new WinBinder demo
&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://winbinder.sourceforge.net/),
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt; found out that php_win.exe for PHP 4 (from PHP-GTK) crashes when called
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; a folder with spaces. For example, c:\PHP\myapp\php_win.exe runs fine,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; c:\Program Files\myapp\php_win.exe consistently crashes. This can be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem for Windows users since the applications path typically has a
&gt;&gt; space.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; More specifically, php.exe (AppVer: 4.3.9.9) crashes php4ts.dll at offset
&gt;&gt;&gt; 000BB8E4 with code 0xC0000005 (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION). I'm using the
&gt;&gt;&gt; files from php-gtk-1.0.1a-win32.zip.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Interestingly, php.exe always runs perfectly, even on a directory with
&gt;&gt;&gt; spaces (although it opens a DOS box, of course). Also, PHP 5 does not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; this problem -- but in this case I'm using the file php-win.exe and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; others that come with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anybody knows how to find (or build) a version of php_win.exe that
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't crash in this situation?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many thanks in advance,
&gt;&gt;&gt;

Is it crashing because the program is trying to output some warning or
eror?, try putting

ob_start();

as the first line.

ok now I finally got the mesage ;)
can you confirm if this version works (works for me but with my system who
knows ~)
http://www.firepages.org/stuff/php_win_short.exe (52kb)

if it does perhaps someone can fix up this code &amp; apply ?

 char *args[4], *prog = NULL;
 char binary_file[] = "php.exe";
 char modulepath[_MAX_PATH];
 char shortpath[_MAX_PATH];
 // Look for php.exe in the same directory as php_win.exe
 if (GetModuleFileName(NULL, modulepath, _MAX_PATH)) {
  char *separator_location = strrchr(modulepath, '\\');
  if (separator_location) {
   struct stat statbuf;
   strcpy(separator_location+1, binary_file);
   if (stat(modulepath, &amp;statbuf) == 0) {
    if (((statbuf.st_mode &amp; S_IEXEC) == S_IEXEC)) {
     //&gt;&gt;needs error checking&lt;&lt;//
     GetShortPathName( modulepath, shortpath, _MAX_PATH) ;
     prog = shortpath ;
    }
   }
  }

OK , you tried short  file names ?

"C:\PROGRA~1\WINBIN~1\php-win.exe" ttfreader.phpw

&gt; Another plus for .phpw would be that if you have a folder full of .php

That could be handled with the .inc extension for include files.

&gt; application. I do not see any need to clutter the name space with yet
&gt; another file extension. .php would work for me. 
See it like .com for command line windows programs and .exe for normal 
graphical windows programs.

Thats not exactly correct. .com files are loaded into a fixed memory
position, and replaces the command intepreter on load. where .exe files
can be loaded into any memory location, and moved arround (no absolute
jumps).

You could build graphical applications in a .com file.

installer too. If the extension is .phpgtk, I know that I can't run the 
file without php-gtk and the same with php-qt.

It really isn't a big deal and I'm not going to make a fuss about it 
since I don't use php on windows anyway.

Ok, I give up.
Just remembered that I had many .com apps in my DOS days, and nearly 
none today.

So we use .php as normal file extension for php-gtk applications, and 
associate them with php. Ok.

With all respect to Frank , most windows users like thier extensions!

What has confuddled and alienated many potential new (win32) php-gtk users
is simply running the apps in the first place.
How many potential new users downloaded php-gtk and never even managed to
get the samples working ? I suspect many more than you think ... I know lots
of them ;)
How many more got the samples working then realised thier local apache/php
installation no longer worked ? (a different issue but anyway)

I hate messing with anybody elses registry , but file association is not
hard with NSIS-like installers &amp; even win32_std etc can mess with the
registry in a 'pure' PHP installer.

I like .phpw

+ I still like the phpx:// protocol for win32 which nobody seemed interested
in &amp; which I would advocate further if  I were not so unsure of the security
concerns... with such you could run a php-gtk app from the command prompt ,
a shortcut , windows explorer , IE address bar etc even &lt;a
href="phpx://my_app"&gt;my_app&lt;/a&gt; , sadly so can any web page ~

Regardless I think there should be some direction from `somewhere` on this
matter if only as guidelines for those of us who make installers , I suspect
there will be many more such systems for PHP-GTK2 and a multitude of
differing approaches will be counter-productive for PHP-GTK.

Most of all , I think ignoring the issue ( I  understand &amp; accept that not
all think it IS an issue ) and leaving it as simple .php files is a mistake.

&gt; Another plus for .phpw would be that if you have a folder full of .php
&gt; files (classes), one could know very easy which file to click.

&gt; I like .phpw

I use .phpw for WinBinder scripts for the same reason. It's easy to spot the
actual Windows script in a list of files. It gets even better (think about
the end user) if you create an association with php-win.exe.

Hello,

I'm trying to get php-gtk working on a debian linux system and am having some
trouble. I'm using:

machine:~$ gtk-config --version
1.2.10

and:

machine:~$ php --version
PHP 4.3.9RC2 (cgi) (built: Sep  1 2004 15:12:50)

I've downloaded the 1.0.0 source tar.gz from the website, and when I try to
run buildconf, I get the following:

machine:~/php-gtk-1.0.0$ ./buildconf
configure.in:9: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_WITH_PHP_CONFIG
  run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
  or see http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending%20aclocal
configure.in:32: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_BUILDDIR
configure.in:33: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_DIR
configure.in:34: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_SRCDIR
configure.in:35: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_ALWAYS_SHARED
aclocal: cannot open php_gtk.m4: No such file or directory
make: *** [buildmk.stamp] Error 1

So I looked around and I see php_gtk_new.m4 and php_gtk_old.m4. Being
optimistic,
I coped php_gtk_new.m4 to php_gtk.m4 and buildconf then completed
successfully
in spite of about 100 "underquoted definition of" warning messages. Then I
did
./configure and that completed also. The make starts off fine, but then
blows up
part way through with this:

looking at the file ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c I see that the first 4 lines are
as follows:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fopen(--): failed to open stream: No such file or
directory in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on
line &lt;b&gt;110&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fgets(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource
in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on line
&lt;b&gt;34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

which is of course not valid C code. These errors are, I believe, coming
from the
Defs_Parser constructor (in generator/scheme.php) which is being called from
generator/generator.php, which is being executed directly from the
Makefiles in
many places with "--" as the first argument. I was hoping perhaps someone
could
point me at the root of the problem. Thanks very much!

Hi Nate,

I just ran into the same problem trying to install this morning on 
Fedora 2. The problem is that generator/scheme.php is trying to load a 
file that doesn't exist. Because the file doesn't exist a php error 
message gets written into the ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c file.  That's what 
causes all sorts of syntax errors.

It looks like the CVS version has been updated so you may want to try 
that. But here is what I did:

Edit generator/scheme.php: line 110
change from:
	$this-&gt;parse_tree = parse(fopen($defs_file, 'r'));
to:
	$this-&gt;parse_tree = parse(@fopen($defs_file, 'r'));
(optionally and 'the right way' is to do a check like if 
(is_readable($defs_file)) ...)

Then I did a make clean.
Then I had to remove ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c
Then start over with ./buildconf etc...

My steps may not have been the most efficient way to go about it but it 
worked for me.

Hi

&gt; As of now, PHP-GTK 2 should be compileable and able to run this:
Erm, call me dumb or so, but how shall I compile it?
I checked out the cvs
 &gt; cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co php-gtk
as there is no PHP-GTK2.
Now the buildconf doesn't really work (something missing)
 &gt; configure:3505: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0
 &gt; configure:3619: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_GTK_2_0
and then configure exists, but stops with

That's right. The HEAD is where PHP-GTK2 development is done.

Do you have gtk+2 libraries and development material installed? Try looking
for gtk2.m4 and glib2.m4 on your hard drive.

I was in the same way... trying to check out the PHP_GTK_2 branch... but 
I realiced the HEAD is where gtk2 goes, if you see the ChangeLog ... 
then you realize of it.

The next week I'll get all the packages needed to compile this and then 
I 'll try to run this under win32... I dont't know the issues I should 
face to get it working -just if its possible with the actual sources- 
but will give it a try anyway... 


Sincerely,
Gonzalo MC.

Hi

&gt;&gt; Do you think wrapping enums/flags as objects has advantages? PyGtk 2.3.x
&gt;&gt; seems to do it this way.
&gt; backtracking, a class/function could be made which could be called when 
&gt; the programmer needs the name explicitly. The function returns the name 
&gt; b) one function which accepts a "enum type group" as parameter
&gt;    getEnumName( 4, ENUM_CURSOR);

I just sat down and made such a function, but see yourself:

8&lt;=================

&lt;?php
/**
*   helper function to determine return values
*   @author Christian Weiske &lt;cweiske@php.net&gt;
*/

//that we have something to find
if( !extension_loaded('gtk')) {
     dl( 'php_gtk.' . PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);
}


/**
*   returns a enum name for a given value
*   you can (and should) specify a group like "PLOT" or so
*   to limit the search results
*/
function resolvEnum( $nValue, $strGroup = '')
{
     $strGroup = strtoupper( $strGroup);

     $arEnums    = get_defined_constants();
     $arFound    = array();

     foreach( $arEnums as $strEnumName =&gt; $nDefValue)
     {
         if( $nValue !== $nDefValue) continue;
         //here we could remove all the not GTK_ and GDK_ constants if 
we'd like to

         if( strstr( $strEnumName, '_' . $strGroup . '_') === false
             &amp;&amp; substr( $strEnumName, 0,  strlen( $strGroup) + 1) !==

&gt; Subject: [PHP-GTK-DEV] problem compiling php-gtk on debian linux system
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to get php-gtk working on a debian linux system and am having
&gt; some
&gt; trouble. I'm using:
&gt;
&gt; machine:~$ gtk-config --version
&gt; 1.2.10
&gt;
&gt; and:
&gt;
&gt; machine:~$ php --version
&gt; PHP 4.3.9RC2 (cgi) (built: Sep  1 2004 15:12:50)
&gt;
&gt; I've downloaded the 1.0.0 source tar.gz from the website, and
&gt; when I try to
&gt; run buildconf, I get the following:
&gt;
&gt; machine:~/php-gtk-1.0.0$ ./buildconf
&gt; configure.in:9: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_WITH_PHP_CONFIG
&gt;   run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
&gt;   or see
&gt; http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending%20aclocal
&gt; configure.in:32: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_BUILDDIR
&gt; configure.in:33: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_DIR
&gt; configure.in:34: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_SRCDIR
&gt; configure.in:35: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_ALWAYS_SHARED
&gt; aclocal: cannot open php_gtk.m4: No such file or directory
&gt; make: *** [buildmk.stamp] Error 1
&gt;
&gt; So I looked around and I see php_gtk_new.m4 and php_gtk_old.m4. Being
&gt; optimistic,
&gt; I coped php_gtk_new.m4 to php_gtk.m4 and buildconf then completed
&gt; successfully
&gt; in spite of about 100 "underquoted definition of" warning messages. Then
&gt; I did
&gt; ./configure and that completed also. The make starts off fine, but then
&gt; blows up
&gt; part way through with this:
&gt;
&gt; ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c:1: syntax error before '&lt;' token

&gt; make: *** [ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.lo] Error 1
&gt;
&gt; looking at the file ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c I see that the first 4 lines are
&gt; as follows:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fopen(--): failed to open stream: No such file or
&gt; directory in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on

&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;:  fgets(): supplied argument is not a valid stream
&gt; resource in &lt;b&gt;/root/packages/php-gtk-1.0.0/generator/scheme.php&lt;/b&gt; on
&gt; line &lt;b&gt;34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;
&gt; which is of course not valid C code. These errors are, I believe, coming
&gt; from the
&gt; Defs_Parser constructor (in generator/scheme.php) which is being
&gt; called from
&gt; generator/generator.php, which is being executed directly from the
&gt; Makefiles in
&gt; many places with "--" as the first argument. I was hoping perhaps
&gt; someone could
&gt; point me at the root of the problem. Thanks very much!

&gt; Hi Nate,
&gt;
&gt; I just ran into the same problem trying to install this morning on 
&gt; Fedora 2. The problem is that generator/scheme.php is trying to load a 
&gt; file that doesn't exist. Because the file doesn't exist a php error 
&gt; message gets written into the ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c file.  That's what 
&gt; causes all sorts of syntax errors.
&gt;
&gt; It looks like the CVS version has been updated so you may want to try 
&gt; that. But here is what I did:
&gt;
&gt; Edit generator/scheme.php: line 110
&gt; change from:
&gt;     $this-&gt;parse_tree = parse(fopen($defs_file, 'r'));
&gt; to:
&gt;     $this-&gt;parse_tree = parse(@fopen($defs_file, 'r'));
&gt; (optionally and 'the right way' is to do a check like if 
&gt; (is_readable($defs_file)) ...)
&gt;
&gt; Then I did a make clean.
&gt; Then I had to remove ext/gtk+/gen_gtk.c
&gt; Then start over with ./buildconf etc...
&gt;
&gt; My steps may not have been the most efficient way to go about it but 
&gt; it worked for me.

Dear Friend,

I was just talking to my friend, Internet marketing expert Corey Rudl, the other day \
and I was shocked at what he told me...

He has been working day and night testing new ideas and strategies all year... Would \
you believe they've done 1,325 tests since January 1st!

But despite all the late nights and long hours, he said it was totally worth it \
because he learned a TON from all the strategies and ideas he tested.

That's how he's grown his online businesses to over $7.6 million in online sales each \
year and how he gets over 1.8 million visitors to his web sites every month! (Yes, I \
said every month!)

And that's actually why I'm contacting you today... I have arranged the opportunity \
for you to "STEAL" the results of these tests and start using them to increase your \
profits.

Because of my strong affiliate relationship with Corey and his company, he has agreed \
to give my subscribers a head start and use his brand-new, never before released \
strategies that he has spent the last year secretly testing, including:

Step-by-step instructions you can use to start your very own Internet business in as \
little as 48 hours!

How to build a top-selling web site... for less than $100! No matter how small your \
budget is, Corey shows you the cheapest ways to build a web site that sells!

Where to find hot products (in 20 minutes or LESS!) that you can start selling TODAY! \
These in-demand products will sell like hot cakes, no matter what your experience!

100s of NO COST and cheap online tools, resources, and software that you can use to \
automate your web site (and save yourself at least 35 hours every week)!

How to get #1 rankings in the search engines and get tons of NO COST traffic from the \
"Big Guys" like Google!

Secrets to writing sales copy that increases sales by 400% (or MORE)!

Get 1,000s of NEW visitors to your web site... for FREE .... and this is only 7 of \
literally hundreds of strategies and tools that he is releasing for the first time \
ever.

To make sure you appreciate the enormous value of this, I should tell you that just \
collecting this information took Corey's team over 1,248 hours (I know that might \
sound outrageous, but if you want to do the math, he had up to 7 people working on \
this at times, plus himself!)

I know these strategies are going to make my business tons of extra money in 2004 and \
as my subscriber I want to make sure you experience the same rewards, so go to...

http://www.marketingtips.com/t.cgi/823254

I highly recommend that you check it out... I managed to get you a head start on \
these strategies and sincerely hope you can take me up on this! I guarantee you'll be \
glad you did!

All the best...

YOUR NAME HERE

P.S. And in typical Corey Rudl style, he has been generous enough to let you test his \
strategies risk-free for a year. If you don't like them (if for some reason you DON'T \
like making money ;-) then you DO NOT PAY!

Hi,

If you have been marketing on the Internet for any length of time, chances are you \
have heard of Corey Rudl. Corey is one of the most successful REAL-LIFE Internet \
marketing experts online today.

As one of my mentors, I have learned more about the hard- hitting Internet marketing \
strategies that really work directly from Corey than any other so-called Internet \
marketing expert. So when I saw Corey's newest idea it only took me a few minutes \
before I was once again amazed by the POWERFUL STRATEGIES he had uncovered.

I am talking about a monthly publication that gives you the NO BS EXAMPLES of real \
people making real money and the exact STEP-BY-STEP DETAILS of how they're doing it!

Corey introduces you to people just like you and me -- real people who are making \
real money on the Internet -- and shows you the exact strategies they have used to \
generate incomes in excess of $100,000 to $600,000 online every year... most of them \
working from home!

I was in his new private site just yesterday, and even though I've personally been \
marketing on the `Net for quite some time, I learned some killer new tricks from \
people like...

Robert who turned his $275 a week paycheck into a site of online investigative \
resources that takes him only 2 hours each day to run... while earning him OVER \
$250,000 A YEAR in profits!


Ellen, a work-at-home mom who generates a great income by simply selling her homemade \
soaps from her site!


Ken who made $300,000+ IN HIS SECOND YEAR OF BUSINESS by teaching people how to \
daytrade on the Internet... all from his beachfront condo in Hawaii.


Andy, who makes $600,000 a year educating others about the hairloss industry and \
showing people how he managed to reverse his own hairloss!


... and these are just a few of the people that have already been EXTENSIVELY \
INTERVIEWED for Corey's brand new private web site. With his monthly subscription you \
will be exposed to 2 additional interviews every single month.

IMPORTANT NOTE: These are not the typical amateur interviews... You will hear these \
people answer some extremely tough questions about the exact strategies, software, \
and tools they used to start, build, and grow their businesses to their current \
success. You'll even hear about the mistakes they made, and how they suggest YOU \
avoid them!

So if you want to skip the failing promotions and get a personal tour of REAL WEB \
SITES built by REAL PEOPLE making REAL PROFITS on the Internet, then go to...

http://dynamic.secretstotheirsuccess.com/t.cgi/823254

... and take advantage of the invaluable tips and tricks that these Internet \
successes reveal so that you can start applying them to your business today.

All the best,

P.S. As an extra bonus, you'll also have the opportunity to enter a special draw for \
a site review done by Corey and his team (valued at $5,000).

Each month, a member's site is drawn and then reviewed by Corey and his team, who \
dissect the site and give tips and tricks they can use to really accellerate their \
growth and sales.

PLUS! Even if your site isn't chosen, you get the benefit of seeing all of the \
profitable suggestions that Corey and his team make -- many of which will likely \
apply to your site, too!

Hi,

It's not often that I am surprised by something I see online. And it's even more rare \
that I stumble upon a book that causes me to literally stop what I am doing and write \
a letter to everyone I know.

But I just discovered that Corey Rudl -- probably one of the best-known and most \
well-respected experts on the subject of e-mail marketing -- has just released all \
the details behind how he used e-mail marketing to make $213,705 and attract 41,409 \
new opt-in subscribers in the last 30 days alone!

The truth is, I still can't figure out exactly WHY Corey has made this information \
available, since it gives everyone -- including his competitors -- the chance to \
steal the secrets he's spent the last 6 years perfecting!

He shows you everything from growing a super-responsive opt-in list as quickly as \
possible, to generating the highest possible revenue from every e-mail you send, to \
protecting your business from being wrongly accused of spamming and knowing how to \
effectively deal with it if you are...

He also teaches you when you should mail, how you should mail, what you should write, \
and when you should send it so that you are guaranteed the best possible results from \
each and every e-mail...

His years of testing are going to completely eliminate all of YOUR guesswork!

The thing is, the e-mail marketing industry HAS changed dramatically over the past \
few years. And while company after company has gone out of business just trying to \
keep up with all these changes, Corey has continued to generate over $2.4 million \
every year with e-mail marketing.

And this book shows you step-by-step what he did and how he did it so you can take \
his strategies and model them to create your own success.

With over 430+ pages that include tons of great real-life examples, I was especially \
impressed by the way Corey's book breaks down exactly HOW you can implement -- and \
test -- all the tips and techniques that he teaches into your own business.

I still think that Corey's going to regret giving all this information away, so I \
would advise you to grab this book while you can! It really does tell you everything \
you need to do to grow your business successfully with e-mail marketing. Find out \
more at:

http://www.marketingtips.com/emailsecrets/t.cgi/823254/

All the best...

Dear Friend,

Would you be excited if I told that YOU COULD EARN $3,500 EVERY DAY from a web site \
that gets only 100 visitors a day... and sells a product that costs less than $150?

You could be earning over $100,000 every month!

This isn't hype. And this certainly is no joke! It's rare that I am this impressed by \
a marketing technique... but this literally blew my mind! This is information that we \
are sharing with our subscribers only -- so listen up!

I watched in utter amazement as this guy (who we'll call "Mr. H" for the moment) \
turned...

100 visitors a day into $1,277,500 a year in profits!

... and he's just starting out!

Get this -- he expects to be earning $10,000,000 a year when he's finished \
implementing this SIMPLE, yet totally INGENIOUS MARKETING STRATEGY!

This isn't about banner advertising... search engines... or newsgroups. And it's \
certainly not about some rare, high priced product... or huge volumes of traffic. \
It's about none of that.

This guy has developed AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY TO MARKET YOUR BUSINESS on the Internet! \
And he's blown the gimmicky theories of those "so-called" marketing experts right out \
of the water!

He's proven that -- using this one totally brilliant marketing strategy -- the small \
business owner can EARN HUGE PROFITS CONSISTENTLY! Day after day, month after \
month... the sales just keep rolling in!

What's his secret? I can't tell you here. There's not enough room in this e-mail!

It took a 90-minute audiotape to capture the original interview with this marketing \
genius... and ANOTHER tape to answer the questions of 130 participants!

However, you're in luck! For the FIRST TIME EVER, "Mr. H's" blueprint for success is \
being released...

Like I said before, it's really rare that I endorse marketing material... but as soon \
as I heard his unique success formula, I knew that I had a responsibility to share \
this EXTREMELY PROFITABLE information with our subscribers.

This guy has really proven that ANY SMALL ONLINE BUSINESS can earn big money... using \
the right approach!

To begin learning "Mr. H's" proven techniques and start making your web site a huge \
success story, I highly recommend that you check out

http://www.marketingtips.com/t.cgi/823254/directsales

And don't hesitate! This limited-time opportunity to discover his secrets will only \
be available for a few more days!

Sincerely,

theeb basheer

Hmm, you are right. However, I don't think this is PHP-GTK's fault. The
style parameter in C code supplied to gtk_toolbar_new() is
GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT. Christian or Steph, can you convert Christian's
example into C code and see whether it still happens?

Christian,

&gt; @andrei/steph:
&gt;   I've commented out the php-web section in class.xsl as I don't

Did you comment it out in the existing section or in your new one?
phpweb is a mode that generates .php doc files instead of plain .html,
so it's important.

S&gt; hmm.  (my copy, that error's line 157..)

S&gt; Was this using the test script I attached before, the one with Christian's
S&gt; monochrome pixmap in it?

S&gt; If so, could you please try messing with the parameters for the
S&gt; cursor_new_from_pixmap() call?

S&gt; e.g.
S&gt; $cursor = gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap($mask, $mask, $style-&gt;white,
$style-&gt;&gt;black, 1, 1);
S&gt; $cursor = gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap($pixmap, $mask, null, null, 1, 1);
S&gt; (any variations on the theme)

S&gt; Just to confuse the issue further, in the original GDK docs for this, two
S&gt; bitmaps are used..!

S&gt; - Steph

I did try with the mono pixmap and it still did not like it. The only
way was to make the php function accept 2 bitmaps and feed it 2 masks
but there was no way to get a white pixel in the cursor.
I will have a bit more of a play

I think the best way to get this working would be to step through the
pixmap data and recreate it as a bitmap. Looks messy but I will give
it a go.

S&gt; Hi Tom,

S&gt; Excuse me for being dim, I still haven't had a chance to play with build

S&gt; I'm missing something here.. if both parameters are bitmaps, where's the
S&gt; pixmap coming from that needs to be converted?

S&gt; - Steph

From this line in the php script :-)

list($pixmap, $mask) = gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm_d($gdkwin, null, $cursorpmp);

The mask is a bitmap ...halfway there the $pixmap is a true Gdkpixmap
... that is the problem


How else would you generate the bitmap (easily) in php?

S&gt; I was assuming the user would actually feed it two bitmaps, but I appreciate
S&gt; what you're saying about that being less straightforward from the user
S&gt; perspective.  (They'd have to create the bitmap twice.)

S&gt; Another approach might be to silently ignore the first parameter and copy
S&gt; the second to it internally.. no idea whether that could work until I try it
S&gt; tho'..

S&gt; Or I could just stop going on about it and say 'thank you' :)

Copying the mask works but you only end up with an all white or an all
black cursor. By using the 3 colour xpm file you can have a funky
white border around your cursor.

No thanks are needed, I enjoy a challenge. the hard bit
was figuring out how to get hold of the pixel data.

I think that a pixmap always gets a transparent colour, whether you
put null or a value which will always force it to a greater colour
depth (this is just a guess at this stage).

the only function I found that calls this is in drag and drop code
which creates 2 'pixmaps' but using bitmaps and hard coded data bits.

gtk_drag_get_cursor() in gtkdnd.c

I just need to work out what format the data is in to transfer it
from a pixmap to a newly created bitmap.

Hi


Today I tried to create my own cursor....

The Gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap requires two pixmaps, but the pixmaps 
may have only 2 colors, so it could be a bitmap (but that's gtk 
specific). Now I tried it, and the application crashes.

In the gtk manual they created the cursor with the help of 
gdk_bitmap_create_from_data, but that's missing in php-gtk.

Am I'm right assuming that the create_cursor won't work?

======================
&lt;?php
if( !extension_loaded('gtk')) {	
	dl( 'php_gtk.' . PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);
}

$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_default_size(300, 300);
$window-&gt;connect_object('destroy', array('gtk', 'main_quit'));

transparent = &amp;new GdkColor(0, 0, 0);

$cursor = array(
  "5 5 2 1",
  "0 m white",
  "1 m black",
  "11111",
  "10000",
  "10000",
  "10000",
  "10000"
);
$cursormask = array(
  "5 5 2 1",
  "0 m white",
  "1 m black",
  "11111",
  "10000",
  "10000",
  "10000",
  "10000"
);

$window-&gt;realize();
list($pixmap, $mask) = Gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm_d($window-&gt;window, 
$transparent, $cursor);
list($pixmask, $mask) = Gdk::pixmap_create_from_xpm_d($window-&gt;window, 
$transparent, $cursor);

$style	= &amp;new GtkStyle();
$cursor = Gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap( $pixmap, $pixmask, $style-&gt;white, 
$style-&gt;black, 1, 1);

//$pixmapwid = &amp;new GtkPixmap($pixmap, $mask);

//$window-&gt;add( $pixmapwid);
$window-&gt;show_all();
gtk::main();
?&gt;
======================

S&gt; If simply replacing pixmap with bitmap in the .defs file works, wouldn't it
S&gt; be easier to take the resulting entry from gen_gdk.c and put that into
S&gt; gdk.overrides?

S&gt; Just a thought

S&gt; - Steph

It is not that simple, one of the errors is expecting a pixmap for the
mask which is a bitmap (php complains not gdk). Fixing that was easy
by changing the defs. The other problem is that the pixmap doesn't
have a colour depth of 1 (16 I think it was) so you can't simply change
it to a bit map, hence the copy pixel by pixel. Doing it this way
keeps the php side simple to use. The code I gave needs to go into the
overides file as long as it works under linux.

Hi


Andrei put the changes in cvs this night; and it works on my box.

A note...
The pixmap specs allow the first line to have 6 instead of 4 parameters; 
the last two can contain the x and y hotspot position for the case the 
pixmap is used as a cursor.

Would it be *hard* to make the x and y parameter in the 
cursor_new_from_pixmap optional (default 0,0) and try to use the hotspot 
coordinates from the first line of the pixmap array?

AZ&gt; Please download the snapshot and let me know if everything is okay.

I'm running PHP 4.3.8, and I'm having the following problem when I run 
./buildconf:

[root@orome php-gtk-1.0.1]# ./buildconf
configure.in:9: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_WITH_PHP_CONFIG
   run info '(automake)Extending aclocal' or see

make: *** [buildmk.stamp] Error 1

So, I ran autoconf, instead. Got this:

[root@orome php-gtk-1.0.1]# autoconf
configure.in:65: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
       If this token and others are legitimate, please use
       m4_pattern_allow. See the Autoconf documentation.

But, now there's a configure file, so I run ./configure:

[root@orome php-gtk-1.0.1]# ./configure
configure: error: cannot run /bin/sh ./config.sub

Then, I scrapped everything and decided to start over. This time, I 
renamed php_gtk_new.m4 to php_gtk.m4. When I ran ./buildconf this time, 
I received a ton of "warning: underquoted definition" messages, but it 
produced a configure file just fine at the end:

Configuring for:
   PHP Api Version:   20020918
   Zend Module Api No:   20020429
   Zend Extension Api No:   20021010
rebuilding configure

Then I did:
./configure
make
make install

All worked just fine. But now I've got to figure out why make exited 
with errors when I did the configure line I used with 1.0.0:

./configure --with-gnome-config=/usr/bin --enable-gtkhtml 
--enable-gdkpixbuf --enable-scintilla

Nonetheless, I have a vanilla installation that works fine. I even 
tested a PHP-GTK application with it... works great.

I have just discovered that it is possible to register object constants.
This raises interesting possibilities. In PHP-GTK 1, the various
enums/flags are simply integers, so it is hard sometimes to figure out
what 0 or 2 means when trying to debug the applications. With the object
approach, each enum could be an object wrapper, that knows how to
compare itself, output its string representation, etc. The downside is
that objects take more memory, obviously.

Do you think wrapping enums/flags as objects has advantages? PyGtk 2.3.x
seems to do it this way.

Two things.

1. I hacked in a static class variable called '__gtype' which contains
the GType object corresponding to the class it's in. For example,
GtkButton::$__gtype will give you the GType object for it. To get the
actual value of the type, GtkButton::$__gtype-&gt;type. Nifty or not?

2. I am trying to figure out how to go about doing constants. I can
either leave them in the global namespace, e.g. GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, or
I can move into each class' namespace, e.g. GtkWindow::TOPLEVEL. The
access to the second version is a tad slower than the first, but I think
it achieves a nice encapsulation. Thoughts?

Hi

While documenting the glade extension I stumbled over the 
signal_autoconnect function.

It does not require but accept one parameter of type array.
As I didn't find any other documentation and didn't get smart of the 
php-gtk sources:

Could somebody (Andrei?) explain the meaning of this array?

Regards/MfG,
Christian Weiske

&gt; Two things.
&gt;
&gt; 1. I hacked in a static class variable called '__gtype' which contains
&gt; the GType object corresponding to the class it's in. For example,
&gt; GtkButton::$__gtype will give you the GType object for it. To get the
&gt; actual value of the type, GtkButton::$__gtype-&gt;type. Nifty or not?

:) it's very PHP 5-ish

&gt; 2. I am trying to figure out how to go about doing constants. I can
&gt; either leave them in the global namespace, e.g. GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, or
&gt; I can move into each class' namespace, e.g. GtkWindow::TOPLEVEL. The
&gt; access to the second version is a tad slower than the first, but I think
&gt; it achieves a nice encapsulation. Thoughts?

I prefer global, but then I came out of the Ark.  Should there be a poll on
this on the general list?

__type seems a bit odd - is it a little clearer to follow the existing API

GType::from_object($object)-&gt;type
GType::from_class('GtkButton')-&gt;type

-- definatly move them to the class :) - I dont think that would be the

Another thought struck (as they do) - presumably the gtype thing won't break
PHP-GTK BC in itself (because the 'nice' ways of getting type etc won't be
changed), but changing the namespace for class constants will - won't it?

(Prevent me from burbling on if I'm wrong please someone)

Hmm, that's an idea. PyGtk implements other special proprerties, like
__doc__ (which gives you back class documentation including signals,
properties, etc), __signals (user-registered signals), __properties
(user-registered properties), etc. What should we do about those?

Okay. They'll actualy be in top-level class namespace, that is
Gtk::TOOLBAR_TEXT, rather than GtkToolbar::TEXT.

I was also thinking about registering classes for each enum type, for
example GtkAttachOptionsType that will have -&gt;enum_values property that
lists all enums belonging to the type, and also a method to take an
integer enum and give you back its name (debugging). Thoughts?

 From a documentation and code readibilty angle, these magic vars are 
always a little difficult to understand.
alot of those look like they should be part of the reflection stuff ???
__doc__ = $x = new ReflectionClass($object); $x-&gt;getDoc();
__signals = GSignal::list_in_object($object);
__properties = $x = new ReflectionClass($object); 
$x-&gt;getUserDefinedProperties();


I'm still annoyed you snuck __get / __set / __call in rather than using 
a new language construct :)

The differences between GTK1 and GTK2 is big enough to justify
incompatibilities. On top of that we have a new, or at least improved,
object model in PHP5 so most sripts would bennefit from a rewrite.

Users are free to stay with php4+gtk1 or update to php5+gtk2 when it's
released.

Hey Frank, I'm only _saying_!

I know how big the differences are and fully appreciate why there's likely
to be a handful of major BC breaks.  It's just that it's only a fortnight or
so since I last asked the BC question.. and there seems to have been a
turnaround in policy since then.

I don't think I missed much, but I may have blinked last Thursday.

I don't have a vested interest either way.  I think there's an opportunity
to create something very cool indeedy here, and I hope Andrei grabs it.  But
where's the fun if everyone agrees?

I think that version 2 needs to take full advantage of all the new 
features of PHP 5 and should be considered a whole new language all 
together.  I think that this probably won't be the only BC break as 
things go forward anyway.  If it is the only BC break and someone is 
that upset about it couldn't they just include a PHP file that defines 
all of the 'old' constants in the global namespace?  The file could even 
be packaged with the distribution just in case someone wants it.

We all want BC but many of us (me included) would chew our own arms off  for
Z2 (...well one of them anyway).

I have a couple of  `commercial` apps in php-gtk but even given total BC I
would rewrite them anyway to take advantage of just PHP5 features let alone
Gtk2.

Simon.

http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-python/pygtk/examples/gobject/signal.py?rev=1.4&amp;view=auto

The self.__gobject_init__() is what looks in __signals to see how they
should be registered.

&gt; __properties = $x = new ReflectionClass($object); 
&gt; $x-&gt;getUserDefinedProperties();

Same thing here.

Perhaps we could come up with a different way of registering them..

&gt; I'm still annoyed you snuck __get / __set / __call in rather than using 
&gt; a new language construct :)

Heh, I didn't sneak them in, I just wrote ext/overload! I wish we had a
language construct too.

combination of Gtk2 + PHP5 fully justifies any sort of BC breakage that
we may need. After all, PHP-GTK 1 was written without any sort of

and I would be loathe to have to preserve something stupid if we can

PHP 4 if they feel so. Of course there will be work in rewriting the

I actually agree with you about BC breakage per se, purely and simply

not.  However this particular BC breakage is also moving further away from
the GTK+ API.

Right. I actually want to stick to Gtk+ API as closely as possible, so
that anyone can write a higher level wrapper on top of that. I'll see if
I can think of another way to register signals/properties and to obtain
class documentation.

Hi


&gt; Do you think wrapping enums/flags as objects has advantages? PyGtk 2.3.x
&gt; seems to do it this way.
I think it would be better to have the normal int types. For the 
backtracking, a class/function could be made which could be called when 
the programmer needs the name explicitly. The function returns the name 
to a given integer. Additionally we'd need
a) different functions for each enum type
    $enumresolv-&gt;getCursorName( 4);
b) one function which accepts a "enum type group" as parameter
    getEnumName( 4, ENUM_CURSOR);

Eh, how the hell is it going to do that? An integer does not carry any
additional information with it.

That sucks. :)

&gt; b) one function which accepts a "enum type group" as parameter

That sucks less, but still sucks. :)

The object way would be:

  php: echo ENUM_CURSOR;
  output: &lt;enum CURSOR_ARROW of type CursorType&gt;

The only difference in speed would be when we need to extract its

That should change...
I just think that this helper wouldn't be needed very often.

How to do the thing with the function:
One could use the get_defined_constants() and filter all the names 
beginning with the group, e.g. "GTK_CURSOR" or so. Then the array could 
be flipped and the right value selected - and there is the name.

I know that a "real" oo solution would be better, but I don't think it's 
worth it.

&gt; I have just discovered that it is possible to register object constants.
&gt; This raises interesting possibilities. In PHP-GTK 1, the various
&gt; enums/flags are simply integers, so it is hard sometimes to figure out
&gt; what 0 or 2 means when trying to debug the applications. With the object
&gt; approach, each enum could be an object wrapper, that knows how to
&gt; compare itself, output its string representation, etc. The downside is
&gt; that objects take more memory, obviously.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think wrapping enums/flags as objects has advantages? PyGtk 2.3.x

I agree with Christian. It seems like a lot of work for a little gain. 
We are talking about debugging code so if the only benefit is what gets 
output, that is not really too critical.  Are there other benefits that 
would come from this?

What about use in regular (not debugging) code though?  To create a 
popup window would you first have to instantiate a GTK_WINDOW_POPUP 
object?  Again it seems like a lot of work to pass the number 2 to a 
constructor.

&gt; AZ&gt; Please download the snapshot and let me know if everything is okay.
&gt; AZ&gt; I hope to release it tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm running PHP 4.3.8, and I'm having the following problem when I run 
&gt; ./buildconf:
&gt; 
&gt; [root@orome php-gtk-1.0.1]# ./buildconf
&gt; configure.in:9: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_WITH_PHP_CONFIG
&gt;    run info '(automake)Extending aclocal' or see

&gt; configure.in:35: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_ALWAYS_SHARED
&gt; aclocal: cannot open php_gtk.m4: No such file or directory
&gt; make: *** [buildmk.stamp] Error 1
&gt; 
&gt; So, I ran autoconf, instead. Got this:
&gt; 
&gt; [root@orome php-gtk-1.0.1]# autoconf
&gt; configure.in:65: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
&gt;        If this token and others are legitimate, please use
&gt;        m4_pattern_allow. See the Autoconf documentation.
&gt; 
&gt; But, now there's a configure file, so I run ./configure:
&gt; 
&gt; [root@orome php-gtk-1.0.1]# ./configure
&gt; configure: error: cannot run /bin/sh ./config.sub
&gt; 
&gt; Then, I scrapped everything and decided to start over. This time, I 
&gt; renamed php_gtk_new.m4 to php_gtk.m4. When I ran ./buildconf this time, 
&gt; I received a ton of "warning: underquoted definition" messages, but it 
&gt; produced a configure file just fine at the end:
&gt; 
&gt; Configuring for:
&gt;    PHP Api Version:   20020918
&gt;    Zend Module Api No:   20020429
&gt;    Zend Extension Api No:   20021010
&gt; rebuilding configure
&gt; 
&gt; Then I did:
&gt; ./configure
&gt; make
&gt; make install
&gt; 
&gt; All worked just fine. But now I've got to figure out why make exited 
&gt; with errors when I did the configure line I used with 1.0.0:
&gt; 
&gt; ./configure --with-gnome-config=/usr/bin --enable-gtkhtml 
&gt; --enable-gdkpixbuf --enable-scintilla
&gt; 
&gt; Nonetheless, I have a vanilla installation that works fine. I even 
&gt; tested a PHP-GTK application with it... works great.

Hi Tom,

Excuse me for being dim, I still haven't had a chance to play with build
systems this week.

I'm missing something here.. if both parameters are bitmaps, where's the
pixmap coming from that needs to be converted?

&gt; S&gt; If simply replacing pixmap with bitmap in the .defs file
&gt; works, wouldn't it
&gt; S&gt; be easier to take the resulting entry from gen_gdk.c and put that into
&gt; S&gt; gdk.overrides?
&gt;
&gt; S&gt; Just a thought
&gt;
&gt; S&gt; - Steph
&gt;
&gt; It is not that simple, one of the errors is expecting a pixmap for the
&gt; mask which is a bitmap (php complains not gdk). Fixing that was easy
&gt; by changing the defs. The other problem is that the pixmap doesn't
&gt; have a colour depth of 1 (16 I think it was) so you can't simply change
&gt; it to a bit map, hence the copy pixel by pixel. Doing it this way
&gt; keeps the php side simple to use. The code I gave needs to go into the
&gt; overides file as long as it works under linux.

AZ&gt; Tom,

AZ&gt; Nice job on this one. However, I have a few notes. Firstly, this
AZ&gt; assertion seems to get triggered only on win32, isn't it? The Unix
AZ&gt; source code in gdkcursor.c does not have anything like that. Also, I
AZ&gt; don't see gdk_drawable_get_size() in my gtk+ 1.2 include files. Where
AZ&gt; did you find it?

AZ&gt; I might have to rewrite this to fit 1.2.x API.

I can only really test this on windows at the moment, but I will grab
1.2 and see what can be done (windows has 1.3 but it is supposed to be
very close to 1.2)

It shouldn't have a pixmap as a second parameter - that looks like an
original GTK+ bug to me.  Don't have the time to make a new build and check
right now, but if anyone does, all you'd need to do is alter gdk.defs so it
reads GdkBitmap for the second parameter of cursor_new_from_pixmap and
rebuild (for test purposes - actual fix should be added to overrides).

Anyone?

&gt;&gt;right now, but if anyone does, all you'd need to do is alter
&gt;&gt;gdk.defs so it
&gt;&gt;reads GdkBitmap for the second parameter of cursor_new_from_pixmap and
&gt;&gt;rebuild (for test purposes - actual fix should be added to overrides).

The *original* gtk functions require a pixmap...

You can't assume that the mask is the same as the cursor. What if I want 
to have black and white areas on my cursor?

Hi

&gt;&gt;Copying the mask works but you only end up with an all white or an all
&gt;&gt;black cursor. By using the 3 colour xpm file you can have a funky
&gt;&gt;white border around your cursor.
&gt; 
&gt; Heh, so you've just improved on what could be done with gdk?  That's wild :)

No. That's what the gtk did originally. A bitmap to hold black and white 
pixels how the cursor shall look, and a mask which cuts out the not 
needed parts

Wow, you used GdkImage?

/me is impressed

If simply replacing pixmap with bitmap in the .defs file works, wouldn't it
be easier to take the resulting entry from gen_gdk.c and put that into
gdk.overrides?

Just a thought

Thanks for trying this, Tom!

hmm.  (my copy, that error's line 157..)

Was this using the test script I attached before, the one with Christian's
monochrome pixmap in it?

If so, could you please try messing with the parameters for the
cursor_new_from_pixmap() call?

e.g.
$cursor = gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap($mask, $mask, $style-&gt;white,
$style-&gt;black, 1, 1);
$cursor = gdk::cursor_new_from_pixmap($pixmap, $mask, null, null, 1, 1);
(any variations on the theme)

Just to confuse the issue further, in the original GDK docs for this, two
bitmaps are used..!

Why not try doing as the GDK manual example shows it - with two _bitmaps_
not two _pixmaps_?  You'd need to recompile it to take two bitmaps, sorry..

I hadn't seen that example when I suggested the pixmap/bitmap mix.

The error you got, Tom, (and I managed to reproduce with two pixmaps) said
that the problem was both *maps didn't have a depth of 1.  If there's a
depth of 1, surely by definition that's a bitmap?  Or am I talking out of my
bottom (again)?

/me is running out of ideas, but suspects that in GDK there's less of a
distinction between pixmap and bitmap than there is in PHP-GTK

&gt; I think the best way to get this working would be to step through the

&gt; &gt; The win32 version is effectively a port of PHP-GTK - there's nothing on
&gt; &gt; win32 that you can't do on *nix, it's more likely you'd see problems the
&gt; &gt; other way around (i.e. developing on *nix and then distributing
&gt; on doze).
&gt; the build php-gtk-1.0 from gtk.php.net for windows lacks in syntax
&gt; enlightnement code for all languages. the fix is downloading
&gt; php_gtk_scintilla.dll patched from someone that had compiled it "fully".

ahhhhhhhhhh see where you're coming from now..!

I was assuming the user would actually feed it two bitmaps, but I appreciate
what you're saying about that being less straightforward from the user
perspective.  (They'd have to create the bitmap twice.)

Another approach might be to silently ignore the first parameter and copy
the second to it internally.. no idea whether that could work until I try it
tho'..

Or I could just stop going on about it and say 'thank you' :)

&gt; Copying the mask works but you only end up with an all white or an all
&gt; black cursor. By using the 3 colour xpm file you can have a funky
&gt; white border around your cursor.

Heh, so you've just improved on what could be done with gdk?  That's wild :)

&gt; No thanks are needed, I enjoy a challenge. the hard bit
&gt; was figuring out how to get hold of the pixel data.

I'll bet..

Tom,

Nice job on this one. However, I have a few notes. Firstly, this
assertion seems to get triggered only on win32, isn't it? The Unix
source code in gdkcursor.c does not have anything like that. Also, I
don't see gdk_drawable_get_size() in my gtk+ 1.2 include files. Where
did you find it?

I might have to rewrite this to fit 1.2.x API.

Hi


&gt;&gt;No. That's what the gtk did originally. A bitmap to hold black and white 
&gt;&gt;pixels how the cursor shall look, and a mask which cuts out the not 
&gt;&gt;needed parts
&gt; erm.. not in my copy it didn't!

That's what gdk was meant to do.

AZ&gt; Nice job on this one. However, I have a few notes. Firstly, this
AZ&gt; assertion seems to get triggered only on win32, isn't it? The Unix
AZ&gt; source code in gdkcursor.c does not have anything like that. Also, I
AZ&gt; don't see gdk_drawable_get_size() in my gtk+ 1.2 include files. Where
AZ&gt; did you find it?

AZ&gt; I might have to rewrite this to fit 1.2.x API.

When compiling PHP-GTK and using --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config the

This bug has been fixed in CVS.

Snapshots of the sources are packaged every three hours; this change
will be in the next snapshot. You can grab the snapshot at
http://snaps.php.net/.
 
Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.

Will be in PHP-GTK 1.0.1 release.

&gt; A note...
&gt; The pixmap specs allow the first line to have 6 instead of 4 parameters; 
&gt; the last two can contain the x and y hotspot position for the case the 
&gt; pixmap is used as a cursor.
&gt; 
&gt; Would it be *hard* to make the x and y parameter in the 
&gt; cursor_new_from_pixmap optional (default 0,0) and try to use the hotspot 
&gt; coordinates from the first line of the pixmap array?

Yes, it would be. The code that parses XPM data does not care at all
about x/y hotspot coordinates in Gtk+ 1.2.x. So it is impossible to get
access to them through any sort of data structure.

Ok.

I did something more drastic and got rid of the old build system
support. It was cauing problems with newer automake versions. So, now
PHP-GTK requires PHP 4.3.x to be built. The updated snapshot is up on
the site. Could you all please test again?

&gt; 
&gt; What about use in regular (not debugging) code though?  To create a 
&gt; popup window would you first have to instantiate a GTK_WINDOW_POPUP 
&gt; object?  Again it seems like a lot of work to pass the number 2 to a 
&gt; constructor.

No, you'd simply pass GTK_WINDOW_POPUP (a constant which happens to be
an object).

Hi

Is it just historically, that there are readonly properties in classes 
on the same side with getter functions?

E.g. GtkToolbar: style property, but get_button_relief() getter?

I think that's very inconsistent. But as long the situation will improve 
in php-gtk2, it's ok I think.

 New Comment:

I have the same problem and it looks like it might be a bug in Pear's
Getopt.

The problem is with calling PHP in this fashion

php -f file.php -- -o opt_value argument

The '--' is not interpreted as the end of PHP arguments, but rather as
the first script argument. The solution is, after configure, to replace
all occurences with a line in this style:

php -q file.php -o opt_value argument

i.e., replace -f with -q and remove the --

After that, run

make clean
find -name "gen_*" -exec rm {} \;
make

That did it for me.

&gt;          $p-&gt;flags = .....
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; of course in C# we would be doing
&gt; 
&gt;       $this += new GParam('propname');
&gt; :)

Or just $this-&gt;install_property()..

I'm updating the zip file on the web site to include the correct compy of
zlib.dll.

It should be available for sownload from
http://gtk.php.net/do_download.php?download_file=php-gtk-1.0.1a-win32.zip
soon.

- Frank

&gt; I'm running "php-gtk 1.0.1 for Windows". The new file libxml2.dll use
&gt; zlib.dll!
&gt; 
&gt; zlib.dll is missing from package "php-gtk-1.0.1-win32.zip"!
&gt; 
&gt; If i insert zlib.dll (from GTK 1.3), the sample script is OK but all
&gt; projects that use "GladeXML" don't works.
&gt; 
&gt; With old libxm2.dll(php-gtk 1.0.0) all is Ok!

Same Problem on SuSE9.1-64Bit.
As I'm not an expert in autoconf, I've no clue how to fix
it. I really would like to play with php-gtk, but since
this bug is open for a while, there is not much hope...
Even the latest cvs-Version is not working...

Hi

While documenting the glade extension I stumbled over signal_autoconnect.

It does not require but allow one parameter; an array.

As I didn't find any other documentation and the php-gtk sources don't 
really help me:

Could someone explain the meaning of this parameter?

Regards/MfG,

Basically it works this  warning: I haven't used this stuff for years!):

As usual you build your GUI in glade and define some handlers for signals, etc. Then \
you load the glade file into PHP-GTK:

 $gx = &amp;new GladeXML( GLADE_XML_GUI_FILE))

and you've also prepared all kinds of functions (== handlers) you already defined in \
the glade file. Now it's time to map the handlers from the glade file to your actualy \
PHP application functions/methods.

This is were signal_autoconnect comes into play. Basically, the parameter is a hash \
in the form of name_of_handler_from_glade_file =&gt; which_php_function_to_call. In real \
source code, this could look like this:

@$gx-&gt;signal_autoconnect( array(
    // main window
    'on_menu_file_quit_activate'            =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this, 'shutdown')),
    'on_mainWindow_destroy'                 =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this, 'shutdown')),
    'on_textSqlIn_key_press_event'          =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this, 'doQuery')),

    // database manager window
    'on_menu_manage_activate'               =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, \
'show')),  'on_windowManageDatabases_delete_event' =&gt;  array( array( \
&amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, 'hide')),  'on_buttonAdd_clicked'                  =&gt;  array( \
array( &amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, 'newConnection')),  'on_buttonApply_clicked'               \
=&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, 'applyChanges')),  \
'on_listConnections_select_row'         =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, \
'configuredConnectionSelected')),  'on_buttonDelete_clicked'               =&gt;  array( \
array( &amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, 'deleteConnection')),  'on_buttonConnect_clicked'          \
=&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this-&gt;notebook, 'addConnection')),  \
'on_statusList_button_press_event'      =&gt;  array( array( &amp;$this-&gt;notebook, \
'selectRow')),  'on_windowAbout_delete_event'           =&gt;  array( array( \
&amp;$this-&gt;aboutDialog, 'hide')),  'on_menu_help_about_activate'           =&gt;  array( \
array( &amp;$this-&gt;aboutDialog, 'show')),  \
'on_windowManageDatabases_key_press_event'=&gt;array( array( &amp;$this-&gt;managerGui, \
'processKeyboardEvents')),  'on_connectionNotebook_switch_page'     =&gt;  array( array( \
&amp;$this-&gt;notebookGui, 'watchPageSwitch')) ));

"on_menu_file_quit_activate", "on_mainWindow_destroy", etc. are all define in the \
glade XML file. Here's a short snip from the glade generated XML file:

      &lt;widget&gt;
        &lt;class&gt;GtkMenuItem&lt;/class&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;menu_file_quit&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;accelerator&gt;
          &lt;modifiers&gt;GDK_CONTROL_MASK&lt;/modifiers&gt;
          &lt;key&gt;GDK_q&lt;/key&gt;
          &lt;signal&gt;activate&lt;/signal&gt;
        &lt;/accelerator&gt;
        &lt;signal&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;activate&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;handler&gt;on_menu_file_quit_activate&lt;/handler&gt;
          &lt;last_modification_time&gt;Sun, 08 Apr 2001 22:38:29 \
GMT&lt;/last_modification_time&gt;  &lt;/signal&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Quit&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;right_justify&gt;False&lt;/right_justify&gt;
      &lt;/widget&gt;
    &lt;/widget&gt;


As you can see, the signal activate is defined to call the handler \
on_menu_file_quit_activate, which is mapped via signal_autoconnect() to the right PHP \
handler.

I think, if your PHP functions are named exactly the way they are named in the glade \
XML file, you don't have to use the array. However, in bigger applications (which \
these snipplets are from, although it never grew over a certain size) you don't want \
to have zillions of global functions; thus you remap them to your dedicated \
objects/methods as you can see in the example above.

I do not remember, why the right part of the hash is an array itself. The syntax is:

signal_autoconnect( array(
'glade_handler' =&gt; array('php_function_to_call'),
));

When you connect to objects, you need to use the array syntax:

signal_autoconnect( array(
'glade_hjandler' =&gt; array( array(&amp;$object, 'method') )
));

However, as stated, I don't remmeber why it's an array at all; maybe it's possible to \
have multitple handlers called.

Attached is an small writing about php-gtk from that time, maybe it's of value to you \
(I've renamed the HTML file to txt in the hope it won't get stripped); it contains \
signal_autoconnect() examples too.

HTH, sincerly,

- Markus

&gt;&gt;&gt; PHP is a software enabling access to a function reference base base 
&gt;&gt;&gt; organised by groups.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ex. Database : MySQL, PgSQL, Oracle
&gt;&gt;&gt;  As far as I know there is no stand alone php mysql project
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why PHP GTK would be one ?
&gt; Probably due to the scale  of the project (mysql has ~20 functions, 
&gt; gtk has &gt; 900)
&gt;
&gt; Merging that kind of documentation into the main manual would not be a 
&gt; good idea..
&gt;

The Idea is not to port every GTK functions because we will get 
problems with WinUI and all other User interface references.
I said that it will be nice to make wrappers for all UI.
The question is : What need a php developper to build him local 
application ?

I do a list of needs. And i found at the moment these few exemple :
Make window.
Change window property
Input, checkbox, listbox and datagrid.
Rendering interface for OpenGL &amp; DirectX  (visual &amp; virtual)
etc...

Concerning the documentation, no problem, it's very easy to make 
documentation of wrappers than 900 GTK functions :)

Let me finish my job on this subject i will present the project php-ui 
in few days to Steph and Andreis.

-mike


&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why shouldn’t we think of a wrapper system that would run with GTK1, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2, Cocoa, Carbon and maybe Windows UI ?
&gt; GTK2 is supposted to be that wrapper system, there are backends for 
&gt; Coca/Win32 etc.
&gt; The only other significant candidate for this is wxWindows.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why shouldn’t we call this project PHP-UI ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed I have been working for six months on a wrapper system, up to 
&gt;&gt;&gt; now, I have drawn what would be necessary to make it
&gt;&gt;&gt; My point is not to discuss what has been done up to now, I just 
&gt;&gt;&gt; think that PHP could have a bigger impact on final developpers. In 
&gt;&gt;&gt; addition, it would make doc creation easier
&gt;
&gt; I've looked at this a number of times, The main reason to use GTK is 
&gt; that it is by far the easiest to write bindings for (it was actually 
&gt; part of the design goal). KDE / wxWindows / Gecko's UI stuff, are all 
&gt; written in C++ and are pretty difficult to write bindings to in 
&gt; comparison.
&gt;
&gt; There was a limited working GTK2/PHP5 branch in CVS, I'm certian it 
&gt; doesnt build with current PHP5, but It probably would not take too 
&gt; much to fix.
&gt;
&gt; The brick wall we ran into before was
&gt; $gtkobject-&gt;style['BG_COLOR'] = new GtkColor('#ffcccc');
&gt; the dereferencing of arrays in the PHP5 objects was not working when I 
&gt; stopped working on it.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; Alan
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I may be wrong but I am open to comments
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you find it fine, I will dedicate some time to work on this 
&gt;&gt;&gt; subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm not saying throw away the present manual there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of useful information there. But the old saying goes "Too

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you look at this widget and document all \ or many of its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties, methods ect according to these guidlines \ standards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; formal methods, or whatever. This work could then be submitted to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a project leader(s) for review which would then be passed back
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for corrections or included into the manual. I'm sure, like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself, many have busy lives but if we work with common aims on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this I think it can be done. Having people randomly work on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sections will not produce a coherant manual - central management
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and review is the key.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Getting any material at all would be pretty key from where I'm 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; standing :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The more complex the process, the less likely you are to see 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through with it.  'Having people randomly work on sections' is 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _exactly_
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the php.net manual guys do; OSS documentation, like OSS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything else,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is better demonstrated by watching a nest-ful of ants retrieve a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teaspoonful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of sugar than by anything else I can think of.  There's already 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there, in the form of other users, in the form of user notes, and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form of peer review (quite a few people have CVS karma for the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manual, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most of them are translators rather than initiators).  It's much 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easier to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get information corrected than it is to get information there in 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place; witness this list, and the amount of flak the PHP-GTK
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manual's taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over the years for incompleteness, versus the amount of people who 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed original material to it.  It's always easier to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; criticise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existing work than it is to produce any.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At php.net nowadays, the docs team request that new functionality 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extensions) are initially documented by the person that wrote that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functionality or extension.  This isn't an option we have here; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrei's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed a couple of classes to the manual (and it took him a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot less
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time than it would've taken me), but we can hardly ask him to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; document 100+
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; classes in his spare time. Even if he had any.  He automated what 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and left the rest for people to fill in.  In other words, at 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; present -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still - if there are no signals and no properties outlined in a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PHP-GTK
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class, it's safe to say that that class has never been touched by 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing documentation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I should maybe make the secondary point that the GTK+ 1.2.* 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; project itself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had the same documentation problems we face here.  That manual was 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completed either.  The documentation for GTK 2 is similarly 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generated but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was better thought through, with the developers getting involved to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce new concepts.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm blathering.  Sorry :)  but all this stuff does need thinking 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before anyone goes to the trouble of setting up an environment 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that won't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get used, or a second manual, or anything along similar lines.

&gt; Bug description:  buildconf is broken

I am having a similar problem with trying to install pdflib.

I am on a Solaris9 box using what should be current 
builds of autoconf, automake, libtool and m4.  I was 
able to get past the stage you are at by installing libtool, but
then I got stuck by the macro expansion of AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.
Getting this error:

configure.in:32: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_BUILDDIR
configure.in:33: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_DIR
configure.in:34: warning: underquoted definition of PHP_EXT_SRCDIR

file or 
directory
autom4te: /usr/local/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 1
aclocal: autom4te failed with exit status: 1

Unfortunately, I am not familiar with autoconf/m4 and am completely stuck
on this as well.  I wish it would tell me what file it thinks its trying
to read.  That would give me someplace to start.  I have been playing 
around getting debugging and verbose output going, but still nothing
obvious telling me where the problem is.  I expect that I will have to get
much more familiar with m4 to figure out whats going on.


&gt; Description:
&gt; ------------
&gt; I have tried moving files around, starting over, getting 
&gt; the lastest automake and auto-conf I have 
&gt; tried ./buildconf aclocal and phpize in many different 
&gt; orders, I have used both php_gtk_new.m4 and php_gtk_old.m4 
&gt; as php_gtk.m4 both produce the same result I have 
&gt; installed GTK 1.6 and 1.9, I can not get ./buildconf to 
&gt; work 

&gt; Expected result:

&gt; ../buildconf makes the configure files, I am very happy

&gt;&gt;We need to make a decision whether to base PHP-GTK 2 on Gtk+ 2.2 or 2.4.
&gt;&gt;The reason is not that 2.4 has different API, but rather that it has
&gt;&gt;more bugfixes and features. It is also what PyGtk supports currently.
&gt;&gt;Thoughts?

Finally got Gtk+ 2.4.4 compiled and installed on my laptop. That thing
eats so much disk space during compilation, it's scary. Anyway, now the
road is (relatively) clear..

Hi

&gt; I have finished implementing all the append/prepend/insert_item/element
&gt; methods of GtkToolbar. They are committed to CVS on PHP_GTK_1 branch.
&gt; Let me know if they work for you okay.
Thanks!
We've got a really usable toolbar now.

Just one thing:
Before I couldn't really test the set_style cause it applies to elements 
created with insert_element, but now I could test it and it doesn't seem 
to work.

I think it crashes with the set_style of GtkWidget, and is not 
overridden. The best thing would be to rename the toolbar's set_style to 
set_toolbar_style to distinguish between the two functions.

Regards/MfG,
Christian Weiske

Description:

Just installed PHP-GTK 1.0.0 on Windows 98.  Don't know the version of
PHP.  Downloaded the hello world script below.  Works fine, but the
default "color" is light grey, covered with dark grey dots.  Also
downloaded a longer sample program.  Again, works fine but with little
grey dots all over it.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php

if (!class_exists('gtk')) {
    if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0,3) == 'WIN'))
    dl('php_gtk.dll');
  else
    dl('php_gtk.so');
}

function delete_event()
{
    return false;
}

function shutdown()
{
    print("Shutting down...\n");
    gtk::main_quit();
}

function hello()
{
    global $window;
    print "Hello World!\n";
    $window-&gt;destroy();
}

$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'shutdown');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$window-&gt;set_border_width(10);

$button = &amp;new GtkButton('Hello World!');
$button-&gt;connect('clicked', 'hello');
$window-&gt;add($button);

$window-&gt;show_all();

gtk::main();

?&gt;


Expected result:
----------------
A little window with a button saying hello world, but without little
dark grey spots all over it.

Actual result:
--------------
Could send a screen shot,

&gt; Determined that this is not a problem if the display mode is set to
&gt; 32-bit color rather than 16-bit.  Unfortunately, some Windows software
&gt; doesn't work in 32-bit, so this is still a problem.

I'm running a Linux box (Fedora Core 2), and I was working with the 
GtkFileSelection dialog, testing it and whatnot, when I stumbled across 
something rather odd.  I created a file and chown'd it to root.  Then, 
as a normal user, I opened the root-owned file using the 
GtkFileSelection dialog, and then, I opened the dialog again, chose the 
file, and clicked the delete button in the dialog.  It prompted me as to 
whether I wanted to delete it.  So, just to test it, I chose "Delete." 
It deleted the file.

I have tried it again with another file owned by root.  It continues to 
delete it.  It should not allow me to delete the file, but it is 
deleting it nonetheless.

BTW, I'm running PHP 4.3.7, if that makes a difference.

Well, isn't that weird.  So, if a root-owned file is in a directory that 
user has access to, it will allow user to delete it?  I didn't know that 
because I had never tried to do it.

Thanks for the info.

Scott, congratulations!  I think you found a PHP-GTK bug.

  attributes.event_mask = gtk_widget_get_events (widget);
  attributes.event_mask |= (GDK_EXPOSURE_MASK |
			    GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK |
			    GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK |
			    GDK_BUTTON1_MOTION_MASK |
			    GDK_BUTTON3_MOTION_MASK |
			    GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK |
			    GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK |
                            GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY_MASK |
			    GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY_MASK);
(from gtkentry.c, around line 1000 in my - admittedly GTK 2 - copy)

- that's where the event_masks for the widgets are originally set.  So
there's your list for GtkEntry, at least..

The notes for gtk_widget_get_events itself say:
 * gtk_widget_get_events:
 * @widget: a #GtkWidget
 *
 * Returns the event mask for the widget (a bitfield containing flags
 * from the #GdkEventMask enumeration). These are the events that the widget
 * will receive.

All I get here from var_dump($widget-&gt;get_events()); is int[0].

You can either trawl through GTK src looking for attributes.event_mask, or
you could steal the bit of PHP-GTK code from the signals/events chapter in
the manual and play with the widgets to see what you get.  I don't know if
there's any point in putting in a bug report at this stage, everyone's busy
with PHP 5 development and will then be straight onto PHP-GTK 2.. but
copying this to the dev list anyway so everyone knows it's there.

Sorry,
- Steph

It seems get_events() only returns what has been set previously by
set_events() or add_events() so it would seem safe to set whatever
events you want after creating the widget and then modify them later
if needed. Can't find any way to get what the eventmask is set to by
the widget itself (unless of course it is 0 :)

Description:
------------
Just installed PHP-GTK 1.0.0 on Windows 98.  Don't know the version of
PHP.  Downloaded the hello world script below.  Works fine, but the
default "color" is light grey, covered with dark grey dots.  Also
downloaded a longer sample program.  Again, works fine but with little
grey dots all over it.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php

if (!class_exists('gtk')) {
    if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0,3) == 'WIN'))
    dl('php_gtk.dll');
  else
    dl('php_gtk.so');
}

function delete_event()
{
    return false;
}

function shutdown()
{
    print("Shutting down...\n");
    gtk::main_quit();
}

function hello()
{
    global $window;
    print "Hello World!\n";
    $window-&gt;destroy();
}

$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'shutdown');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$window-&gt;set_border_width(10);

$button = &amp;new GtkButton('Hello World!');
$button-&gt;connect('clicked', 'hello');
$window-&gt;add($button);

$window-&gt;show_all();

gtk::main();

?&gt;


Expected result:
----------------
A little window with a button saying hello world, but without little
dark grey spots all over it.

Actual result:
--------------
Could send a screen shot,

Yep, the ones that work for the PHP build system. php-src/buildconf
works like a charm, that's why I was surprised that php-gtk/buildconf
doesn't.

&gt;  What versions?

$ autoconf --version

We need to make a decision whether to base PHP-GTK 2 on Gtk+ 2.2 or 2.4.
The reason is not that 2.4 has different API, but rather that it has
more bugfixes and features. It is also what PyGtk supports currently.
Thoughts?

While I don't use PHP-GTK at all ( currently using Perl Gtk2, but 
watching this mailing list... ), I strongly recommend you use Gtk+ 2.4.
There are a number of improvements that make life far easier, eg the 
GtkComboBoxEntry is WAY better than the 2.2 version ( can base the 2.4 
version on a Gtk2 Liststore ).

Hi


&gt; We need to make a decision whether to base PHP-GTK 2 on Gtk+ 2.2 or 2.4.
&gt; The reason is not that 2.4 has different API, but rather that it has
&gt; more bugfixes and features. It is also what PyGtk supports currently.
&gt; Thoughts?
I think 2.4 will become stable sooner or later - and the we would have a 
nice 2.2 php-gtk, but say that it'd be better if we'd chosen the 2.4.
I vote for 2.4, cause life goes on.

Me too..

But this is not unusual.  It's doing exactly what the operating system
lets it do.  The directory ownership counts for more.

Example:

host:~$ touch test-file
host:~$ ls -l test-file
-rw-r--r--    1 user     user            0 Jun 10 13:46 test-file

Password: 
host:/home/user# chown root:root test-file

exit
host:~$ ls -l test-file
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Jun 10 13:46 test-file

It seems that everyone I heard from voted for 2.4. Very well. Now if I
could only install 2.4 on my laptop.. :-) It requires libXinerama.so.1
which is apparently provided only by new xorg-X11-libs RPM, not the
older XFree86-libs one. And that means I need to redo my whole X Windows
install. Argh.

Hi Frank, happy new year etc!

It occurs to me that it ought to be possible to adapt Wez's shiny new PHP5
build system across to PHP-GTK2, which might make it possible to port
changes and additions across to win32 more quickly and easily than going the
full MSVC route.

So I'm fiddling away trying to build the latest GTK+ from src, and as ever
have fallen at the first hurdle because I can't stop glib wanting to use
libc.lib alongside msvcrt.lib, regardless of the flags I add to the nmake
commandline.  I thought this might be because there's a static library
produced alongside the glib dll, but commenting out the static build didn't
help at all.

ftp.gnu.org appears broken for the last couple of days so I can't cheat and
download the pre-made binaries Tor advocates on his site.

Can you assist?

Steph

Okay. Firstly, can you try running 'aclocal' and then autoconf manually
and see if it still complains? Secondly, try upgrading to automake 1.6.3
maybe? That's what I have on my system.

aaahhhhh the #define for G_GSIZE_FORMAT and friend are missing!

The 'original' config file has this define:

case $glib_size_type in
short)
  gsize_modifier='"h"'
  gsize_format='"hu"'
  gssize_format='"hi"'
  ;;
int)
  gsize_modifier='""'
  gsize_format='"u"'
  gssize_format='"i"'
  ;;
long)
  gsize_modifier='"l"'
  gsize_format='"lu"'
  gssize_format='"li"'
  ;;
esac

where $glib_size_type is the type returned by sizeof(size_t).

We could run into problems over this one, glib's configure doesn't give the
option for 64-bit support.
#define GLIB_SIZEOF_SIZE_T 4

I added the following lines to glibconfig.h and glibconfig.h.win32 at line
73 (copy happens too late for gnulib build)
#define G_GSIZE_FORMAT "lu"
#define G_GSSIZE_FORMAT "li"

This fixes the test build problems, I'm just stuck on the lack of
libintl/libiconv linkage now.

Description:
------------
The "node_get_cell_style" of the GtkCTree widget does not work, it just
returns NULL. The same problem should apply to the GtkCList.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
dl( "php_gtk." . ( strstr( PHP_OS, "WIN") ? "dll" : "so"));
function delete_event() { return false; }
function destroy() { Gtk::main_quit(); }
$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_default_size( 200, 200);
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'destroy');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$tree	= &amp;new GtkCTree( 1, 0, array( "Style"));
$window-&gt;add( $tree);
$window-&gt;show_all();

$node	= $tree-&gt;insert_node( null, null, array( "Text"), 5, null, null,
null, null, false, false);
$nodestyle	= $tree-&gt;node_get_cell_style( $node, 0);
print_r( $nodestyle);//should be NOT null
$col1 = &amp;new GdkColor(0, 56000, 0);
$nodestyle-&gt;base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL] = $col1;
$tree-&gt;node_set_cell_style( $node, 0, $nodestyle);
Gtk::main();
?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
the cell style of the first tree cell should have a nice color

 New Comment:

Actually it's returning a stdClass instead of a GtkStyle object - but
only if the style hasn't been set using node_set_cell_style().  It
looks like the style object isn't being initialised at the point of
realization. The question is whether this is deliberate :)  I'm still
trying to verify this, one way or the other.

BTW you're correct in assuming that the GtkCList equivalent works in
much the same way; they use the same internal objects way deep in the
mix (clistrow, cell).

There's still a bug report open on PHP_GTK_1 at
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=26067

I've looked at it and come to the conclusion that it's probably a 'won't
fix' - am I very wrong in assuming there'd have to be a clistrow-&gt;cell
property and some PHP-GTK wrapper for gtk_cell to make this work in the way
it should?

I've given up trying to get my head around it, but have attached a minor
patch to kill the final two win32 compile warnings.

I only discovered it _after_ I had ripped all my hair out... Anyways... 
I have learned something :)

I had a quick look at what you did (dont be surprised if some of the 
test code looks familiar!), but didnt get it to work (I think that the 
embeded support was pretty ropey until version 1.4.1).

Most of the stuff autogenerated, I only really needed to override the 
_new function, to load the component and profile paths, which is what I 
need to have a look at really, I think that I will need to add the 
component and/or profile path to the constructor.  Then add some way to 
specify the mozilla include and lib dirs (mozilla seems to like wierd 
non-standard installations - my include dir is 
/usr/include/mozilla-1.3.1 , and the 'install' dir is 
/usr/lib/mozilla-1.3.1 with a link from /usr/lib/mozilla) The 
gtkembedmoz.h file seems to float around between different versions of 
mozilla.

&gt;&gt; Most of the main functions and callbacks seem to work correctly, and I

&gt;&gt; To compile, you will need to uncompress the archive to your

&gt;&gt; mozembed.overrides to match your system.  Then (in your root php-gtk

&gt;&gt; make &amp;&amp; make install.  You should be able to run the test mozembed.php.

 ID:               26067
 Updated by:       andrei@php.net
 Reported By:      cweiske at cweiske dot de
 Status:           Analyzed
 Bug Type:         PHP-GTK related
 Operating System: windows xp
 PHP Version:      4.3.3
 New Comment:

By default the CTreeNodes do not have styles set. There are couple of
things wrong with your script, consequently. You have to create a new
style via "new GtkStyle()". Then you have to allocate the color
correctly, by getting a colormap and using alloc() call on it. I
modified the code to do that and it worked.

Actually it's returning a stdClass instead of a GtkStyle object - but
only if the style hasn't been set using node_set_cell_style().  It
looks like the style object isn't being initialised at the point of
realization. The question is whether this is deliberate :)  I'm still
trying to verify this, one way or the other.

BTW you're correct in assuming that the GtkCList equivalent works in
much the same way; they use the same internal objects way deep in the
mix (clistrow, cell).


------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2004-01-17 11:34:39] sfox@php.net

Apologies Christian, I didn't notice this report was outstanding until
today's bug summary came through.  

Looking into it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2003-11-01 00:25:50] cweiske at cweiske dot de

Description:
------------
The "node_get_cell_style" of the GtkCTree widget does not work, it just
returns NULL. The same problem should apply to the GtkCList.

Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
dl( "php_gtk." . ( strstr( PHP_OS, "WIN") ? "dll" : "so"));
function delete_event() { return false; }
function destroy() { Gtk::main_quit(); }
$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();
$window-&gt;set_default_size( 200, 200);
$window-&gt;connect('destroy', 'destroy');
$window-&gt;connect('delete-event', 'delete_event');
$tree	= &amp;new GtkCTree( 1, 0, array( "Style"));
$window-&gt;add( $tree);
$window-&gt;show_all();

$node	= $tree-&gt;insert_node( null, null, array( "Text"), 5, null, null,
null, null, false, false);
$nodestyle	= $tree-&gt;node_get_cell_style( $node, 0);
print_r( $nodestyle);//should be NOT null
$col1 = &amp;new GdkColor(0, 56000, 0);
$nodestyle-&gt;base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL] = $col1;
$tree-&gt;node_set_cell_style( $node, 0, $nodestyle);
Gtk::main();
?&gt;

Expected result:
----------------
the cell style of the first tree cell should have a nice color



------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Step,

Happy new year to you too.

&gt; It occurs to me that it ought to be possible to adapt Wez's shiny new
PHP5
&gt; build system across to PHP-GTK2, which might make it possible to port
&gt; changes and additions across to win32 more quickly and easily than going
the
&gt; full MSVC route.

That should be possible. I was thinking the same, but did'nt have time to
try it yet.

&gt; So I'm fiddling away trying to build the latest GTK+ from src, and as
ever
&gt; have fallen at the first hurdle because I can't stop glib wanting to
use
&gt; libc.lib alongside msvcrt.lib, regardless of the flags I add to the
nmake
&gt; commandline.  I thought this might be because there's a static library
&gt; produced alongside the glib dll, but commenting out the static build
didn't
&gt; help at all.

I thiunk we need to rebuild all the GTK binaries from scratch. PHP5 now
comes with libxml2 and iconv bundled and with all the symbols exported.
There is no need to link with these any more.  This will also allow us to
build everything with the /MD options so we avoid the LIBC linking
problems.
I have two important projects on my plate right now; a new product that we
release at the end of January and my talk for the Vancouver conference. As
soon as I get the time I'll start working on this.

I have finally managed to get the MozEmbed widget ( 
http://www.mozilla.org/unix/gtk-embedding.html ) working with php-gtk.

It took a while, but I was surprised by how much is auto generated.  I 
have managed to get it up and working on my system using a fresh mozilla 
1.4.1 build, it segfaults with version 1.3.1.

Most of the main functions and callbacks seem to work correctly, and I 
can make a test browser.

I am not a very good c coder and therefore, the code has a lot of hard 
coded file locations (in config.m4 and mozembed.overrides)

I have uploaded the files here

http://www.dransfield7565.fsnet.co.uk/GtkMozEmbed.tar.gz

To compile, you will need to uncompress the archive to your php-gtk/ext 
directory, then change the directories in config.m4 and 
mozembed.overrides to match your system.  Then (in your root php-gtk 
source dir) type ./buildconf, then ./configure --enable-mozembed &amp;&amp; make 
&amp;&amp; make install.  You should be able to run the test mozembed.php.

I would appreaciate any comments/help on making this better, with the 
intention on having it included in the distribution (if any more will be 
released).

I _am_ building everything with the /MD options...  I've ended up putting
/nodefaultlib:libc against the glib.2.0.lib output, which takes most of the
problem away but leaves 3 unresolved externals emanating from the versions
of iconv.lib and intl.lib I built here.  Guess I'll just have to wait for
gnu.org to sort out their server troubles..

&gt; There is no need to link with these any more.

Good thinking.  .oO('how do we build glib at that level?')

OK, I did this with glib-2.3.1:
glib\build\win32\make.msc
# INTL_CFLAGS = -I $(INTL)
# INTL_LIBS = $(INTL)\intl.lib

# LIBICONV_CFLAGS = -I $(LIBICONV)\include
# LIBICONV_LIBS = $(LIBICONV)\lib\iconv.lib

PHP_CFLAGS = -I $(PHP) # this is most likely wrong?
PHP_LIBS = $(PHP)\Release_TS\php5ts.lib

and replaced those macros where appropriate throughout the glib makefiles.
I also had to replace gmacros.h, gconvert.h and gconvert.c in glib\glib dir
with the latest CVS versions.

Relevant MSVC output:

I don't know why I'm getting those unresolved external symbols for libiconv

fairly hopeful apart from that!

Hi!

Sometimes I've asked me, whats the difference between the 
php_gtk.exe and the php_win.exe.

So, the difference is only that the php_gtk.exe is also 
aviable to make associations to the file name extension 
*.php-gtk. Or is there any other feature I don't know 
about?

For the php_win.exe I asked myself why there is so much 
source code when somethin like the following should work 
also..

&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt;#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
&gt;#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
&gt;
&gt;#define EXE_FILENAME "phpgtk.exe"
&gt;
&gt;void basedir(char *path, char *buffer, int buffer_size)
&gt;{
&gt;  char res[buffer_size], cache[buffer_size]; 
&gt;  int pos=0, len=0;
&gt;  //Length of path..
&gt;  len = strlen(path)-strlen(EXE_FILENAME);
&gt;  //Put firs character to res..
&gt;  sprintf(res, "%c%", path[0]);
&gt;  //Cache chars to lenght of path..
&gt;  for(pos=1;pos&lt;len;pos++)
&gt;  {
&gt;    sprintf(res, "%s%c", res, path[pos]);
&gt;  }
&gt;  //return result..
&gt;  strcpy(buffer, res); 
&gt;}
&gt;     
&gt;int main(int argc, char *argv[])
&gt;{
&gt;  char dir[500], php_file[500], php_path[500];
&gt;  //The paths..
&gt;  basedir(argv[0], php_path, 500);
&gt;  sprintf(php_path, "\"%s\\php.exe\"", php_path);
&gt;  strcpy(php_file, argv[1]);
&gt;  //Run it..
&gt;  ShellExecute(NULL, NULL, php_path, php_file, NULL, SW_HIDE);
&gt;  return 0;
&gt;}
(not tested yet)

So, please help me: Why and When it's better to use one of 
those (php_gtk/php_win.exe)? I don't understand :-/

Sorry if my question is absurd, but was confused about 
this..

Hi Florian,

&gt; Sometimes I've asked me, whats the difference between the php_gtk.exe 
&gt; and the php_win.exe.
php_gtk.exe has, like you said, the ability to associate .php-gtk files 
with php.
The other thing is that php_win.exe didn't find my php.exe (as I used to 
install applications not in standard locations), but didn't look in the 
folder where itself was located - php_gtk.exe does.

Short: php_win.exe doesn't work in some cases, and php_gtk.exe does.

Hi,

php_win.exe is included in the official winows distribution of PHP-GTK.
php_gtk.exe is not. php_win.exe should work in all cases, if not I'll be
happy to fix bugs.

When we get a PHP5 version of PHP-GTK there will no longer be a need for a
special php_win.exe. PHP5 for win32 compes with php-win.exe (note the dash
and not underscore). This will allow us to execute PHP-GTK scripts without
the command line wiindow.

Hi!

So, do you want to tell us with this, that in the php5 
distribution the php-win.exe would be a mod of the 
php.exe, or what?

By the way: I've seen that Photoshop is dynamically 
rendering Icons for its *.psd files which will be shown in 
the explorer. I think it would be nice to implement 
something like this to the PHP-Gkt2 windows version. At

&gt;&gt; Hi Florian,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sometimes I've asked me, whats the difference between 
&gt;&gt;the php_gtk.exe
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; and the php_win.exe.
&gt;&gt; php_gtk.exe has, like you said, the ability to associate 
&gt;&gt;.php-gtk files
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; with php.
&gt;&gt; The other thing is that php_win.exe didn't find my 
&gt;&gt;php.exe (as I used to
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; install applications not in standard locations), but 
&gt;&gt;didn't look in the
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; folder where itself was located - php_gtk.exe does.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Short: php_win.exe doesn't work in some cases, and 
&gt;&gt;php_gtk.exe does.
&gt;&gt;

Hi,

&gt; So, do you want to tell us with this, that in the php5 
&gt; distribution the php-win.exe would be a mod of the 
&gt; php.exe, or what?

Yes that's the case. php.exe and php-win.exe are both SAPI modules in
PHP5. They use two different methods to launch the program, main() and
WinMain(). This causes the command line to be visible with php.exe and not
with php-win.exe.

&gt; By the way: I've seen that Photoshop is dynamically 
&gt; rendering Icons for its *.psd files which will be shown in 
&gt; the explorer. I think it would be nice to implement 
&gt; something like this to the PHP-Gkt2 windows version. At 
&gt; moment I don't know how it works exactly, but I think this 
&gt; can be discovered.
&gt; What do you think about this?

That's already the case. If you associate your script files (.php) with
php.exe or php-win.exe in PHP5 you will get a small PHP logo. If you use
php_win.exe you will get a php-gtk logo.

Hi! I dont mean that. Photoshop provides different logos 
for each *.psd file which is based on some meta 
informations of the file itself.
So for example if you got a file 'foo.psd' with a 
500x500dot matrix in white, the icon of the file 'foo.psd' 
is shown as a white matrix only. If you got a file 
'bar.psd' with a 700x300dot matrix and to crossing layers 
in it, it will show a protract cross as icon.
You know what I whant to tell? The *.psd file itself 
defines the Icon it gots, so each *.psd file got their on 
icon such like the exe files have got.

Hi Florian,

That would require embedding the binary image into the ascii PHP file.
That would not be possible. The .psd files are binary files, managed by
Photoshop and not by a text editor.

You can change the desktop icon (manually) for any file by rightclicking
on it, selecting properties and clicking on change icon. I guess you could
write a program (or a PHP script) to do this automated, but I have no plans
to add this to PHP or PHP-GTK.

Hi!
Generally, yes! But I think it should be possible to 
embedd such a managing function like phtoshop has it got 
into the php-gtk.exe(or what ever). But then it is 
required to implement a algorythm to generate the binary 
icon source by given datas which are readable by humans, 
in this case I think it would be practiable to use XPM_d 
arrays for this.
So, if the php-gtk.exe would extract the XPM_d from the 
php file and use this to generate source for the icon it 
could work as well. That what I've thought on when writing 
this down..

And yes, I know that this will bring some problems and 
isn't the easyiest feature to implement, but it's just a 
train of thoughts for now..

&gt; That would require embedding the binary image into the 
&gt;ascii PHP file.

&gt;files, managed by

Hi all and excuse me for the banal question just for a newbie.
I'm curious to know better about the work of binding language like PHP-GTk.
I'm newbie in the software-engine and i want an impression just for overview
about the work
to develop the interface between the sintax of PHP and library of GTk.
I have suppose that a sintax of PHP coming translate to a C sintax to work on
particular widget 
that code regard like button clist and other...
At this point the new version work correcty with either sintax of language PHP4
and PHP5 ? It's right.
Can you explain me ? Thaks so much and sorry for my bad english.

Hi,

Embedding it into any of the php binaries (php.exe or php-win.exe) wold
not do you any good. You are not using any of these files to edit the
content of the php scripts. The OS will not execute the associated
executable to figure out which icon to show with a script file. Changing
the icon has to be done by the editor or some external program that
informas the OS what icon to show. This external program could be the
installer.

In the case of PhostShop, the exe file is the editor and it has full
control over the content of the file and can instruct the OS to look for a
bitmap inside that file or in any other file installed with the program.

&gt; &gt; Sounds good.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But I think instead of the MARC url 
&gt; &gt; http://news.php.net/php.gtk.general/5178 should be used, because it 
&gt; &gt; looks better when the url is from php.net and also the page style of

&gt; 
&gt; It really doesn't make any difference to me, but MARC is the archive

Hello,

I was thinking it's probably a good idea to have a news blurb at least 
once a month to keep things looking lively. The last news item was 
November 12th, so it's about time for more. Is there anything news 
worthy to report for the last month? PHP-Gtk in the news anywhere? Any 
applications have new release worth noting?

Thanks,

Hi Scott,

I'm not sure if this is the kind of news you're looking for, but it's

and it's new. I'm one of the developers on the Roadsend Compiler for PHP
project, and we've just finished an initial implementation of a GTK binding
which aims to be compatible with PHP-GTK. It will be available as part of
the next release of the compiler which should come in just a couple days.

Hope that helps.

&gt;&gt; least once a month to keep things looking lively. The last news item 
&gt;&gt; was November 12th, so it's about time for more. Is there anything 
&gt;&gt; news worthy to report for the last month? PHP-Gtk in the news 
&gt;&gt; anywhere? Any applications have new release worth noting?

&gt; I don't know that there is much to add aside from what is on the wiki.

I think there's going to be an article on one company's use of PHP-GTK 
in the 01.2005 issue of International PHP Magazine. It's scheduled to 
hit newsstands on December 14th. I didn't write the article, but I read 
it a while back. It's pretty interesting, and I'd suggest checking it 
out when it comes out.

I've been pretty busy lately with all my other projects, so I haven't 
had a chance to catch up on things going on with PHP-GTK of late. How 
are things going with 2.0?

Ok. So here is what I have for December news:

Ben mentioned an article about PHP-Gtk usage in companies. It looks like 
it didn't make it though.

Madeline asked to point out the php-gtk-general thread about PHP-Gtk use 
in companies.

Nate pointed out that Roadsend can now compile PHP-Gtk apps to run 
without an installed version of PHP-Gtk on a user's computer.

I got an email today saying that the International PHP Confernce has put 
out a call for papers and one of the topics they are looking for is PHP-Gtk.

We also have a new Russian version of the docs. (The docs page needs to 
be updated though.)

Combining all of this glorious news I have come up with the following 
news item. Please feel free to make comments, suggestions, point out 
other items or completely rewrite it. Links need to be added but I 
figured the first version can leave them out for readability's sake.

PHP-Gtk in business
There has been a lot of discusson lately about the role PHP-Gtk can and 
is playing in the business world. Several people have commented on the 
php-gtk-general mailing list about how they have developed secure, 
cross-platform applications for use in business with PHP-Gtk. Using 
tools such as Roadsend's PHP Compiler, developers are able to create and 
distribute PHP-Gtk applications that don't require the user to have a 
working installation first.

On the international level, PHP-Gtk documentation is now available in 
Russian thanks to the work of Andrew Krasnyansky. Also, the organizers 
of the International PHP Conference have put out a call for papers. One 
of the requested topics is PHP-Gtk.

Hi Scott,


&gt; On the international level, PHP-Gtk documentation is now available in 
&gt; Russian thanks to the work of Andrew Krasnyansky. Also, the organizers 
I would think that "php-gtk documentation is being translated to Russian 
thanks to..." would be better - it's just few pages now.

Hi!
Sounds good.

But I think instead of the MARC url 
http://news.php.net/php.gtk.general/5178 should be used, 
because it looks better when the url is from php.net and 
also the page style of MARC isn't the best to read 
something.

It really doesn't make any difference to me, but MARC is the archive 
listed on the site. Just for the sake of consistency I think it should 
stay as is. Can someone with the right karma post the blurb to the 
homepage?

Thanks,
