I fixed this in CVS. Now the selection, target, and type properties of \
GtkSelectionData are GdkAtom objects and you have to cast them to (string) in order \
to get the string representation. Let me know if this is going to be too cumbersome. \
I may adjust GtkSelectionData to have just strings instead of GdkAtom objects for \
properties.

Also, when running your example the 'data' property is NULL. Is that normal?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006-05-03 18:31:09] cweiske@php.net

Description:
------------
Bug in drag'n'drop:
Drag from "from" button to "to" button.
You will get a segfault.


Reproduce code:
---------------
&lt;?php
$wnd = new GtkWindow();
$wnd-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('Gtk', 'main_quit'));
$hbox = new GtkHBox();
$wnd-&gt;add($hbox);

$btnFrom = new GtkButton('From');
$btnTo   = new GtkButton('To');

$hbox-&gt;pack_start($btnFrom);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($btnTo);

$btnFrom-&gt;drag_source_set(
    Gdk::BUTTON1_MASK,
    //change to text/plain, and it works
    array(array('text/xml', 0, 1)),
    Gdk::ACTION_COPY | Gdk::ACTION_MOVE
);
$btnFrom-&gt;connect('drag-data-get', 'onGetDragData');


$btnTo-&gt;drag_dest_set(
    Gtk::DEST_DEFAULT_ALL,
    //change to text/plain, and it works
    array(array('text/xml', 0, 1)),
    Gdk::ACTION_COPY | Gdk::ACTION_MOVE
);

function onGetDragData($widget, $context, $selection, $info, $time) {
    var_dump($selection);
}


$wnd-&gt;show_all();
Gtk::main();
?&gt;

Actual result:
--------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Freebirds Happy Hour menu takes one of their most sought-after menu items and offers \
it at a price that is nearly 2 dollars less than their usual cost. What this means \
for people who dine in the afternoon and evening is that you'll get to get the most \
value for money Freebird offers without paying more for it.
