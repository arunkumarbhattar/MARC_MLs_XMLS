Hello there,

I have a problem with my portable, which I believe only ACPI could help me with. 

The problem is that my Armada 1700 notebook, which has a ACPI BIOS, has also a Infrared port.
This port is a SMC IrCC, which is part of a SMC FDC37C95xFR Ultra IO controller. This IO chip
also supports ACPI, and this seems to be my problem.

Here is what happens:

The regular PnP BIOS reports the IR port as a generic SIR (up to 115200 bps) port. SIR ports
works just like regular serial ports, that is, it only takes a IO address and IRQ as
resources, and so the BIOS PnP just allows me to select this resources. The way it is, Linux
sees the port at 0x3e8, and IRQ , which is shared with ttyS0 when it boots. No problem here.

When I enable ACPI, the system stops detecting a generic SIR port, and starts detecting the
port as a SMC IrCC. I've seen it starts using *SMCF010 instead of the generic PnP ID.

The problem is that if I want to use the port at higher speeds, I am expected to use other IO
address, and a DMA (only available when the port is detected as the SMC IrCC). But when the
system is turned on, it is set to use DMA 0, IO 0x100. But the address 0x100 is also used by
some mainboard resources (Windows 98 reports them as ACPI mainboard resources).

So what happens? using Windows 98, it will reconfigure it (through ACPI I guess) the port to
use 0x110 automagically, but I don't know how could I do that in Linux.

Is there a program that could reconfigure enumerated devices? I've checked the ACPI
specification, but I found that very confusing. 

I know the ACPI support is rather primitive right now and wonder if that
could be done in a user space utility.

This tests with device enumeration were done in Windows 98 (regular PnP BIOS vs ACPI enabled). 
Other devices also changed IDs when ACPI was enabled, like serial and parallel ports.

I've tried with the latest 2.3 kernel, and it could detect that my system has ACPI. I could
then grep the SMCF010 ID in the tables.

Can someone share some light with me?

Thanks in advance,

In case of resource conflicting, ACPI OS should be a resource arbitator.

get possible resources from _PRS,
and find free resources which can be used with the device, (This may be most dificcult point)
the set appropriate resource by _SRS method.
then make sure that resource setting is correctly done by _CRS.


I'm sorry but I don't know current kernel or user space utility supports
dynamic resource allocation.

Hi All!

I'm kindof new to this ACPI stuff, I'll admit that I only really was interested
due to the attraction of power off.

I'm running 2.2.14.  I grabbed one of the older patches for 2.2.11 from the
website, as it was the latest one against the 2.2 kernels.  With a bit of
hand-tweaking I adapted it (2.2.14 had a few #includes added).

Would this simple tweaking be enough to fit one of the more recent patches
which are diffed against the 2.3 kernels?  Or are the 2.3 kernels sufficiently
different from 2.2 at this stage to make it practical?

Also, I would be interested in making a patch against 2.2.14 available (even if
it was the older one that I am using).  Given that I have a 'pure' 2.2.14
kernel source in one directory and a patched 'pure' source in another, what
command can I use to make this patch?

Thanks in advance

I am sorry for my multiple broken email due to incorrect character set. :)


I have a linux server which has dual PIII-550 and intel L440GX+ M/B built in intel \
82559 ethernet controller.

I have installed 2.3.99-pre5 for ACPI.
I run the "acpid -d" in prompt.
I can shutdown the server and power off without pushing the power button.

Everything is ok but I can't wake the system with wake-on-lan.

When I use 2.2.14 kernel, I have no problem to wake up the system with wake-on-lan.

How can I catch two rabbits?

Right, wake-on-lan is not currently implemented.
There is a fair amount of work still to do to get
that working, so it might be a while.

I would be very surprised if you are seeing
wake-on-lan working on 2.2.14.  There is a patch
that adds some ACPI support to a 2.2.x kernel but
it only provides power-off and power button support.
And AFAIK the ethernet driver side of wake-on-lan
is totally absent from 2.2.x

No, sorry, there isn't even alpha WOL support
right now.  The first step to WOL is ACPI suspend
and resume support on Linux and that is not yet
complete.  The gating factor is completion and
debug of the AML interpreter (currently contained
in acpid).  Once that is solid, suspend/resume
and WOL will soon follow.

I try to get new ACPI code out to the Linux
community as soon as it is available, so there
really is no early development tree.  Keep
watching the ACPI4Linux mailing list for progress
updates.

Does your message mean that I couldn't wake up the system with WOL in the current ACPI4Linux?

Without ACPI, I can wake up the system!

Can I change the same system status with no ACPI when I shutdown with ACPI?

Hi Andy

   I found this patch on the Linux kernel ML. In case, you've missed
it, I post it here. Any comments about that peace of code (I haven't
tried it yet)?

Subject: Power off handling.
Date: Tue, 11 Jan 2000 03:37:02 GMT
From: David Woodhouse &lt;dwmw2@infradead.org&gt;
Organization: Internet mailing list
To: torvalds@transmeta.com
CC: linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
Newsgroups: fa.linux.kernel

This patch uses a notifier chain to register a list of functions which
ought 
to be able to power the machine down, and provides a generic 
machine_power_off() routine which calls them in turn until one of them 
succeeds.

This means that when both acpi and apm are present on a machine, it
can 
attempt both ways to power down.

It removes the unnecessary sysrq_power_off pointer, and sysrq-o now
calls 
machine_power_off instead.

Nope, not other than trying it and sending me
a bug report if your system has a broken ACPI
implementation.  There are obviously still plenty
of broken implementations post 1/1/1999

&gt;  And: How can I use ACPI in real life at the moment?
&gt; It seems to like like it's just a playground for
&gt; developers but on the other side if it's enabled in
&gt; the kernel APM automatically gets overridden, so
&gt; laptop users would be rather silly to activate ACPI
&gt; at the moment because the system will empty the
&gt; battery really fast.

Actually, if you are running acpid, you'll get
a fair amount of power savings from ACPI C-states
(low power when the system is idle, like an
improved "hlt")  So, no, you definitely will not
be draining the battery any faster than if you
were using APM.

The issue with ACPI support right now is that
you don't get battery status or suspend
capability.  The former is fairly easy to do
and is coming along soon in acpid.  The later
requires signficant changes to drivers and
probably the kernel and is going to take a bit.

I've successfully compiled the acpid (both release and CVS).
&gt;From what my kernel tells, my board is acpi-capable:

As many of you have already noticed, a lot of ACPI
code (the entire interpreter) has been included in
the latest development kernel (2.4.0-test3) as
experimental.

I have been scrambling for a bit to put together
this patch for Linus but didn't reasonably expect
him to accept it on the first go.  Well, he did
and it's there now.

This means there will be fairly big changes on
the way for acpid.  Namely, 95% of the code will
go away and acpid will basically just be handling
ACPI events (ie. power/sleep button) for now.
Also, the interface to the ACPI driver in
/proc/sys/acpi/ has changed a bit.

So, for now, if you use the latest development
kernel and turn on the ACPI interpreter, don't use
acpid (until I update it).  I apologize for the
temporary pain, but this change may mean that
many systems that have been having problems with
power-off and sleep may begin to work soon.

Longer-term, the interpreter in the kernel will allow
us to do a lot of things that couldn't be done
with the user-space interpreter such as deeper
sleep (eg. suspend-to-disk) and system initialization
and configuration (eg. boot IA-64 systems without
the current boot loader hack)  There will also not
be nearly as much reliance on acpid moving forward,
which is good in that it cleans up a lot of the
interface ugliness that is there now.  Thermal and
battery, for example, will be able to be handled
entirely from within the kernel.

I will get that updated acpid out soon.  As always,
keep playing with the code and forward bug reports
to me and to the mailing list.

Thanks,
Andy

&gt; Ok you have basic ACPI system support but since ACPI
&gt; is disabled there isn't much other knowledge about
&gt; your system that can be gleaned.
&gt; 
&gt; This just makes me itch to write a "native" power
&gt; management driver for PIIX4, and do things
&gt; properly. :/

Actually, you can't really do much direct to
the chipset.  C-states and events, that's about
it.  No S-states (suspend), no device specific
stuff, no battery, no thermal, etc.  If you
recall, Linus started out doing a PIIX4-specific
driver some time ago and that code ended up being
merged into the current ACPI driver.

 An Mobile P-II even drains the battery a fair lot if
 halting the CPU. I'd like to have "suspend to ram",
 "suspend to disk", controlling the backlight of the LCD
 (if nothing or apmd is running it'll turn at least off 
 after the timeout time set in BIOS and when the notebook
 is shut. When running acpid I get nothing!), intelligent
 harddisk management and more...

&gt; The issue with ACPI support right now is that
&gt; you don't get battery status or suspend
&gt; capability.

 Yes. It's always nice not to know how much time/battery
 is left. (Of course the notebook has a special function to
 show the percentage of battery left, but it's uncomfortable
 to activate it every 10 minutes and the turn it off again to
 have the keyboard back again.)

&gt; The former is fairly easy to do
&gt; and is coming along soon in acpid.  The later
&gt; requires signficant changes to drivers and
&gt; probably the kernel and is going to take a bit.

 I'm waiting and using APM in the meantime since there's
 no way to get them both....

You can verify that C-states work by running acpid
and looking for "ACPI Cx works" in the kernel log.
(Note, this is if your system has ACPI tables,
otherwise you need to fill in C-state latency
values for /proc/sys/acpi/p_lvlX_lat.  Sorry,
this should probably go in the documentation
somewhere)

A working S5 is verified by running acpid and
do "shutdown -h now".  Does you system power-off?
If not, S5 is not supported (check syslog) or
S5 is broken.  (This will not work at all unless
you have ACPI tables)

You can verify that ACPI events work by running
acpid and pressing the power button.  Does the
system start to shutdown?

I'll add a section to the ACPI documentation
("Do I have a working ACPI implementation?")
describing all of this.

Hi,

I'm running an Abit BP6 dual Celeron 400 (not clocked) with the latest
devel BIOS, rev QQ.  ACPI doesn't work for me, excerpt from syslog:

Apr  1 09:35:56 evansoft acpid: started

I append pmtools debugging output.

I compiled acpid with debugging enabled, I can post the output from that
as well if it helps anyone (13.5k gzipped).

If I can do anything to fix this I'd love some pointers as to which bits
of the code to concentrate on.

BTW acpid seems to work fine on my office PC (power off key turns into a
shutdown key) but I don't know if it's possible to check things like HLT
on idle.  Is there any output I can enable that shows me that acpid is
doing more than just monitoring the power button? :-)

Thanks,

Jon.

Debug stuff follows:

acpid does more than table parsing, so it cannot be easily replaced by a
"boot script". Most of its functionality (table parsing, AML code
execution) will move into the kernel later on, as future systems will
depend on that for hardware enumeration, but for now having a separate
daemon eases development.

I'm currently moving the rest of acpid's functionality, mainly system
policy decisions, into a separate daemon, which will be comparable to
apmd.

The power management policy daemons (apmd and the soon-to-come acpipold)
are not part of the kernel in my opinion, since the subsystem will work
without this daemon, so I'm against including them in the kernel.

I'm against including them in the kernel too. I'm for replacing them by
programs called from userspace like modprobe.

In order for any OS to work correctly (provide all the benefit of OSPM/ACPI
using acpi define interfaces), OSPM must be resident very early and very
late. OSPM is a term we use to describe all software that touches ACPI
define interfaces whether they be configuration or power management.

1. The AML interpreter (AMLI) is required in a number of cases. It is needed
to get interrupt routing so it must be around very early or the loader must
be able to get this info.

2. AMLI is required to parse the names space to perform motherboard device
initialization and configuration including all PCI root bridges, keyboard,
mouse, embedded controllers etc.. Some systems will need GPEs to enumerate
and so that support must be available during config time.

3. In general OSPM requires access address spaces like memory, PCI, PCI
config, the SCI interrupt, and ACPI defined "fixed" hardware.

4. To transition into the sleeping state, the system should shut down all
applications then run a control method or two and then hit the sleep type
and sleep enable registers. This can become tricky if OSPM itself is an
application. Upon wake, OSPM must perform configuration and power mgt tasks
before applications are re-enabled (awoken).

It is for these reasons and others that every OS that has implemented or is
implementing OSPM/ACPI has put the support in the OS kernel. While Linux of
course is not every OS, there is merit to the choice. 

Guy

P.S. The AMLI itself is currently around 70K code and data and has been
shrinking overtime as it has been optimized.

ditto with me with ABIT BH6,

however if I

echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/s5_[whatever]

then it turns off on shutdown. My dsdt | acpidisasm is pretty much the same,
however I will ens it if you need it Andy?

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I'm running an Abit BP6 dual Celeron 400 (not clocked) with the latest
&gt; devel BIOS, rev QQ.  ACPI doesn't work for me, excerpt from syslog:
&gt;
&gt; Apr  1 09:35:56 evansoft acpid: started

&gt; Apr  1 09:35:56 evansoft acpid: S5 not supported
&gt; Apr  1 09:35:56 evansoft acpid: no processor block
&gt;
&gt; I append pmtools debugging output.
&gt;
&gt; I compiled acpid with debugging enabled, I can post the output from that
&gt; as well if it helps anyone (13.5k gzipped).
&gt;
&gt; If I can do anything to fix this I'd love some pointers as to which bits
&gt; of the code to concentrate on.
&gt;
&gt; BTW acpid seems to work fine on my office PC (power off key turns into a
&gt; shutdown key) but I don't know if it's possible to check things like HLT
&gt; on idle.  Is there any output I can enable that shows me that acpid is
&gt; doing more than just monitoring the power button? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Jon.

OK, yes, it looks like your system does indeed
support S1, S4, and S5.  The latest acpid fails
while parsing your DSDT and that's why it
reports everything as unsupported.  This is
definitely a bug in acpid and I'm putting together
a fix.

&gt; shutdown key) but I don't know if it's possible to
&gt; check things like HLT
&gt; on idle.  Is there any output I can enable that
&gt; shows me that acpid is
&gt; doing more than just monitoring the power button?

Well, it doesn't look like your system supports
C2/C3 so there really isn't much else to see the
ACPI driver doing.  You can be sure that C1 (HLT
on idle) does happen, but there is no output
associated with it (C1 happens a lot, and it
is pretty much guaranteed to work with any x86
system)

&gt; This cannot be handled, I'm afraid. :-/ &lt;microsoft&gt;But it's not a bug,

&gt; No, seriously, if someone really wants to turn the machine off, he will

&gt; If you display a big red blinking warning message then, you will achieve
&gt; more than when you disable the power button completely.

I have to think about something like that.
May be some kind of electric shock going through the chair... :))

&gt; Parsing tables is way different from parsing AML. 
&gt; Why does there need

&gt; Andy adequate
&gt; responded to your list of drawbacks at the above
&gt; link, so I hope you
&gt; mind my request for a clarification of the issue.

And again, I'm victim to mailing list archives  :)
Actually, I've been swayed much more towards the
interpreter-in-the-kernel camp since the posting
you referenced, Jeff.

Simon is right in that control methods, including
those that return system configuration info, can
do pretty much whatever they want.  There really
is no generic way to extract config information
without running control methods at boot time.

Of course, I can think of ways around a kernel
interpreter for some specific systems.  The IA64
folks, for instance, know their interrupt routing
table is static and embedded at a specific location
in the AML so they just extract it pre-boot.  Other
systems build up a routing table dynamically with
control methods so this solution isn't going to
work across the board.

The problem gets even worse for putting devices and
the system to sleep, unless we have an interpreter
in the kernel.

	Hello !

I have an Asus K7V and the last kernel (2.3.99-pre6). When I start acpid
(the last version found on the acpi for linux web page), I experience
lockups. The debugging mode (acpid -d) doesn't work either, it hangs too
and I don't have any informations in the logs. The crash is a real good
crash because Ctrl-Altr-SysRq doesn't work.

If I can help to debug this problem, I will be glade.

There is a discrepancy between apcid and pmtools:

it seems like I am missing S4 and S5.

I know S5 works fine - 
echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ

then halt turns the computer off just fine

&gt; &gt; disabled the fpu irq by hand since SCI wanted IRQ
&gt; &gt; 13), the
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I had heard Toshiba was using int 13 for ACPI's
&gt; SCI.  That was a poor choice and is going to at
&gt; least require a patch to arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c
&gt; and possibly a kernel build configure option.

That "at least" is perhaps what's causing it all to
wedge unusably when I start "acpid", then ... got any
suggestions on what's happening there?  And how to
keep it from locking everything up?  Does any of the
recent IRQ code reworking make this better/worse?


&gt; &gt; I can keep using APM, but ACPI is supposed to work
&gt; &gt; too;
&gt; 
&gt; OK, remember, ACPI support on Linux is not complete.
&gt; Only power off, power button, and processor power
&gt; states (save power while system is idle) are
&gt; currently working fully.  I would not expect
&gt; suspend to work yet.

Of course, the problems started right before I had
to enter "press all buttons until something happens"
debugging mode!!

Yes, I know it's not "complete" yet.  But -- what
should I do to help figure out the first problem?
(Namely, why starting "acpid" wedged the machine.)

Hi all,

this patch (against 2.3.99-pre6) provides PCI quirk for VIA ACPI
device (same as for Intel and ALI).
Possible conflict between resource[4] and resource[7] had beed fixed.

By assuming that the code was intended to do

was, trying to find out what about the code I
didn't understand...

So, for the next person new to acpidisasm who
tries to work with it, I've included the patch

On Tue, 9 May 2000, Michael K. Johnson wrote:

&gt; My suggested architecture is that acpictl be the audited,
&gt; secure middleman between users and acpid.

Actually I thought of using a separate daemon for this, acpipold. Users
that don't want to use complex policy management (such as on embedded
systems can use a separate (or cut down) daemon. Also, when acpid's
funktionality gets merged into the kernel, the only thing that would have
to be changed is the communications method to the kernel.

&gt; acpictl can be setuid or perhaps (on systems such as Red Hat Linux
&gt; that support it) managed via consolehelper.

I'm using AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM sockets with SO_PASSCRED (Linux) or
SO_CREDENTIALS (NetBSD). This allows authentication without suid.

&gt; In any case, it can have a configuration file that defines
&gt; what normal users are allowed to do: for example, are they allowed
&gt; to set policy or only to query values?

Configuration is my greatest problem at this point. Having never used
bison before and not really having a clue how to write the rules in a
reasonable form. Some time ago, I hacked up a few rules, however they're
in broken English language rather than C. See also

http://phobos.fs.tum.de/pipermail/acpi/1999-July/000073.html

&gt; I imagine that some people
&gt; will want to set policies as normal users, and other people will
&gt; want just as strongly for normal users not to be allowed to set
&gt; policies.  Depends on the context.

Yes, and people will want to set policies from their GNOME panels and MPEG
players ("While a MPEG is playing, don't blank the screen." You can't
imagine how many people have asked for this...)

&gt; I'm going to start working on this now, but if anyone has
&gt; any better ideas or improvements to this one, feel free to
&gt; propose them.

Yes, it's been in CVS for a long time, however non-functional because I
can't think of a proper config format. The code is in CVS, in the
repository at /work/cvs/acpi, module acpipolicy (as announced on
development.html).

Of course, it immediately occurred to me that I should just look at
the kernel and acpid to see how they calculate checksums, after a
quick look in the standard showed nothing related to checksums in
the index or the table of contents.

Well, I thought that was a good idea until I tried.  I don't see
any checksum calculation in acpi.c and the checksum is ignored for
resource descriptors, at least, in acpid -- that is, I don't see
any checksum calculation tied to the End Tag in rscalcb.c.  I'll
be glad to be proved wrong.

Or are ASL compiler writers so horrible that none of the checksums
will work out anyway and so we just have to lump it?

Right, the ACPI driver is not doing checksums
because I was seeing otherwise valid tables with
the checksum done completely wrong.  The driver
could at least generate a warning message on
bad checksum I suppose.

The checksum should just be an 8-bit sum.
Nothing magical.  Not exactly a good checksum
algorithm either.  I guess they thought nobody'd
get that wrong  :)

I find myself often questioning the quality of

there want to write or provide an open-source
compiler?  It probably wouldn't be too much work
and I know many people (hardware vendors,
ACPI4Linux, etc.) that would love to use it.

I'm afraid that it would print out so many errors
that people would start to look at us as incorrigible
pedants.  I've seen this with other code -- warnings
that show up on essentially every platform talking
about how non-standard it is, and everyone else just
rolls their eyes and makes deprecating comments
about the myopic developers who can't see past their
standards...

I suppose that a single error message printed when
the first bad checksum showed up wouldn't be that
bad, as long as it only is printed once per boot.

Now, in a disassembler or debugger it would make sense
to warn about bad checksums even if they occur often;
there it might make a difference, in part because more
and more hardware manufacturers are working directly
with Linux.

I'll at least tell Dell that their checksums appear
to be wrong.  However, since they appear to be using
the ASL template macros, I would expect the bug is
in the ASL template macros.

I have included a small patch to be applied after the
patch I just sent; it re-enables checksum computation
and prints warnings when checksums do not match, and
has a comment explaining why.

&gt;The checksum should just be an 8-bit sum.
&gt;Nothing magical.  Not exactly a good checksum
&gt;algorithm either.  I guess they thought nobody'd
&gt;get that wrong  :)

OK, I was doing the right checksum algorithm, at
least.  Now I feel better.  (Well, kind of; it is
not comfortable to know that we have to deal with
output from a compiler that can't even get checksums
correct...)

&gt;I find myself often questioning the quality of
&gt;currently available ASL compilers.  Anyone out
&gt;there want to write or provide an open-source
&gt;compiler?  It probably wouldn't be too much work
&gt;and I know many people (hardware vendors,
&gt;ACPI4Linux, etc.) that would love to use it.

In particular, I suppose a compiler would help us
make ACPI work on hardware with broken or missing
ACPI implementations, and thus would kind of fit
within my overall mission of making ACPI a sufficient
replacement for APM ASAP.  Would we really be able
to make that kind of use of it?  What other use
would it be to us?

Don't let me get in anyone else's way if anyone
else is interested, though, and I'm not committing
to it.  I think that there is enough other work for
me to do now that is more directly applicable to my
main goal at the moment.  :-)

Hi,

I've been using my Portege happily with Linux 2.2 and 2.3
for the year since I got it.  It was a bit of work to get
APM/APMD to behave, and more to get USB to work even after
laptop suspend, but it all works with pre6 (though a new USB
suspend patch is desirable).

BUT:  ACPI isn't behaving at all.  After I got a pre6
kernel to boot (pci=biosirq needed to let SCI work, and
disabled the fpu irq by hand since SCI wanted IRQ 13), the
whole machine wedged when I started acpid (0425, current).

Couldn't type at the keyboard any more.  The power button
was ignored.  (Regardless of whether or not I enable the
'experimental' S1 support.)

All I could do was shut the laptop and wait about 15
seconds (MUCH more than APM needs), and then the machine
seemed to get clued in that it should try tp suspend.
Disk spin, mode LED flashes (faster than usual, I think).

Open laptop.  NOP.  Wait some more, just in case. NOP.

Will it listen to the power button now?  Yes.  Fat lot
of good though -- disk whir, LED flash off.  Keyboard
still dead.  Screen briefly shows a single underscore
cursor before going dark.  It appears that it chose to
interpret the power button as a powerdown request (fine),
but only after that strange suspend was done (not fine).

During that experiment, I'd saved 'acpid -d' output:

	acpid: started
	acpid: FACP loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/
	acpid: DSDT loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/
	acpid: S0 SLP_TYP (0x0000)
	acpid: S1 SLP_TYP (0x0100)
	acpid: S2 not supported
	acpid: S3 SLP_TYP (0x0300)
	acpid: S4 SLP_TYP (0x0500)
	acpid: S5 SLP_TYP (0x0500)
	acpid: P_BLK 1 @ 0x18b0:6
	acpid: power button pressed

And /var/log/messages reported various ACPI data:

	kernel: e820: 00010000 @ 04010000 (ACPI data)
	kernel: e820: 00000200 @ ffee6e00 (ACPI NVS)
	...
	ACPI: "TOSHIB" found at 0x000fa30
	...	
	kernel: ACPI C2 works
	kernel: ACPI C3 works
	...

The former agrees with what "acpidmp DST | acpianalyse"
says, except it also lists a processor and battery.
(In some run I was actually able to run 'acpictl' and
it didn't report a battery though.)

"pmtest" reports only PCMCIA (D0) and keyboard (D0).
That's pretty much all the info I seem able to turn up.


Suggestions on what's going on here?  Fixes?  This is unusable.

I can keep using APM, but ACPI is supposed to work too;
and it seems to behave in Win98. (Though one can rarely
tell what causes that to suicide!  :-)

p.s. I notice the Portege 3015 has a partial bios entry
	on the project page ... the 3020 should be the
	same hardware with a faster CPU and perhaps other
	minor system updates.  So far as I can tell, the
	entry there matches what 'acpidmp FACP | acpitbl'
	says ... but the field labels don't match (and
	are in hex vs decimal) so it's	hard to be sure.

Yes, I had heard Toshiba was using int 13 for ACPI's
SCI.  That was a poor choice and is going to at
least require a patch to arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c
and possibly a kernel build configure option.

&gt; I can keep using APM, but ACPI is supposed to work
&gt; too;

OK, remember, ACPI support on Linux is not complete.
Only power off, power button, and processor power
states (save power while system is idle) are
currently working fully.  I would not expect
suspend to work yet.

Yes, the only way you would hit that code is if
you called acpi_sprint_op directly with a NULL
acpi_op.  Right, acpi_show is not going to hit
it.

I doesn't really matter to me either way.  You

OK, that makes sense.  It just makes my job a little harder.  I'll
have to think about the cleanest way to handle those other cases.

&gt;&gt;I notice that plenty of the EISA IDs are ???d041 on this machine.

Aha, PNPfoo.

&gt;&gt;I also notice some HIDs with non-ascii characters; particularly
&gt;&gt;nulls, which show up as @'s when decoded:

I guess so.  I interpreted the number as I understood the spec to
have it done, but I guess I misunderstood.  That will be trivial
to fix.

Thanks!

Now it's quite clear that it *is* important to print out these PnP
IDs when we can; it's quite easy to screw up, as I have demonstrated.

Andy, I'll fix this and send out a new patch that supercedes the

We need a good way for programs to be able to query acpid for
information and to set policies.  I've been thinking about one
way to do it that will be reasonably possible to secure.

acpid basically has to run as root, and we want most of this
functionality to be available to users (for example, querying
battery life).  This means that we need to sanitize the requests
to avoid acpid being a security hole.

My suggested architecture is that acpictl be the audited,
secure middleman between users and acpid.  acpictl can be setuid
or perhaps (on systems such as Red Hat Linux that support it)
managed via consolehelper.  It could also use PAM directly to
authenticate on systems that support it.  There are many options
here...  In any case, it can have a configuration file that defines
what normal users are allowed to do: for example, are they allowed
to set policy or only to query values?  I imagine that some people
will want to set policies as normal users, and other people will
want just as strongly for normal users not to be allowed to set
policies.  Depends on the context.

acpictl would have two modes of operation.  One would be a
fairly normal mode where it takes some command-line arguments,
does something about them, and exits.  In the other mode,
chosen by some command-line argument or by argv[0] or both,
it would open a pipe to apcid and then drop extra privileges.
It would then read textual commands from stdin, sanitize the
requests according to site policy, pass the sanitized
requests along to acpid, read results, and pass them back
in textual form on stdout.  This would be all be done
asynchronously, I expect, unless that will put too great
a burden on acpid.

I'm going to start working on this now, but if anyone has
any better ideas or improvements to this one, feel free to
propose them.

OK, but there is no possibility of any PnP ID being compiled into a BYTE,
because at least two bytes will be taken up with three non-null characters,
correct?

&gt;Also, recently sometime PnP ID is expressed as string. like "ACPI0003" or "*PNP0700".
&gt;So, your condition blanch for _HID/_CID should treat DWORD, WORD, and StringPrefix.

There's no need to handle strings explicitly -- they are already in string
form and do not need to be decoded.  I'm just working on the disassembler,
not the interpreter.

However, I was ignoring _CID objects before, I'll add them.

&gt;Following code fragment may converts a Packed ID in a byte stream to PnPID.

Well, the convert_endian function that you don't include is the only
thing that really differs in anything but style from the code I already
wrote.  :-)

I think the best you can do is look for a named
object called _HID or _CID and then, if the
value is an integer, try the conversion to a
PNP string.  I don't think any lower level
work is going to help.  There is no additional
information we would have at parse time.

Do you know about patch's "-l" option?  It will

Regarding writing a compiler, one of the important things that is
missing from the ACPI specification is the encoding of an EISAID.
They expected everyone who read the standard to know that as a
matter of course.  :-)

Here's an excerpt from the PnP BIOS specification, converted into
ASCII format, that describes how to construct an EISAID from an
EISAIDString.

[begin excerpt]
Device product identifier:

This field is an EISA ID, which is a seven character ASCII representation
of the product identifier compressed into a 32-bit identifier. The
seven character ID consists of a three character manufacturer code,
a three character hexadecimal product identifier, and a one character
hexadecimal revision number. For example, the third revision of the ABC
device might have an uncompressed ID such as ABC1003.

The manufacturer code is a 3 uppercase character code that is compressed
into 3 5-bit values as follows:
 1. Find hex ASCII value for each letter
 2. Subtract 40h from each ASCII value
 3. Retain 5 least-significant bits for each letter by discarding upper
    3-bits because they are always 0.
 4. Compressed code = Concatenate 0 and the 3 5-bit values for the character.

The format of the compressed product identifier is as follows:
Byte	Bits		Description
0	Bit 7:		Reserved (0)
	Bits 6-2:	1st character of the compressed manufacturer code
	Bits 1-0:	Upper 2 bits of the 2nd character of the compressed
			manufacturer code
1	Bits 7-5:	Lower 3 bits of the 2nd character of the compressed
			manufacturer code. 
	Bits 4-0:	3rd character of the compressed manufacturer code.
			(bit 4 is most significant)
2	Bits 7-4:	1st hexadecimal digit of the product number.
			(bit 7 is most significant)
	Bits 3-0:	2nd hexadecimal digit of the product number.
			(bit 3 is most significant)
3	Bits 7-4:	3rd hexadecimal digit of the product number
			(bit 7 is most significant)
	Bits 3-0:	Hexadecimal digit for the revision number.
			(bit 3 is most significant)
[end excerpt]

So ABC1003 would be encoded as 0x04431003, if I used bc correctly...

&gt; In particular, I suppose a compiler would help us

&gt; really be able
&gt; to make that kind of use of it?  What other use
&gt; would it be to us?

No, I think using the compiler to fix broken or
missing ACPI implementations is entirely the wrong
idea.  We should push hardware/BIOS vendors to
ensure that their tables are correct.  With growing
Linux momentum, I believe it should be quite
possible for us to say "Hey, your ACPI is broken
and will not work with Linux" and actually see a
timely response.  For example, see AMI...

The value in an open-source compiler would be to
get vendors to generate the correct AML in the
first place.  Add plenty of warnings, don't let
them get away with all of the wrong code that
the MS compiler passes right through.  Also, an
open source compiler would allow people working
on the interpreter and OS side to understand
exactly what AML is going to be generated from
said ASL.

An open-source compiler could very well become
a good reference compiler from which we could
generate feedback for those working on the ACPI
spec.  All of this closed spec work is definitely
in need of something along the lines of the
IETF, sample implementation before spec completion.

&gt; Don't let me get in anyone else's way if anyone
&gt; else is interested, though, and I'm not committing
&gt; to it.  I think that there is enough other work for
&gt; me to do now that is more directly applicable to my
&gt; main goal at the moment.  :-)

Yes, getting the ACPI implementation up to the level
of APM should really be the highest priority.  I
just mentioned the compiler idea if anyone out there
has some spare cycles and would like to see the
product of their labor in wide use across the
computer industry.

&gt; There are much, much more serious problems

&gt; are wonderful people like Andy at all three
&gt; companies who really understand this, but
&gt; they are clearly not high enough up the
&gt; corporate ladder to set policy for the ACPI
&gt; standard.

Hey, I agree.  Closed spec work is inherently
troubling.  And for PC technologies like ACPI that
will affect so many Linux users, it is unfortunate
that Linux developers have very little opportunity
to participate in shaping the spec.  As always,
Linux development is relegated to "here is the
hardware, here is the interface, work with it."

I do understand the other side of the argument
though.  Spec work by a closed consortium of
companies allows specs to be completed and
product released fast.  And, right or wrong,
closed spec work allows companies to feel like
they are protecting hardware interfaces and
other things they consider to be intellectual
property.

So, yes, that's the way things are and it's
going to be hard to reshape that environment
to allow participation of the Linux community.
But I do think companies are starting to realize
that there is a growing and vigilant Linux
community out there and they are beginning to
take heed of feedback.  After all, with so
much attention currently focussing on Linux,
who is willing to have their hardware designed
out?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I see at least two bugs that are mine but I don't
&gt; &gt; think that they explain the majority of your
&gt; &gt; problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; #1  The ACPI driver loads, finds your RSDT in
&gt; &gt;     unreserved RAM (bad, BIOS E820 or the E820
&gt; &gt;     handling code isn't doing the right thing),
&gt; &gt;     fails, and probably falls back to a chipset
&gt; &gt;     specific driver.  This is bad and the ACPI
&gt; &gt;     driver should just quit if any of you ACPI
&gt; &gt;     tables are messed up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; #2  I see you are building in APM support.  APM
&gt; &gt;     checks for ACPI before loading but ACPI doesn't
&gt; &gt;     check for APM when it is loaded as a module.
&gt; &gt;     As a result, both are up and running at the
&gt; &gt;     same time.  This is bad and I should prevent it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't not know where the crash on insmod of
&gt; &gt; acpi.o is coming from.  From the lsmod, the ACPI
&gt; &gt; driver must have crashed on init starting the
&gt; &gt; chipset-specific driver.  For the moment, you
&gt; &gt; might want to add "acpi=tables" to your kernel
&gt; &gt; command line and see if that stops the crash.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I send out fixes for #1 and #2 shortly.  I'm
&gt; &gt; afraid neither of these are the root cause of
&gt; &gt; your problems though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the thorough bug report.

No problem!

Now here are my latest results.

2.3.99-pre4-3 together with acpi_patch-2.3.99-3 (Yep, has some shm bugs
(X)...:-)

I think it has something to-do with the memory detection routine (the "new"
E820 stuff?).
After I figured out that I should try booting without the "append =
"mem=256M"" line in lilo.conf I didn't get anymore hangs with eepro100 and
ACPI !!!
But most tools show "only" 255MB RAM?

Yes, while acpid is broken, you can fill in the
/proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ value by hand to get
S5 working if (if your system supports S5 and S5
actually works)

Look in the output of "acpidmp DSDT | acpidisasm"
for a _S5_ entry

  Name _S5_
   Package
     0x04
     0x01
     0x02
     0x00
     0x00

For the above _S5_ entry, you would then do

  echo 0x12 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ
         ^^
         |+- from 3rd byte of S5 package (SLP_TYP_B)
         +- from 2nd byte of S5 package (SLP_TYP_A)

Messy but acpid usually takes care of this for you.

&gt; The kernel reports a VIAVP4 bios.

This is probably due to the acpid parsing bug.
A fix is in progress.

Remember, though, that just because your system
supports ACPI doesn't mean it necessarily supports
*all* ACPI features (eg. C2, C3, S1, S5, etc.)
The only way to know for sure is to check out
the contents of your ACPI tables.

&gt; Also, why does ACPI break the apm power off?

To have APM power off on most systems, you need
to engage the APM BIOS.  This is not possible
when ACPI is enabled.  Like I've been saying,
ACPI and APM, you only get one or the other.

Right, the ACPI driver in the kernel generates
the /proc/sys/acpi entry.

Hmm..  I don't know if the VAIO does fully support
ACPI or not.  I know older models don't have ACPI

so you should at least get some ACPI support.

Take a look at the kernel log (dmesg) and see if
you get any output from the ACPI driver.  Something
like

  ACPI: found PIIX4 at 0xXXXX

If your system doesn't have ACPI tables (sounds
like it doesn't) and isn't PIIX4 or VIA, then
you might not be supported.

Hi,

Do you know what this means?

Well, it means you have a PIIX4 chipset which is
good.  At least you should have chipset support
for ACPI (gives you processor power states (C-states)
and ACPI events)

If you are building in ACPI support, the ACPI driver
will at least see you have PIIX4 and try to use that.

&gt; Before I bought this notebook computer, I asked Sony
&gt; tech support and they 
&gt; told me it supports ACPI.  :-(  Do you know any

Your notebook could very well be ACPI compliant
but probably isn't if it is not detected by the
ACPI driver (ie. missing ACPI tables) "Supports
ACPI", might be used somewhat ambiguously here.
Your chipset definitely supports some ACPI features
by virtue of it being PIIX4 but you also need
additional platform support to get higher ACPI
functionality (power off, suspend, battery support,
etc.)

&gt; notebook computer that 
&gt; supports ACPI for sure?

Sure, most notebooks now have ACPI support. Look
for something like "ACPI 1.0 compliant" in the
system description.

When I run acpid -d I get:

Why are they not supported?
The kernel reports a VIAVP4 bios.

Also, why does ACPI break the apm power off?

Hi,

Sorry for the wide distribution.  Is there a newsgroup to post questions 
for this project, instead of a mailing list?

I ftp acpid and pmtools from the web site.  I checked the mail archive but 
did not find enough information to get started.  I guess the first thing to 
do is to start acpi daemon by running

acpid/acpid

Is this correct?  It seems that something else needs to be done first.  I 
got this message:

acpid: ACPI is not present

It is probably generated while checking ACPI_PROC (#define 
"/proc/sys/acpi").  Who should create it?

Thanks for your help.

Hi all,

Do you have a plan to change \_OS_ object defined by AML interpreter?

Currently, acpid has "Linux AML interpreter"(older one was just "AML interpreter")
as _OS which is very generic definition and will be used forever.
_REV is 2 which is likely to change.

Is this correct?

Hello,

I ftp and installed the latest linux kernel (2.3.99-pre5, released this 
Tuesday).  The machine is Sony VAIO F-450 notebook computer.  This is a 
very new machine (released this year) and I believe it supports ACPI. I

still got

The docs say the 82443MX combines the South bridge (PIIX4E) and North Bridge
(440BX) in one chip.  As the south bridge is responsible for most power
management functionality (and I can't find anything substantive in the
PDF specs for the 440MX), I'd have to rely on the PIIX4E documentation for
power management functionality... should be fairly
identical: http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/290562.htm

Ok, so maybe I have some modification to do somewhere in the kernel to
explain that the chipset
is really a PIIX4E and that all power managment functions have to be used
accordingly.
How is the selection of the Power Management Registers done in the kernel
??? (APM or ACPI)
Could it be that all behaviours problems could come from the non detection
of the chipset as it
should be - i.e. a PIIX4E instead of an unknown chipset ?
What do you think ?

No idea on that one (yet).  I'm involved in the BIOS side of ACPI :-).

Someone else might be able to answer that....as far as I can tell, it should
still see the PIIX4 power management PCI device function correctly if the code
looks for its PCI vendor/device ID (0x8086 / 0x7113).  Should be a simple
matter to search for the 0x8086 / 0x7113 values in the source code that define
the Power Management PCI function in the PIIX4 I suppose....

&gt; What do you think ?

Maybe My little message was a bit suprising isn't it ?

Sorrry about that. My exchange client just crash when sending this.
So let's do it again.
The hang in my laptop is caused by the acpi_irq which get called over
and over without reason.
I traced the values from the call :
pm1_status 0x00000100 pm1_enable 0x00000001
gpe_status0x07000000 gpe_enable 0x0000000
I used %08x for printing those values.


Can someone lend me a hand to interpret these results ?

My small requests are 

- _OS contains string "Linux" at the top as in current design.
    And should not change.  Then BIOS can clearly and easily identiy Linux.  
    If you make variations like "Linux", "LINUX OS", "RedHat LINUX", and so on...,
    String compare in ASL will be quite complex and costs a lot of time.

- _REV will be changed by update if acpid or kernel contain big changes.
    If you need BIOS to know or take care of design change, _REV should be changed.
    Then BIOS can identify the version of Linux.

- Please don't change these strategy.
    If you change both _OS and _REV frequently, ASL conditions will be quite complex.
    BIOS developpers need extra works and No benefits for all end users.



FYI.  Microsoft has different strategy.
- _OS will be changed by new OS.
- _REV is a version number of ACPI spec that is supported by the AML interpreter.



Thanks

Hi, Andy,

I guess you wrote this file (arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c) for Linux 
2.3.99-pre5.  I did some tracing and found the following.

in acpi_find_tables, rsdt_entry_count is 2 before entering while

In the first iteration, !acpi_init_table(&amp;acpi_facp...) is 
true.  acpi_facp.table is assigned to an non-NULL value (0xc8802b65).  Also 
acpi_init_table(&amp;acpi_dsdt, dt...) also succeeds.

In the second iteration, !acpi_init_table(&amp;acpi_facp...) is 
false.  acpi_facp.table is assigned to NULL.

As a result, it concludes that "missing FACP"

How many tables should the system have?

Thanks!
Have a nice weekend.

Subject: ACPI bug

Hi,
I think I've found a bug in the pre4 patch and pre5.
The acpi FACP table is detected only is the FACP table is the last table of
the RSDT.
If the table is in first position the acpi_facp is initialized correctly but
at the second occurence of the loop,
it is cleared by the acpi_init_table.
This functions checks that the signature matches the expected one but if not
the case, the table is cleared.
This leads to no FACP table found error despite the face it is OK.
I checked the fix on a laptop and a desktop (ASUS P5B) and it's ok.

acpi.c :
-----------------------
	while (rsdt_entry_count) {
		struct acpi_table *dt = acpi_map_table(*rsdt_entry);
		if (!acpi_init_table(&amp;acpi_facp, dt, 1)) {
			struct acpi_facp *facp
				= (struct acpi_facp*) acpi_facp.table;

			// map DSDT if it exists
			dt = acpi_map_table(facp-&gt;dsdt);
			if (acpi_init_table(&amp;acpi_dsdt, dt, 1))
				acpi_unmap_table(dt);
			else
+  				break;
		}
		else {
			acpi_unmap_table(dt);
		}

Subject: 440MX getting closer

Maybe I'm not talking to the right place for those kind of informations. If
not, could you tell me where should I head to ?

I'm still trying to use the 440MX on a NEC versa note 2000.
I've been able to check the ACPI tables. They are OK - acpidmp gives me the
correct answers-.
Now I've narrowed the problem to enabling ACPI irq.
All ACPI tables are found. The kernel freeze somewhere in the irq_enable
function.
It tries to enable the irq 9 which looks suspicious to me, but after
checking my ASUS board, I think it's OK (same IRQ too).
Now, could someone explain me how could the irq_enable "hang" the machine
like that ?

I think it's APM related, whenever the kernel tried to do something related
to "power saving" the machine locks.


Is there any magic to do with that chipset ?
The datasheet says that 440MX is a fusion between north bridge and south
bridge and that it is basicaly a PIIX.
Maybe there is some work to do about PIIX (which is recognized by IRQ router
but not by the other checks).

	Hi all !

I'm the owner of a K7V motherboard and I have some troubles with ACPI. I
have tried any kernels (the last 2.3.99-pre5 or pre6-3) and ACPI is not
working with my motherboard.

I got these messages during the boot:
TCP: Hash tables configured (established 16384 bind 16384)
Initializing RT netlink socket
ACPI: "ASUS" found at 0x000f5cc0
ACPI: missing FACP
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.13)

I have read the code (arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c) and I have put some printk
to see where it was failing (in acpi_find_tables and acpi_init_table). For
what I have seen, the driver finds the ACPI pages in memory, try to find
(in order) FACP, DSDT, BOOT (during the loop while (rsdt_entry_count)).
BOOT is the problem because when trying to find BOOT the driver find
FACP. Is this behaviour correct ? 

If I insert a break after the if (// map FACS if it exists), it works. I
think it is not the good fix but it works (I have at least /proc/sys/acpi).
But after that, ACPI is not working. I have launched acpid and nothing
works ! When the computer must power off, the only thing to be powered off
is the screen ! Neither power or sleep buttons work.

I have attached a dump of acpidmp with this mail.

Thank you for your support !

Everything is ok but I can't wake the system with wake-on-lan.

When I use 2.2.14 kernel, I have no problem to wake up the system with wake-on-lan.

How can I catch two rabbits?

Yes, acpi (or "acpictl" as it will be called soon)
is just a toy for now to show how user applications
would connect to acpid.  The "Not implemented"
message refers to the command acpi sends to acpid
and not to ACPI itself.

Does your message mean that I couldn't wake up the system with WOL in =
the current ACPI4Linux?

Without ACPI (kernel 2.2.14) , I can wake up the system!

Can I change the same system status with kernel 2.2.14 (no ACPI) when I =
shutdown with ACPI?

Hi, Everyone,

You probably find out that I am learning this project. :-)  I hope to 
contribute something once I understand things better.  Thanks!

1. It seems that pmtest will keep a device in the designated state 
regardless of coming requests.  For example, I can put my PCMCIA network 
card into D3.  However, when I ping another machine, it does not wake up 
automatically.  Is this an intended feature, or I did something wrong?

2. This may be related to the first question.  Can we put a hard disk drive 
into a sleeping state?  If a device cannot wake up automatically, we will 
not be able to wake up HDD since HDD is needed to execute pmtest.  Is this 
right?

3. According to Intel's Mobile Power Guide 
(http://developer.intel.com/design/mobile/intelpower/int_mpg.htm#download). 
CPU (9.5W) is the biggest power sink.  Is there any plan in this project to 
address this issue?  FYI: LCD 4.3W, Power Supply 2.6W, Graphics 2.4W.

4. When I change the power state of VGA, my LCD display (on a notebook 
computer) did not change.  I guess VGA and LCD have different ID's.

Where can I find a complete table for device ID (shown in pmtest)?

0x41d00303	"keyboard"
0x41d00510     "IRDA"
0x41d00e00     "PCMCIA"

Can I just add new entries, say LCD, for other devices and change their 
power states?

5. Is anybody writing a program that tells a user how much battery capacity 
is left and how fast the system is draining the battery?  This will be very 
useful for us to quantify the success of the project.

I'm still looking forward why this chipset isn't working correctly.

All I know for now is that :
1) the acpi tables are correctly found
2) the acpi sci_enable does not work. It freezes completely the machine and
I don't know why.

Could someone help me about this  ?? Please!!

I did it. Nothing changes.
After some research (translate some printk :)), I can tell you that the
acpi_irq is looping foreever
(or I'd rather says that it is called all the time - I have a lot of message
in out in out in out in out on the screen
after placing some printk inside the interrupt handler).

Why ? I'll find tonight or tomorrow (it 21:02 CEST now and i'm at work).

&gt; &gt; Ok, so maybe I have some modification to do somewhere in the kernel to

&gt; used
&gt; &gt; accordingly.
&gt; &gt; How is the selection of the Power Management Registers done in the
&gt; kernel
&gt; &gt; ??? (APM or ACPI)
&gt; 
&gt; No idea on that one (yet).  I'm involved in the BIOS side of ACPI :-).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Could it be that all behaviours problems could come from the non
&gt; detection
&gt; &gt; of the chipset as it
&gt; &gt; should be - i.e. a PIIX4E instead of an unknown chipset ?
&gt; 
&gt; Someone else might be able to answer that....as far as I can tell, it
&gt; should
&gt; still see the PIIX4 power management PCI device function correctly if the
&gt; code
&gt; looks for its PCI vendor/device ID (0x8086 / 0x7113).  Should be a simple
&gt; matter to search for the 0x8086 / 0x7113 values in the source code that
&gt; define
&gt; the Power Management PCI function in the PIIX4 I suppose....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What do you think ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The docs say the 82443MX combines the South bridge (PIIX4E) and North
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bridge
&gt; &gt; &gt; (440BX) in one chip.  As the south bridge is responsible for most
&gt; power
&gt; 
&gt; Woops.. make that (440GX)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; management functionality (and I can't find anything substantive in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; PDF specs for the 440MX), I'd have to rely on the PIIX4E documentation
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; power management functionality... should be fairly
&gt; &gt; &gt; identical:

&gt;From above, it doesn't look like an ACPI event is

I have a P3B-F M/B made from ASUS.
I have installed Redhat 6.2 and there is no problem to power off when I
shut down my linux box.

Today, I upgraded kernel to 2.4.0-test5 and enabled the experimental ACPI
interpreter option.
I tried to press power switch to shutdown my linux box and I could see 
the normal shutdown procedure (just like unmounting file system and etc.)
But it doesn't power off. It gave me below message.

--------------------------------------
...
The system is halted
Power down.
ACPI: S5 failed
---------------------------------------

What's the problem?
I got the messages in boot sequence.

----------------------------------------------
...

ACPI:7 throttling states

Eeeeek!  Try sending your email as ASCII, please!

As long as they don't hold down the power switch for 4 seconds (that
causes an immediate poweroff that cannot be avoided in software), it
is technologically feasible to run shutdown when the power switch is
depressed.

The ACPI implementation is immature and in flux, but that is the
expected default behavior of the power button when ACPI is running.

[Attachment #2 (text/plain)]

Hi. 
 
I have installed Red hat 6.2.
And I upgraded my linux kernel to 2.4.0-test5.
Of course, I check ACPI menu like following.
 
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_S1_SLEEP=y
 
I succedded kernel upgrade. After I reboot my linux box,
upgraded kernel is working well.
But, my linux box do not have /proc/sys/acpi directory.
In Howto, /proc/sys/acpi directory does not exist, 
odds are you didn't configure the kernel correctly.
What can i do for correctly kernel upgrade??

Our Apache does content negotiation, i.e. it gives you the document in
your preferred language, however this requires that you have set this up
in your browser. There are quite a lot of people who read the German
pages, so I'm not too keen on dropping them. I'll see whether I can hack
something up. :-)

Hello there,

I am having problems shutting down on my computer. When I do a poweroff, the last \
                message that I have on my screen is:
ACPI: S5 Failed.

However, my dmesg says :  
ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0xe410:6
ACPI: C2 supported
ACPI: 7 throttling states
ACPI: S1 supported
ACPI: S5 supported
ACPI C2 works

I am using linux kernel 2.4.0-test5 with acpi compiled in. Also, I am using acpid \
version 071100. The mobo I am using is an ASUS CUBX, no upgrades made to the BIOS.    \


Can any1 help me? Thanks in advance..if You need more information..I'll look it up :)

Greetz,

FreudO

&gt; From: Garst R. Reese [mailto:reese@isn.net]
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. What does DSDT stand for?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Differentiated System Description Table. This is where the 
&gt; motherboard's
&gt; &gt; resources are described, in Acpi Machine Language (AML).
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way to build a correct substitute? The motherboard's
&gt; resources are
&gt; known.
&gt; If not, then I think it is a bug to treat acpi as working on this
&gt; machine, and it should have reverted to apm.

Microsoft basically does this when installing the OS:

if (on good bios list)
	install in ACPI mode
else if (bios date after x)
	install in ACPI mode
else
	install in APM/legacy mode

Note that they do this at system install time, so if you install in APM,
upgrade bios, you're still in APM mode.

I think the same thing is appropriate for us, but system boot may be a
better time to make the choice.

apm -s works on 2.2.13, 2.3.51, but not 2.4.0testx after acpi stuff went
in.
acpi is off
CONFIG_PM=y
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_APM=m
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y

I think the acpi changes screwed up CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS=y

Well, it would be cool to have a good BIOS/bad BIOS list. Max started this
some time ago, but the data is getting out of date, so we'd need an easy
way for users to submit new data and to check whether their BIOS is good.

Max/others, any ideas?

Is there a way to configure the acpid? Something like a acpid.conf? I don't

that for some reason, activity in X is registering with acpid.

&gt; Yes, I am running ACPI, and nothing else. I didn't compile APM support into the

&gt;  &gt; &gt; Yes, sorry. It suspends the display while I am using it X, which

&gt; &gt; Are you sure you are using ACPI? I've seen things like this occur with
&gt; &gt; APM, and since AFAIK the keyboard handling code in X11 changed before 4.0,
&gt; &gt; it may very well be possible that the keycodes are intercepted before APM

I got pretty much the same result with the old ACPI modules as

But I found the problem, and it was only coincidental that acpi happend
at the same time. Andy Hendroid disabled interrupts on suspend with a
cli.
This screwed my Thinkpad.
Apologies to ACPI4Linux, but they should also check if DSDT works before

&gt; &gt; Are you sure you are using ACPI? I've seen things like this occur with

Hi Sasa,

Basically, it looks like it's trying to find out which sleep states your pc
supports, but the data being returned is not in the format expected (the
code is at linux/drivers/acpi/hardware/hwregs.c line 176 if you're
interested).

It *should* be fixed, but I don't think it will hurt anything for it to be
temporarily broken...

Hmm.  I doubt it is fixed.  Of the dozens of different machines I have, I have
yet to find one that doesn't blabber errors or warnings on boot about ACPI.

Do you mean suspending the computer or the display? Your description
sounds like the latter, and my first suspicion would be that the display
isn't put into suspend mode by X but by the OS. X thus thinks it doesn't
need to reinitialize the graphics board. But that's only a rough guess,
based on what's usually the cause :-) ...

To the list: I haven't been following the development lately, is there an
explanation why the kernel would suspend the display with ACPI (I know APM
does this)?

Are you sure you are using ACPI? I've seen things like this occur with
APM, and since AFAIK the keyboard handling code in X11 changed before 4.0,
it may very well be possible that the keycodes are intercepted before APM
sees them.

After several hours of tinkering, I have concluded that at least on this system
the best way to break an suspension in X is to Cntrl-Alt-F7. For some reason,
Cntrl-Alt-function key seems to recognized and breaks the suspension regardless
of whether or not the system is in a X session or console. No big deal I guess,
other than it suspending while I am using X. I'll just have to remember to hit
those keys rather than bumping the mouse. I don't suppose anyone knows how to
edit the keys that are suppose to break the suspension? 

Casey

It isn't possible at all because of the way this works. Ctrl-Alt-Fx
changes console in X, changing console means X setting up the graphics
board. That's why it works. :-)

If I could understand about the nature of the problem, I would probably
submit a patch to either Andy or XFree86. So far, I only have the
suspicion that ACPI blanks the console without X knowing. I would
appreciate if someone who is more into the code and has more time on
his/her hands would take a look at it.

Hi guys,

I enabled ACPI support and get "ACPI: support found" on boot followed by
"ACPI: namespace load failed". I don't know ACPI spec. I enabled ACPI in
the BIOS and the motherboard manual (GA 6BXD) says it does support ACPI.

Any ideas?

(this is not critical for me as I utterly don't care about any PM - I was
just going through various bits to see if they are working or not and am
willing to help debugging what is broken)

&gt; From: Garst R. Reese &lt;reese@isn.net&gt;
&gt; 1. What do these error messages mean?
&gt;  in /var/adm/debug
&gt; This is on an IBM Thinkpad 380D
&gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: ACPI Subsystem version [Jun  1 2000]
&gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid:  tbutils-0240: 
&gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: *** Error: Invalid ACPI table checksum
&gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: nsapinam-0058: 
&gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: DSDT is not in memory
&gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: OsdBreakpoint: Fatal error encountered

It means the acpi subsystem was unable to load the tables, apparently due to
an invalid checksum.

&gt; 2. from pm.txt
&gt;   "If a working ACPI implementation is found, the
&gt; ACPI driver will override and disable APM, otherwise the APM driver
&gt; will be used."
&gt; What is meant here by -working-

There are a number of tables that the bios provides, which the ACPI
subsystem consumes. These tables have to be laid out properly (checksums
work out, no illegal grammar, etc.) for ACPI to work. It looks like what may
be happening in your case is that your system has some ACPI support (or we
wouldn't be finding any tables) but that they're not correctly formatted.
Just a guess. Does IBM have any bios updates for that machine?

&gt; 3. Does anybody have acpi working to their advantage?

Yep. But, please realize that all the features of ACPI are not fully
implemented yet, i.e. it's still under active development.

&gt; 4. What does DSDT stand for?

Differentiated System Description Table. This is where the motherboard's
resources are described, in Acpi Machine Language (AML).

&gt; 5. Do any of the above error msgs make sense to anybody.

Yep ;-) The interpreter currently in the kernel releases has had most of the
debug output removed, but the plans are to have a patch which reincorporates
these, for debugging.

&gt; 6. Is there any *real* advantage to acpi vs apm?

Basically, APM is bad because the bios is in charge of power management, but
the OS is the one in the system which really has the best idea of what to
do. So, ACPI moves PM into the OS, but still relies on the bios for the
platform specific tables. It's still dependent on the platform bios, but not
as much.

IA64 also requires ACPI support.

&gt; 7. Has it been implemented in *any* drivers?

I don't think so. That's a big job that's coming up.

Regards -- Andy

&gt; &gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: DSDT is not in memory
&gt; &gt; Aug  1 22:03:12 aar acpid: OsdBreakpoint: Fatal error encountered
&gt; 
&gt; It means the acpi subsystem was unable to load the tables, apparently due to
&gt; an invalid checksum.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. from pm.txt
&gt; &gt;   "If a working ACPI implementation is found, the
&gt; &gt; ACPI driver will override and disable APM, otherwise the APM driver
&gt; &gt; will be used."
&gt; &gt; What is meant here by -working-
&gt; 
&gt; There are a number of tables that the bios provides, which the ACPI
&gt; subsystem consumes. These tables have to be laid out properly (checksums
&gt; work out, no illegal grammar, etc.) for ACPI to work. It looks like what may
&gt; be happening in your case is that your system has some ACPI support (or we
&gt; wouldn't be finding any tables) but that they're not correctly formatted.
&gt; Just a guess. Does IBM have any bios updates for that machine?

It is a pre-flash machine, IBM 380XD, PIIX4, mobile pentium. 
The other tables are present.

&gt; &gt; 3. Does anybody have acpi working to their advantage?
&gt; 
&gt; Yep. But, please realize that all the features of ACPI are not fully
&gt; implemented yet, i.e. it's still under active development.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. What does DSDT stand for?
&gt; 
&gt; Differentiated System Description Table. This is where the motherboard's
&gt; resources are described, in Acpi Machine Language (AML).

Is there a way to build a correct substitute? The motherboard's
resources are
known.
If not, then I think it is a bug to treat acpi as working on this
machine, and it should have reverted to apm.

&gt; &gt; 5. Do any of the above error msgs make sense to anybody.
&gt; 
&gt; Yep ;-) The interpreter currently in the kernel releases has had most of the
&gt; debug output removed, but the plans are to have a patch which reincorporates
&gt; these, for debugging.

I did not activate the interpreter because 120k seemed a bit much.

&gt; &gt; 6. Is there any *real* advantage to acpi vs apm?
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, APM is bad because the bios is in charge of power management, but
&gt; the OS is the one in the system which really has the best idea of what to
&gt; do. So, ACPI moves PM into the OS, but still relies on the bios for the
&gt; platform specific tables. It's still dependent on the platform bios, but not
&gt; as much.
&gt; 
&gt; IA64 also requires ACPI support.

That answers the question I did not ask for fear of sounding like a
flame:
Q. Why did ACPI go in so late in 2.3? 
A. for IA64

&gt; &gt; 7. Has it been implemented in *any* drivers?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think so. That's a big job that's coming up.
&gt;

Thanks for the great response.

Hi,

as some people have noticed, the list of BIOSes on
http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/bios.sql is a bit outdated. I'd like to
change that, but before we start to gather information, I'd like to have
an your opinion what we should collect.

Currently this is:
 - Mainboard name and revision
 - BIOS revision (both visible and code in the FACP)
 - BIOS vendor/product code
 - Wakeup latency values for S2-S4
 - Width of the processor throttling register
 - Presence of BOOT and APIC table

Subject: "ACPI is not safe for SMP"

hi all,


I don't know why people feel like removing ACPI on smp boxes,
but I've found this below :
http://www.asuscom.de/Products/Techref/Acpi/solution.html
this is actually a hardware flaw on some Asus motherboards that
will load the second CPU with spurious interrupts 50% of its time, no matter what.

It's definitely NOT kernel related then.

Now you might have other good reasons to disable acpi that I am not aware of,
so ...

I haven't got ACPI working to my satisfaction yet. So in the meantime, in an
effort to preserve suspension I have done some other things.  

setterm -powersave on (turns on suspension for console)
setterm -store		(saves settings as default)

Enabled DPMS in X 4.0.1 so X session would suspend properly. I just thought I
would share this because it seemed some what difficult to find information on
this on the Internet, especially setterm settings. So at the very least, this
will suspend the monitor while trying to figure ACPI. Although it makes it more
complicated because I have to figure out which one is actually doing the
suspension. Easiest solution seems to be to remember the times that are set,
and time it with a watch to see if it is one of these methods (set to unusually
long times) or ACPI that is working. 

Casey

now there's now adding .en to the URLs anymore. If your languages are not

However, I'd suggest you configure your browser to accept "en" as a

Subject: ACPI error during boot

Hello to everybody !

	I'm using the linux-2.4.0.test6 kernel and I noticed the
following error during the boot time:


 devfs: v0.102 (20000622) Richard Gooch (rgooch@atnf.csiro.au)
devfs: boot_options: 0x0
kmem_create: Forcing size word alignment - nfs_fh

ACPI:         -0176: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Error: Object type returned from

ACPI:         -0176: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Error: Object type returned from
interpreter differs from expected value
ACPI: S1 supported
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Mounted devfs on /dev


Can somebody explain what this is and if it has to be fixed some way ?

I have an SMP dual PII350 box.

Thank you in advance and best regards

Yes, pardon me, I didn't mean it *was* fixed, but rather that we should fix
it (and the others) at some point. ;-)

The attached patch shows up three places where sleep_on_interruptible() is
used unsafely. I think it would be useful to include it at least briefly to
locate other abusers.

One could cause kswapd to miss wake-ups, which is not fatal but hardly 
ideal. (mm/vmscan.c:604)

One could cause a user to miss events which arrive just as they're trying 
to read /proc/sys/acpi/event (drivers/acpi/driver.c:162)

The third could cause the acpi thread to fail to wake up and service a
queued task (drivers/acpi/driver.c:333)

Hi all,

This patch fixes the Makefile in drivers/acpi so that it doesn't compile
unconditionally. It also adds makefiles to all the subdirectories, and
renames tables.c to table.c, so that the .o files don't collide. It is
against 2.4.test6. (I did notice it's still relinking too much, but this is
a start..)

Hi,

I'd like to do a hardware upgrade on phobos next Friday, 12:00 CET. The
machine will be down for a few minutes.

   Simon

PS: For those who have noticed: The forty minutes downtime today were due
to an unscheduled power outage.

&gt; the complete 192MB available. Unfortunately, the ACPI tables lived in
&gt; the last megabyte of memory, so as soon as the system got an ACPI
&gt; event, it locked. We solved it by using "mem=191M" on the command line
&gt; (instead of using all 192 MB).

Erik-

	Thank you so much for your idea.  Apparently, it is ACPI related, though I am
afraid I must disagree with you on the nature, at least in my case.  I disabled
the upper megabyte per your suggestion.  Now no ACPI functionality works.  My
ACPI table also includes a ACPI data and ACPI NVS region ( IOS-e820:
0000000000008000 @ 0000000007ff0000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000008000 @ 0000000007ff8000 (ACPI NVS)).

	My screen now does not power down, and the lockup is gone.

If anyone has any idea of what might be going on, please let me know (Erik may
be correct and I just have a little more screwiness).

Hi,

although not directly related ACPI, this might be interesting for those
who don't have S4BIOS.

Subject: Software Suspend v7a

Hi Gabor,

as I needed to install Linux-2.2.16 on my laptop, I had to work on your 
software-suspend patch again: There were many changes in apm.c that broke
your v7 patch.

I created v7a, which works fine for me with 2.2.16 (actually 2.2.16-SuSE,
which is rather similar to a 2.2.17-pre1x.)
Find it on

Enjoy!

["bug_report" (TEXT/PLAIN)]

1. Linux APIC errors and ACPI causes my machine to shutdown.

2. I'm using linux-2.4.0-test7 and the problem seems to be somewhat odd.
I can't nail it to any certain program or any certain process.  Anyways,
if I enable ACPI in my BIOS (with the noapic tag removed from boot), my
machine shuts down.  Also, I get APIC errors, regardless of whether or
not I put in "noapic" on the boot line and here's a sample of what I get...

APIC error on CPU1: 00(04)
APIC error on CPU0: 00(08)
APIC error on CPU1: 04(04)
APIC error on CPU0: 08(02)
APIC error on CPU0: 02(04)
APIC error on CPU1: 04(08)

Some of it doesn't even make sense according to the comments in the apic
code and I'm not even sure how it's called.

3. kernel, ACPI APIC

	It's a Abit BP6 Motherboard.  I don't overclock it.  I use the RU Bios.
I do have a 3dfx module (that I edited so it'd work in 2.4), but I don't have
that loaded.  I'm running dnetc in the background, and X with all the nice
gui programs out there (gnome, sawfish, netscape, gaim running generally).
If you need any more info, let me know via the reply-to email.... on the
plus side, my tv tuner works and unloads right, and I'm happy for that too!
I've also included the kernel config I used.

&gt; 1. Linux APIC errors and ACPI causes my machine to shutdown.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. I'm using linux-2.4.0-test7 and the problem seems to be somewhat odd.
&gt; I can't nail it to any certain program or any certain process.  Anyways,
&gt; if I enable ACPI in my BIOS (with the noapic tag removed from boot), my
&gt; machine shuts down.  Also, I get APIC errors, regardless of whether or
&gt; not I put in "noapic" on the boot line and here's a sample of what I get...
&gt; 
&gt; APIC error on CPU1: 00(04)
&gt; APIC error on CPU0: 00(08)
&gt; APIC error on CPU1: 04(04)
&gt; APIC error on CPU0: 08(02)
&gt; APIC error on CPU0: 02(04)
&gt; APIC error on CPU1: 04(08)
&gt; 
&gt; Some of it doesn't even make sense according to the comments in the apic
&gt; code and I'm not even sure how it's called.

I think the first thing to do is read Documentation/CHANGES before running \
anything(modutils.....), next the ACPI is notoriously buggy on BP6 Mobo (i have one, \
so.....) so perhaps you should consider setting it off.

I think the CHANGES file should be changes for something with a file giving software \
requirement and another giving real changes(perhaps the fixed part of the 2.4 TODO \
page ), that certainly avoid having people reporting bugs when they run wrong \
modutils for exemple......

&gt;For information, the bios is a Phoenix, rev R0114Z1 / RK114Z1,
&gt;which is acpi compliant.

FWIW, the latest revision (in my Z600) is R0116Z1 / RK116Z1. I have no
clue what has changed compared to earlier revisions.

The only indication that something "meaningful" has changed is that for
early Z600 BIOSes there are a number of reports about network hangs after
a suspend - with my BIOS, I can suspend and hibernate and completely
resurrect the network (Samba, Internet) via /etc/rc.d/init.d/network
restart.

I am currently using a Sony Vaio Z600RE notebook with a 2.2.14 kernel
(stock RedHat 6.2) and am exceedingly happy with the power management
features I can get to work: Suspend (to memory) works, Hibernate (to disk)
works - in every conceivable situation, perfectly.

The only thing I am not happy about is the amount of heat the machine
produces. It is my understanding that the Mobile PIII (500) that's in the
Vaio can be configured somehow to work in some sort of "power saving
mode". It is also my understanding that using ACPI I could accomplish
that.

IOW, I currently do not care (that much) about performance, but I want to
extend the battery's life as much as possible (and reduce that heat :-&gt;).

Is there a way that I could get the PIII into this "permanent" power
saving mode with a 2.2.14 kernel? 

I'd be happy to be a guinea pig for a 2.4pre kernel, as long as the docs
on how to upgrade from 2.2.14 to 2.4pre are crystal clear and as long I
can easily *revert back* to a working kernel. Oh, and I definitiely don't
want to loose suspend + hibernate (some messages in the archive made me a
bit nervous about that bit).

Any thoughts?

Thanks very much,
Stefan

	Hello !

I have an asus k7v motherboard (athlon base system) and acpi doesn't seem
to work. I have all the tools (acpid), tried the latest kernel 2.4.0-test3
and the computer hangs if I start acpid (for previous kernel) or if I use
kernel 2.4 with acpi interpreter.
The only solution for previous kernel is to boot with acpi=no-c3
option. But in this case, the computer can't poweroff or standby when
requested...

I have emailed many times and didn't receive any answers. If anyone has the
same motherboard with acpi working, please let me know.

Thank you.

Hi,

I'd like to change all occurences of the long version of our hostname to
the shorter CNAME, but this will also mean that the envelope from address
and the the X-List-Id field will change (which some of you might use for
filtering).

If there are no objections, I'd change on Friday, 10pm CET DST, which
should be a time where most of the readers are awake (Sorry to the folks
in Japan :-/).

Kernel 2.4.0-test4-pre6 hangs my Sony VAIO N505VE hard during boot...
"ACPI: support found" prints, and then... nada, hard freeze.

Prior to 2.4.0-test3 kernels with ACPI support had no such problems,
and ACPI /seemed/ to recognize the systems capabilities, but sleep
did not work (system would freeze on sleep).

I'm back with my Maestro and sluggish system problem ;)

Is there a reason why no-c2, no-c3 was removed?  (test4-pre6).
C3 is giving me fits.  My kernel says:

ACPI: support found 
ACPI: PBLK 0 @ 0x1010:6 
ACPI: C2 supported 
ACPI: 7 throttling states 
ACPI: S1 supported 
ACPI: S5 supported 
ACPI: found EC @ (0x62,0x66,9) 

However, the ACPI thread reports:

C2 works ok
C3 works ok

which it (C3) doesn't, at least with my Maestro.

Why would C3 be used if it isn't supported?  In the past, if I did
acpi=no-c3 in lilo.conf, things worked ok.  I'm guessing that this
is a bug?

Debugging this has been a PITA because I can only load the acpi
interpreter module about three times before the machine powers down - on
the fourth attempt it just powers down immediately.

It appears that acpi_ns_lookup() called from around line 272 of
dispatcher/dswload.c (in acpi_ds_load2_begin_op()) is failing to find
"DBG1".

DSDT disassembly attached. This is a BP6 with the latest (RU) BIOS. Is
this their fault or ours, and if the former, can we do anything to work
round it?

APM and ACPI with OS-directed power management should reduce your notebook
power consumption to a few watts max when idle. This depends on the level of
hardware power management implemented by your system. APM or ACPI/OSPM can
take advantage of the hw power management provided. When idle the CPU and
chipset is placed into a low power state. If idle long enough, other devices
should also be turned off (e.g. audio, disk, etc).

Hi,

Does anybody knows the answer to this question, or some partial 
answers?  Thanks!

"When my notebook is idle (for a 5-min coffee break), it still takes nearly 
10 W.  This excludes the display, the hard disk, the network card.  Pentium 
idle instruction (hlt) is used.  Is this 10W consumed by chips on the 
motherboard?  Does APM or ACPI help?"

I don't think APM helps reducing idle power due to chipsets unless entering 
suspend mode.  How about ACPI?

&gt;From looking at the ACPI source, I'm guessing:

&gt;	-0061 Warning: RSDP structure not found

means ACPI won't work on this board?

Is that correct?

If not, can anyone suggest a debugging procedure?

Thanks,

&gt; &gt; what your asking for is a feature which is not supported by APM. It is,

Greetings. Can I expect my acer travelmate 505T notebook, that has
ACPI power management, to work smoothly if I install
Redhat 6.2 (or earlier versions) without installing ACPI enabled
kernel, the acpi libraries and software? I originally
repartitioned my harddrive to have win98 and linux side by side. But
after this, both linux and win98 started failing terribly (freezing
and crashing with disk write errors). I read somewhere that win98 
powermanagement software possibly corrupts the linux partition
($%&amp;/=§"!$.)

I tried reinstalling win98 with the recovery-cd that came with the
notebook
(without the linux partition this time) and still win98 the same problems
as
before. Then I reinstalled linux (without win98)
and I still have problems ('ls' command crashes with segmentation fault)

Your opinions are welcome...

P.S. I am a fairly experienced software developer (right!!!) and I will 
gladly help the ACPI group with development work if there is some...

  Basically the acpi part doesn't really work after the kernel detection =

 Of course these are just the ACPI related stuff.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI interpreter on ACPI-tableless systems


Hi,

this patch make ACPI interpreter useful on systems without
BIOS-provided ACPI tables (at least for VIA chipsets).

Patch consist of 2 parts:
	- disable SCI/SMI mode switching when SCI IRQ == 0;
	- /proc/sys/sX_slp_typ (X = 0,1,5) proc entries are back.
	  These entries are required for power off (at least on my
	  machine :)

Best wishes,
	Andrey

Once, with the old acpi, I was able to get the laptop working by enabling
acpi-irq when enabling the acpi.
Now, with the new code layout the patch is no more possible neither easy.
The irq is set in the interpreter and I don't see a clean way of maintaining
the behaviour that works with my laptop.

I admit that my modification is a ugly hack.
I never understood why it's up to the acpid daemon to enable the acpi and
what is the daemon now supposed to do ?
the kernel stays for a long time with the acpi-irq enabled but the acpi
disabled.
Is it a correct way of working regarding the acpi specs ?
Moreover, pcmcia is not working, and the embedded Ethernet controler (a
tulip one) is no more working when
acpi is on. Maybe the interrupt scheme expected by the bios is different
thant the one set by the kernel.
I remembered having read a statement in the spec that says: if the acpi is
to be used, then all devices that are acpi aware
must be initialized by the ACPI interpreter. So, all devices are not
initialized by the ACPI and maybe it's the source of problem.
Where can I find in the tables the method or ressources allocated by each
device (the reserved interrupts and IO) ?


Any help is welcome.

Hi, I compiled with ACPI support in my 2.4.0-test4 kernel and I'm
running acpid, and everything "seem" to work, at least nothing is
complaining.  This is a Dell Latitude LSt.

But with APM my fan used to be go on when I started compiling things,
with ACPI the fan never seem to go on no matter what I do.  Is this a
configuration issue?

And with APM I could type "apm" to see battery status, how do I do
this with ACPI?

I've reverted to APM meanwhile.

Yes, the zone file for the shorter names seems to be more recent than the

Hi,

Does anybody knows the answer to this question, or some partial 
answers?  Thanks!

"When my notebook is idle (for a 5-min coffee break), it still takes nearly 
10 W.  This excludes the display, the hard disk, the network card.  Pentium 
idle instruction (hlt) is used.  Is this 10W consumed by chips on the 
motherboard?  Does APM or ACPI help?"

I don't think APM helps reducing idle power due to chipsets unless entering 
suspend mode.  How about ACPI?

I'm trying to get ACPI working on an I-Opener running Jailbait V6 (v
2.2.4test4 kernel).

At boot, I get two ACPI error messages:

-0061 Warning: RSDP structure not found
-0550 Success: namespace and objects deleted p1 p2 &lt; p5 p6 p7 p8 &gt;

After boot, there's no /proc/sys/acpi directory.  I didn't compile APM
in, so the power switch no longer works at all.  Note: I'm not running
the acpid yet, I figure without /proc/sys/acpi it won't work anyway.

What did I do wrong?

If I can get acpi working, what must I do to make the power-off message
cause a standby?

Thanks,

Chris

&gt; what your asking for is a feature which is not supported by APM. It is,

Hello,
I'm writing a small driver for an ACPI-compatible embedded controller,
and I would like to know how to register a gpe event handler.

What I do is (don't worry it it looks bad ;):

extern "C"
{
  #include "/usr/local/src/linux/drivers/acpi/include/acpi.h"
  #include "/usr/local/src/linux/drivers/acpi/include/acpixf.h"
}

extern "C" void Generic_GPE_handler( void *pCtxt )
{
  CAcpiEvt *pEvt = (CAcpiEvt*)pCtxt;
  pEvt-&gt;OnIrq();
}

int CAcpiEvt::VReserve()
{
  return acpi_install_gpe_handler( m_iGpeBit,
                                   ACPI_GPE_EDGE_TRIGGERED,
                                   Generic_GPE_handler, this );
}

void CAcpiEvt::VFree()
{
  acpi_remove_gpe_handler( m_iGpeBit, Generic_GPE_handler );
}

Compile is fine, but my module won't load :
stevebook/home/steve/src/ddk# insmod -pv mymod.o
Using mymod.o
Symbol version prefix 'smp_'
mymod.o: unresolved symbol acpi_remove_gpe_handler
mymod.o: unresolved symbol acpi_install_gpe_handler

Where have the symbols gone ? evxface.c has been compiled during
the kernel build, the functions are in the kernel map,
but once I booted, they are not in /proc/ksyms.

For info, the kernel is a 2.4.0-test3, with full acpi support.

Did I miss something (maybe a problem because my kernel build is smp ?
And is there something else needed to initialize acpi before I can do
such an install_gpe_handler ?

Thanks in advance,

  Steve

The reason is that multi-views isn't turned on on the web page.  The en
specifies the language the page is in.  Your browser sends a request to
the server that has a language code in it.  That language code is used by
the server to determine which page should be viewed.  The feature of
Apache that does this is commonly termed "MultiViews".  If this isn't on
or it isn't configured properly, then the server can't figure out the
correct page to send back.  By adding the .en, you tell the server that is
the exact page you want.

That is probably more information than you wanted, but I figure the more
explanation, the better.

Hello. I don't subscribe to your list, so please respond directly to my email address.
We're being asked to write an X-server for Linux for a device that gets its frame-buffer
memory from system memory. It relies on the operating system's support of the ACPI
GetSystemMap function to properly "steal" the system memory. Under windows it looks like
any other memory-mapped PCI device, you just map from a physical address to a linear
address and you've got access to the frame buffer.

Does any version of the Linux kernel use the GetSystemMap interrupt for determining the
system memory layout? If not, as that part of the project you folks are doing?

Thanks,

&gt;Miachel, thanks for the info. That is exactly what I'm looking for. However, I see that
&gt;not even the 2.2.14 kernel provided with RH6.2 implements this functionality. I don't see
&gt;it being used until the 2.3.99 kernel. Am I missing something . . . . or is this what you
&gt;meant as "Modern"? (I assumed 6.2 would be considered "modern".)

Sorry, I was looking at the 2.3.99 kernel sources and thought I was
looking at the 2.2.14 kernel sources; my mistake (I thought I had my
/usr/src/linux symlink pointing to the 2.2.14 sources and went straight
to /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel without looking to see where I was).
So I was wrong to use the word "Modern".  "Development" would have been
the right word.  Sorry about that.

That said, I don't have 2.2.15 or 2.2.16 sources handy to look at to
see if e820 handling got in to the stable kernel in any form recently.
But I agree that I don't see e820 handling in the 2.2.14 source tree.

Zach,

I'd be happy to work with you on this.  BTW, it seems I spoke
too soon about use_pm=0.  I only though it worked;)  I get

maestro: APU register select failed.
(message repeated 399 times)
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x0.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x7c.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x7e.

maestro: AC97 Codec detected: v: 0x 0 0 caps: 0x0 pwr: 0x0
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0xe.
maestro: 1 channels configured.

when I "insmod maestro use_pm=0".  Dunno if these are bad
news or not, but maybe the ac97 does come into play somehow.

I'll try turning off the C-states as well.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Otherwise, Zach, you are adding D-state support
&gt; &gt; to the Maestro, right? (cool, by the way)  Have
&gt; &gt; you seen this?
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't, no, but I haven't gotten much feedback on the apm code
&gt; in general :)  
&gt; 
&gt; The Maestro power management stuff in the existing driver is pretty
&gt; danged minimal.  It was only added because when win&lt;something&gt; shutdown
&gt; it left the maestro shutdown and a soft reboot to linux meant your
&gt; maestro didn't work anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; The maestro chip has config registers to say what parts
&gt; of the chip should have their clocks fed.  When we don't have any
&gt; devices open, we drop the clock to almost all the units.  I don't
&gt; honestly know if this reduces the load the chip draws at all, but it
&gt; probably should :)  More importantly, paying attention to power
&gt; management stuff made the maestro come to life after win had suspended
&gt; it :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure exactly what the problem could be.  It sounds like
&gt; the chip is making the world very unhappy when its suspended, I would
&gt; guess this is 'cause its causing small mountains of spurious ints on the
&gt; bus or is doing Evil Things while messing up legacy bus snooping.  I'm
&gt; not at all sure why the hell it would do either of these things :)  My
&gt; first experiment would be to mess around with the set of units that have
&gt; their clocks disabled.  
&gt; 
&gt; Also interesting is the fact that the current PM code does absolutely
&gt; nothing with the AC97.  Dell may have wired things so that powering down
&gt; things without paying attention to the ac97 does bad stuff.  I dunno.
&gt; 
&gt; So, 'got me', but I'll work with someone whose interested in playing
&gt; with it :)   I don't have maestro hardware at the moment, let alone
&gt; maestro hardware that I could play with power management on..

	Hi there,

I'm quite new with ACPI stuff, but very interested in.
I recently bough a Sony Vaio Z600, and stuff like the
power button didn't seem to work properly with ACPI
(undetected in fact).

I tried an echo "0xffffffff" &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/pm1_enable,
which in return was set to 0x00000521, in order to see
the more events that could come from detected devices.

Then cat /proc/sys/acpi/events revealed nothing while
pressing the power button or the small wheel (what they
call Jog Dial @ Sony)

For information, the bios is a Phoenix, rev R0114Z1 / RK114Z1,
which is acpi compliant.

Some devices are detected correctly, anyway patched a little
acpianalyze to have all devices displayed, even if I don't know what
they all are (even if I can guess) :

acpianalyze: found Processor #0 _PR_.CPU0 (PBLK 0x00008010 - 0x00008016)

(Every "Unknown device" is returned by my patched match_hid function)

I'd like to have some pointers on the following points, in order to
help you.
- First, I didn't see a database of hardware types in the code,
  which might be useful, like what is done with lspci. It is
  really helpfull in debugging what devices are present, even
  if we don't handle them properly. We can also ask the people to report
  the missing data when they find something not recognized.
  If you give me the pointer, I'll write the basic stuff for acpianalyze
  to detect and report everything properly.
  (But maybe only a few hid are needed, not like the vendor:id pci
stuff.
   I'll read the specs tonight ;)

- Then, I wondered how it was that I didn't get any event.
  Is it possible to put all (or some) of the devices in the state
  where they trigger IRQs, and report every event, even
  if we don't know what to do with them ?
  (what I tried to enable with the 0xffffffff &gt; pm1_enable,
  without success).
  I feel this is really needed when debugging the hardware,
  mostly for unknown devices. How could this be done, I'd like
  to have this functionality, and I can spend some time on it.
  Do you have some pointers on that ? 

Sorry if some questions have already been answered, I read like
6 months of the mailing-list archives yesterday, it took me hours,
and I didn't see anything regarding that.

Thanks,

Eric

&gt;Hello. I don't subscribe to your list, so please respond directly to my email address.
&gt;We're being asked to write an X-server for Linux for a device that gets its frame-buffer
&gt;memory from system memory. It relies on the operating system's support of the ACPI
&gt;GetSystemMap function to properly "steal" the system memory. Under windows it looks like
&gt;any other memory-mapped PCI device, you just map from a physical address to a linear
&gt;address and you've got access to the frame buffer.
&gt;
&gt;Does any version of the Linux kernel use the GetSystemMap interrupt for determining the
&gt;system memory layout? If not, as that part of the project you folks are doing?

I don't have my ACPI standard handy at the moment, but I imagine that you
are referring to the map provided by the e820 extended memory query function.
Modern versions of Linux use that to find out about system memory.  You can
see the implementation, if you like, in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c

I hope that's useful.

Hello,

As per the subject.

When acpid is not running, everything is fine.

When acpid is running, the system is sluggish if no process
has /dev/dsp open (mouse movement is slower, etc).  It seems
to effect timekeeping in general, as (e.g.) the interval
between top redisplays is longer than normal.

The maestro docs (linux/Documentation/sound/Maestro) say
that when no program has /dev/dsp open, the maestro chip is
"shut down".  If /dev/dsp is opened, the system behavior
goes back to normal (acpid running).  I could quote the
docs, but if you've got a 2.3.x or 2.4.0pre you've got the
docs - look for "When using power management".

Now, I can fix this by module option (use_pm=0, disabling pm
for the sound chip), but I'd rather know why this happens.
Any hints?  The archives mention this laptop, but in
conjunction with a different problem.

I'm not on the list, please CC any replies.  Table dumps or
other info available on request.

Do you have the Maestro 2e as the sound chip?  I wonder if
maybe it's a firmware rev somewhere.  I bought mine last
November (500MHz PIII, 256MB, 15.4" panel).  BTW,
acpi=no-c2,no-c3 "fixes" the problem.

I notice that a lot of our acpi code uses vsprintf
instead of vsnprintf.  Because this really is
Linux-specific, where vsnprintf is always available,
and because vsnprintf implementations are floating
around, and because in the worst case you can do a
trivial function that ignores the length and converts
to vsprintf for impoverished platforms that are
lacking vsnprintf, could we switch basically
everything over to using vsnprintf?

The sooner we start working on potential buffer
overflows, the more secure we'll be.  And
remember that many buffer overflows do not start
because they were originally written as buffer
overflows; very often it is because code is
copied, or the environment changes and no one
notices; basically, code rot.

I'm making all sorts of suggestions today...

I'd like to suggest using popt for argument parsing,
for a variety of reasons.

First, it removes 90% of the "get_options" boilerplate that
Andy has written.  It removes several coding redundancies,
reducing the potential for errors when editing existing
code.  It can even, in most circumstances, remove entirely
the need for specifying the short options in triplicate
(struct option, getopt_long third argument, case statements)
and reduce them to a single instance.

Second, it has a great many features that getopt_long doesn't
have and that we might like, such as automatic help text
generation, table nesting (so that libraries can provide
common argument handling that is fully integrated in all
related applications), configurable argument handling and
argument aliasing via a text file, and recursion safety.

Third, it is available on all full Linux systems.  That is,
it is available on all systems that have RPM, and all Linux
distributions either are based on RPM or include it as a
component that can be installed.  To break that down, it is
available on Red Hat Linux, all distributions based on Red
Hat Linux, Debian, all distributions based on Debian, and
on Slackware.  Many other packages now depend on it,
including GNOME and ORBiT.

You can see how useful it is if you run, say,
gnome-terminal --help
All the help text you see there is auto-generated from the
tables that describe the argument parsing.  You can tell
which options apply to which package because they are labelled
and logically separated.

Also, once you require it for command-line parsing, it is
quite useful in other contexts.  It can be used, for example,
as the guts to a parser for configuration files with lines
that look like command lines.

It is portable enough to work on any POSIX platform, and this
has been tested in part because rpm has been ported to many
platforms (not just Unix, but amiga, windows, etc.) and popt
is a required component of rpm.

While it has been extended considerably from its original
implementation, the authors have maintained backwards
compatibility, and expect to continue to do so for the
forseeable future.

Finally, it is comprehensively documented in a style that is
easy to follow; read the popt man page to see what I'm talking
about.

A new version of acpid is available now from

 
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/

Changes
* Added Michael Johnson's latest patches
  (note that the popt library is now required
  to build acpictl)
* Added information about creating bug reports
  (see REPORTING-BUGS)
* Added an option (-t) to acpid to produce a (rather
  sizeable) debug trace which should help us
  track down, at the very least, crashes
  (see REPORTING-BUGS)
* A nifty AML debugger is turned on by default
  now when using -d.  Try "help".  Additional
  documentation will be available soon.

Simon Richter writes:
&gt;Actually I thought of using a separate daemon for this, acpipold. Users
&gt;that don't want to use complex policy management (such as on embedded
&gt;systems can use a separate (or cut down) daemon. Also, when acpid's
&gt;funktionality gets merged into the kernel, the only thing that would have
&gt;to be changed is the communications method to the kernel.

I'm suggesting that we have one tool that can act as a per-user
communications daemon instead of having to have precisely one
deamon for the whole system, and I'm suggesting that instead of
reimplementing the communication mechanism N times for N similar
tools, we make one program serve multiple functions.

I'm not convinced, either, that ALL of acpid's functionality will be
moved into the kernel.  The AML interpreter will, but most of the rest
of it will not.  I still expect, frankly, that when I open my socket,
that a user-space acpid will be on the other end of it, not a
kernel-space acpid.

Andy?

&gt;&gt; acpictl can be setuid or perhaps (on systems such as Red Hat Linux
&gt;&gt; that support it) managed via consolehelper.
&gt;
&gt;I'm using AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM sockets with SO_PASSCRED (Linux) or
&gt;SO_CREDENTIALS (NetBSD). This allows authentication without suid.

At some point, information created by an untrusted user needs to
pass into a trusted domain, and that information MUST be cleaned
up.  The smaller the domain in which it is cleaned, the easier
that domain is to secure.  That domain must have special privileges
in order to be trusted to do the cleaning.  It's really not an
issue whether those privileges are setuid or SO_PASSCRED; that's
an implementation detail that can be easily changed.

That's why I want a small tool that does simple translation and
testing, and which relies only on secure tools.

Understand that the parts of acpictl that are not touched by the
code patch in daemon mode do not have to be secured in the same
way, so they don't affect the domain size significantly.

&gt;&gt; In any case, it can have a configuration file that defines
&gt;&gt; what normal users are allowed to do: for example, are they allowed
&gt;&gt; to set policy or only to query values?
&gt;
&gt;Configuration is my greatest problem at this point. Having never used
&gt;bison before and not really having a clue how to write the rules in a
&gt;reasonable form. Some time ago, I hacked up a few rules, however they're
&gt;in broken English language rather than C. See also
&gt;
&gt;http://phobos.fs.tum.de/pipermail/acpi/1999-July/000073.html

I know how to write parsers, and I know how to write configuration
languages, it is what I've been doing for years.  Leave that to me.

The interesting part is specifying what things need to be configured,
figuring out what users really want to set.  However, if we effectively
force them to write a program to set the policy (in order, of course,
to be REALLY FLEXIBLE) most people will hate it, and acceptance will
be basically non-existant...   I think we need an entirely non-procedural
language that is capable of describing complete policy state.  Then
users, if they are allowed to do so by site policy, can send state
changes to the policy engine at will.

However, as long as we do not have programmatic policy, or the potential
for programmatic policy, that 0.01% of users who actualy want to be
able to store a program as policy will be unhappy with us.  They can
get programmatic policy by writing a perl or python program which
talks via acpictl to acpid, listens to events, and dynamically resets
the current policy state based on those events.  That will give us
programmatic policy without needless complexity for 99.99% of users.

That leaves us with creating a formal definition of policy state.
The description that you posted of things that people might like to
see is a start.  I'll try to go through it and write up a more formal
description, then I'll define a language that looks normal to people,
expresses it reasonably, and is easy to parse.

&gt;&gt; I imagine that some people
&gt;&gt; will want to set policies as normal users, and other people will
&gt;&gt; want just as strongly for normal users not to be allowed to set
&gt;&gt; policies.  Depends on the context.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, and people will want to set policies from their GNOME panels and MPEG
&gt;players ("While a MPEG is playing, don't blank the screen." You can't
&gt;imagine how many people have asked for this...)

As I say, some people will want it.  But I guarantee you that other
people will not want it ("If you put my webserver into quiet mode,
I'm going to HUNT YOU DOWN AND CASTRATE YOU!" :-) so that in itself
must be configurable.

&gt;&gt; I'm going to start working on this now, but if anyone has
&gt;&gt; any better ideas or improvements to this one, feel free to
&gt;&gt; propose them.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, it's been in CVS for a long time, however non-functional because I
&gt;can't think of a proper config format. The code is in CVS, in the
&gt;repository at /work/cvs/acpi, module acpipolicy (as announced on
&gt;development.html).

I'm sorry, could you give me a more complete reference than
"development.html"?

I'll look at acpipolicy, but I don't guarantee that I'm going to
follow that mold.

What about different "configuration backends"? If someone thinks he needs

nothing has changed. However, this isn't something we need to do.

Right, the interpreter and possibly some kind of
device manager is all that I foresee needing to go
into the kernel.  The interface between user and
kernel will probably consist of the ability to

  * run control methods and obtain the results
    (gives battery/AC, thermal, some device
     configuration and control, system indicators)
  * initiate suspend (S1-S5)
  * manage devices (list, configure, status,
    suspend individual devices)
  * get system events (buttons, lid, dock/undock)
  * get and set processor power (C-state) policy
  ? Am I missing anything here ?

Besides processor, all policy will probably go up
in userspace where it can be easily configured by
users and localized by Linux distributions.

acpid (or pmd?) will do the coordination between
user policy preferences and the needs of currently
running applications and control the user-kernel
interface accordingly.  acpictl should be a nice
interface for obtaining system status (battery,
thermal, etc.) from acpid, specifying user
preferences, or possibly even forcing the system
to suspend.  Alternately, if someone wanted to drop
acpid completely, the user-kernel interface should
be powerful enough to utilize directly for a
home-grown policy implementation.

I would rather see auditing take place as close to
the user as possible.  This means, better in acpictl
than in acpid.  Putting auditing in acpictl allows
us to lock down acpid and minimize security risks
at the system/daemon level.  It also gives Linux
distributions the flexibility to scrap acpictl,
keep acpid, and do their own auditing if they
prefer.

That's exactly what I proposed, modulo the library.  I'm not against the
library, but I suggest that it talk to the policy manager with a protocol
that we agree on, because it is not always convenient to link against a
library to "just do the right thing" because the library authors do not
always know what application authors will want.  Also, remember that
multiple implementations of a protocol tend to make the implementation
of the protocol more solid, and the protocol itself better-defined.
That's why the IETF requires at least two independent implementations
of any standard protocol.

&gt;User applications can only
&gt;see the library, so the communications protocol is exchangeable. Even the
&gt;daemon would be exchangeable (see below).

smaller.

Read the proposal I'm writing in a separate letter.  Basically, any
application that is allowed to set policy can modify the configuration
in response to events, which gives the potential for programmatic
policy configuration without imposing it on the vast majority who
simply do not want it.

In other words, I don't think we disagree here fundamentally, but I
think I have a concrete suggestion how to attain all desired ends.

&gt;&gt; That leaves us with creating a formal definition of policy state.

And that's the proposal I'm still working on.  :-)

The short summary is that I am trying to define an instantaneous policy
definition separate from a policy change mechanism.  I think we need to
keep the layers separate to avoid confusion.

Hello Andy,

I've got it with my MSI MS-6167 Rev. 1.0B (Irongate C4).
My Athlon 550 is running with 550 MHz and I use the "latest"
2.3.99-pre7-6 together and without Andrea's classzone-25.

I have the following in my rc.local file:

# Starting acpid
if [ -e /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ ]
then
       if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/acpid ]
       then
               echo "Starting acpid..."
               /usr/local/sbin/acpid
               echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ
       fi
fi

System can power down normally and sleep wen I do "echo 0|1 &gt;
/proc/sys/acpi/sleep".
But after the system goes sleeping I have to press the poweron button to
wake it up again. Now it goes directly to poweroff? :-(

Second.

After the acpid has started I get only ~1 KB/sec with pppd. My ppp
connections are so slow that I can't use them together with acpid
running. To solve the situation I have to reboot without starting acpid,
again.

I notice that acpica/control/ec/ec.c only looks at I/O-accessed, and not
memory-accessed ECs.  I presume that is because current ECs only are in
I/O space, but the standard allows for memory-accessed ECs, and if ACPI
ever does make it onto non-Intel platforms, that may include platforms
that don't have I/O space...

In EcAddDevice:
    if (ACPI_FAILURE(Status = EcGetPortValues(EmbeddedController)))
    {
        goto End;
    }
And then in EcGetPortValues (notice the weighted naming of the
function...  :-)
    if ((FirstResource-&gt;Id != Io) || (SecondResource-&gt;Id != Io))
    {
        Status = AE_BAD_DATA;
        goto End;
    }

Section 13.11 of the standard says, "Embedded Controler's [sic]
are considered static resources, hence only return their defined
resources.  The embedded controller resides only in system I/O
or memory space."

Andy, does the EC driver work on any machine yet?  Looks like mine
is bog-standard, but even after EcInitialize, acpid complains that
EC space is an unknown space and so hangs.

&gt;I looked at the trace, and it looks like it's
&gt;trying to get at EC space before calling
&gt;EcInitialize (that is, "EcInitialize" wasn't
&gt;in the trace at all and it was complaining
&gt;about unknown space 3); I'm really not clear
&gt;why that is happening, as I had to leave just
&gt;after I figured that out.  Back to work now,
&gt;I guess...

OK, that was mildly obvious:

BmInitialize depends on EcInitialize being called
if a battery uses an embedded controller.

But in bm.c, EcInitialize is called after BmInitialize,
so BmInitialize can't make the battery work.

I tried changing acpid_bm_init to
nt
acpid_bm_init(void)
{
        EcInitialize();
        PwInitialize();
        TzInitialize();
        BtInitialize();

        if (!ACPI_SUCCESS(BmInitialize()))
        {
                acpid_log(LOG_ERR, "BmInitialize failed");
                BtTerminate();
                TzTerminate();
                PwTerminate();
                EcTerminate();
                return -1;
        }


        acpid_enum_battery();
        acpid_enum_thermal();

        return 0;
}

But then I discovered that EcInitialize, for reasons I do not
understand, appears to depend on BmInitialize.  Here's the tail
of the trace with my new function:

acpid:  cmmutex-0193: 
acpid: Released Mutex  [MTX_Namespace] Status AE_OK
acpid:    evapi-0722: 
acpid:  01 Exiting Function: AcpiInstallAddressSpaceHandler, AE_OK
acpid:       ec-0255: 
acpid:  01 Entered Function: EcInitialize
acpid:       bm-0679: 
acpid:  02 Entered Function: BmRegisterControl
acpid:       bm-0597: 
acpid:  03 Entered Function: BmSearch

At this point it hangs (and segfaults when I send it a signal).

Andy, I don't think I have enough information about acpica
design to resolve this.

Simon wrote, long ago:
&gt;My ideas for handling this in userspace would be as follows:

I think you are making that way too complex.  You appear to be attempting
to turn Linux into Windows.

&gt; - If the program registers with libacpi, everything is fine, and we can
&gt;   expect the program to be able to tell when the computer and certain
&gt;   pieces of hardware may go to sleep and what provisions (such as
&gt;   wake-on-lan, wake-on-ring, ...) are required to allow turning off that
&gt;   hardware.

I wouldn't put it this way.  I'd say that IF allowed by local configuration,
programs can modify policies.  That's it.

&gt; - If the program does not have a controlling terminal and a UID in a
&gt;   defined (config) range, then it is considered a server. A server's
&gt;   requirements can be determined by querying different acpid modules to
&gt;   which I refer as "plugins". They query specific information such as
&gt;   whether it has any listening sockets and tell acpid their conclusions.
&gt;   The machine should go to sleep after a certain time of inactivity.

You don't need that.  /proc gives you enough information about the
network state to make decisions without worrying about specific
processes.  If there are established incoming connections, going
to sleep would be rude.

That gets rid of a lot of your rules.

Some of the rest of your rules seem to think that we are going to
be controlling the scheduler from acpid.  I'm not sure why you think
that.  ACPI shouldn't be putting individual processes to sleep.
And in terms of unused resources being put to sleep individually,
we don't need to know anything about individual programs; the pm
interface in the kernel should be sufficient.  The kernel is there
for resource management; use it.

&gt; - If a program is using io space directly, it cannot be put to sleep. It
&gt;   might leave the hardware in some weird state.

So much for X.

I would suggest that if a program has iopl set or has mmapped ioports
AND is in running state, then we should not go to sleep.  But if a
program is in running state, we probably shouldn't go to sleep anyway,
so there is no need for a special rule here.

&gt; - If the machine's load5 (the 5 seconds average) and load1 are below a
&gt;   point where the CPU can be clocked down without increasing the load to 
&gt;   1, the CPU gets clocked down.

Actually, it's simpler than that; this can be done with very
simple metrics that do not depend on load average calculations.
We can look at frequency and length of Cn states and if we are
spending enough time in Cn states, clock the processor down.
That would fit trivially into our current kernel-based framework.

&gt; - If a program requests a change to temperature management settings, the
&gt;   request is checked against the allowed values (config), then placed in
&gt;   a list. Precedence is given according to rules in the config and a
&gt;   self-defined priority. The priority is an estimate how serious the
&gt;   request is. If someone is working in the background and someone else at
&gt;   the console, they can manage to get along this way... hopefully. :-)

Even easier: no lists at all, no priorities at all.  You can either set
it, or you can't.  The API has a way to ask for "at least" or "at most"
which is done via get-change?-set?, and a way to store current values
to be restored.

If you have people logged remotely into your system, you don't need to
go to sleep.

&gt; - If an unimportant program (see above) is running, and the system is
&gt;   battery powered, acpid issues a priority 0 TM request that puts the
&gt;   machine into power-saving mode, which is basically the same as silent
&gt;   mode.

Not necessarily what the user wants.  This is easily configurable.

&gt;Home user/Workstation:
&gt; - Many local X connections
&gt;    We don't care about that. These are local connections, as long as the
&gt;    kernel is aware of it (Max? :-) ), they won't time out.

There is no problem here.  People with APM suspend to disk for days
with X running.

&gt; - Few remote X connections
&gt;    It is the duty of the X server to notify/state-save all of its
&gt;    clients. If all of the clients are ACPI aware, this should not be a
&gt;    great problem, since the (not yet existant) specification for aware
&gt;    clients tells how to react (close the connection and wait for
&gt;    notification from the server). If not, we have a real problem. Open a
&gt;    window that informs the user about the problem, and ask for a
&gt;    solution. Also, I cannot offer you a solution if the user forgets
&gt;    about his clients. Sorry.

No.

1) The X server is not involved in session management any more than
   it is involved in window management.

2) Session management is not a complete save/restore state.  It should
   only be done at the user's explicit request.

If there are remote X connections, don't go to sleep.  X is chatty.

&gt; - Some local daemons that are idle most of the time
&gt;    This is no real problem. Servers may be put to sleep as long as they
&gt;    do not have any active non-local connections, and with the appropriate
&gt;    plugins that should not be difficult to detect.

Again, no need for plugins.  We can get network state from proc without
daemon-specific plugins.

&gt;Home server:
&gt; - A few gatewayed connections, depending on whether someone is working
&gt;    While these connections are active, the networking subsystem may not
&gt;    sleep.

Again, nothing special, we know how to get network state.

&gt; - Some daemons that are used sometimes, depending on whether someone is
&gt;   working
&gt;    As long as noone is working, the machine may sleep with wake-on-lan,
&gt;    as soon as someone connects, it needs to wake up. The plugins cat tell
&gt;    you how fast.

This is an example of one particular policy that someone might want to
put into place, or might not.

&gt; - Some cron jobs
&gt;    Cron should be ACPI aware, or we're having a huge problem here.

No need, just use anacron.  It works with APM, and it will work with
ACPI with no problem.

&gt; - Exported filesystems
&gt;    These daemons should be ACPI aware if you want the system to be able
&gt;    to sleep. Sorry.

If you have a network connection, don't go to sleep.  If you don't, then
it's not a problem.  You are again manufacturing problems.

&gt;Small business server:
&gt; - Some server programs being active during normal work hours
&gt;    This should keep the network and hard disk subsystems running
&gt; - Casual activity during the nights/weekends
&gt;    The server programs stay running, since noone is connected, acpid
&gt;    initiates sleep mode with wake-on-lan

You can have cron jobs that install different policy sets at different
times.  Nice and trivial.

&gt;Server: Constant activity keeps all relevant subsystems up.

Even easier...

&gt;Laptop:
&gt; - Battery troubles
&gt;    Every program that can give trouble, in fact those that access
&gt;    hardware directly, should be ACPI aware. If they are not, the only
&gt;    thing we can do is try to maintain device context as long as possible
&gt;    by turning off everything else, and kill the program if there is no
&gt;    other way. Active servers are only a minor problem, since a laptop
&gt;    that is connected to a network is usually also connected to a power
&gt;    source. If not, however, all we can do is refuse to accept() if the
&gt;    battery is low, and thus hope to get the connection table cleared
&gt;    until it gets really critical.

Easier than this, just have the battery monitor program warn the user
to do something intelligent.  And guess what, they already do!  We
just need to export battery status to the battery monitor programs.

The accept() hack won't work.  Slowing down incoming identd() requests
will just keep the connection table full of established outgoing
connections.

Keep it simple!

&gt; - libacpi
&gt;   The interface library for all programs that need to interface the local
&gt;   ACPI subsystem. 

This should talk to my proposed acpictl intermediary program.

&gt; - libXacpi

No need.

&gt; - some ACPI awareness patches
&gt;   X, cron, init, atd, ...

For X, there are two possibilities: systems whose AML code is
correct and which save the graphics state correctly on sleep,
and those that are broken.  As a workaround for broken systems,
we already know what to do, because APM has the right workaround:
switch to a text virtual console.  I can do a better job of it
than APM does -- they aren't taking advantage of the VC interface
as well as they could, but it's really not difficult programming.

Since this has gotten so long, I'll start working on concrete
policy definition in another email.

I have been trying to get ACPI working with my Microstar ALi chipset
motherboard.

After some experimentaion I have managed to get the ACPI driver loaded.  I
had to set 15-16Mb hole in the BIOS otherwise the BIOS would forget to
reserve the ACPI tables?!?

Anyway when I have acpid it doesn't seem to do anything, including power
off on shutdown.

How can I test whether it is working or not?

Hmm..  I might be tempted to leave the request_irq
in acpi_init.  This allows the ACPI driver to detect
interrupt conflicts when it initializes, rather than
much later when it goes to turn on ACPI.

If the problem is what I think, this should also
work

  ...

&gt; This interrupt got called again and again. I freeze

So, I forget, the ACPI interrupt is being shared
with your ethernet card?  If so, I would expect a
lot of interrupts to come in from the ethernet
card.  Perhaps your ACPI implementation doesn't
like to be polled (to see if ACPI is the source
of the interrupt) before it is enabled?  If so,
the above patch should fix.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Andy

I'm apparently the only one on this list for the past 48 hours :).
I just wanted to give some report about my investigation.
As I expected, putting the request_irq in the acpi_enable worked for me.

irq is reclaimed only when acpid issues the acpi_enable. Is this
behaviour againts the specs ?
I don't think so. Do you think this way of dealing is correct?
Next for my card (Dec tulip 21143), I put some debug in the driver.
As expected, the interrupt got called again and again.
The text of the loop is as follows:
--------------------------------------------
eth0: interrupt csr5= 0xf0000000 new csr5 = 0xf0000000
eth0: in rx suspend mode: (#) (tp-&gt;cur_rx = 0, ttimer = 1,rx = 0) go /
stay in suspend mode
eth0: exiting interrupt, csr5 = 0xf0000000
--------------------------------------------

Then, I looked at the code. All happens in the interrupt function.
The rx_buffers[entry].skb is NULL.
Something is wrong in the driver logic I think.
This interrupt got called again and again. I freeze after the counter
(the # mark in the extract of the log) goes up to 32.
Any clue guys ?

Try loading your NIC as a module, and see if that helps.  Also, if you can,
set your NIC to a different IRQ.
(Then figure out how to properly filter the interupts.)

Sorry, I was missing a ":-)" there.

&gt;Even easier: no lists at all, no priorities at all.  You can either set
&gt;it, or you can't.  The API has a way to ask for "at least" or "at most"
&gt;which is done via get-change?-set?, and a way to store current values
&gt;to be restored.

I'm starting to think that I was making it too simple here.  How about
this, instead:

A program can change policy.  It can do that in one of several ways:
 o  It can simply change the current policy
 o  It can conditionally change the current policy ("I need at least
    50% CPU speed, but if the current CPU speed is higher, do not
    lower it to 50%")
 o  It can request a temporary change
A temporary change is removed when requested or when the program
severs its connection (explicitly or implicitly via termination),
whichever comes first.  A temporary change is the only kind that
is stacked.

Rules like that will help keep the policy stack from turning into
a free-for-all memory leak (like, ahem, X shared memory segments... :-)

I'm not sure about attaching priorities to temporary changes; I
think it is likely to end up being unnecessary complication.

Sorry for the occasionally harsh tone of that mail; it was late and
I was tired and hungry...  Didn't mean it to sound that way.

The machine should go to sleep when the sleep button is pressed even if
there are programs running. The only exception should be if this breaks

The above rule is mainly about CPU throttling vs. fans.

Missing words tend to give sentences new meanings.

&gt; &gt;   battery powered, acpid issues a priority 0 TM request that puts the
&gt; &gt;   machine into power-saving mode, which is basically the same as silent
&gt; &gt;   mode.

&gt; Not necessarily what the user wants.  This is easily configurable.

This was to catch a special case: Laptop users running distributed.net
clients. This was a requested feature, nearly as often as disabling the
blanker during MPEG movies.

&gt; 1) The X server is not involved in session management any more than

Basically the right thing to do would be having the server notify xsm. I'm
working on this.

&gt; &gt; - Some local daemons that are idle most of the time
&gt; &gt;    This is no real problem. Servers may be put to sleep as long as they
&gt; &gt;    do not have any active non-local connections, and with the appropriate
&gt; &gt;    plugins that should not be difficult to detect.

&gt; Again, no need for plugins.  We can get network state from proc without
&gt; daemon-specific plugins.

I didn't think of daemon-specific plugins, but of network-stack (or
subsystem) specific ones. One such plugin would, for example, forbid
sleeping if the modem was active.

&gt; &gt; - Some cron jobs
&gt; &gt;    Cron should be ACPI aware, or we're having a huge problem here.

&gt; No need, just use anacron.  It works with APM, and it will work with

Well, I'd like to have the machine wake up for jobs that run at night.
That's what I need to change cron for.

&gt; This should talk to my proposed acpictl intermediary program.

Do you intend to keep that program running or start it on-demand. If the
former, it's basically the same as acpipold. :-)

&gt; &gt; - libXacpi

&gt; No need.

It would be cool if you could communicate some things between server and
client, for example hacking something into xsm would require some sort of
extension to the X server so the event can be sent to the client. But I'll
see first how far I will get without that.

Easy.  Of the users allowed to set policy, the last one wins.

If you are the administrator, you set whether or not remote users are
allowed to set policy.

I suggest that rather than overload the nice value with this new meaning,
simply being able to specify a regular expression matched against the
contents of /proc/pid/cmdline to determine which processes are ignored
for the purposes of making decisions about sleeping and explicit CPU
throttling.

No, that's not the right thing to do.

Session management, even when implemented in full, is not a suspend/resume

Furthermore, there is not just one xsm.  I know for certain that GNOME
has its own session manager, and I think that KDE does as well.

&gt;sleeping if the modem was active.

I think that making these plugins is a bit overengineered...  Let's just
put this functionality in the daemon, and use a reasonable interface so
that we can move to plugins if it turns out to be a good idea.

&gt;&gt; &gt; - Some cron jobs
&gt;&gt; &gt;    Cron should be ACPI aware, or we're having a huge problem here.

&gt;
&gt;Well, I'd like to have the machine wake up for jobs that run at night.
&gt;That's what I need to change cron for.

Um, how do you intend to tell the difference between jobs that really
should be run at night and jobs that are run regularly (say, every
few minutes) but should not cause the machine to be woken up?  I'll
bet that you can't come up with a heuristic that I can't come up with
a counterexample for.

Just have anacron run jobs that were missed (that's its job) and make
it possible to ask the daemon to wake up at specified times -- people
who *really* want their machine to wake up in the middle of the night
to do things can add that configuration separately, and then cron or
anacron (whichever is appropriate in the circumstances) will just
automatically do what they wanted.

&gt;[evil accept() hack]
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The accept() hack won't work.  Slowing down incoming identd() requests
&gt;&gt; will just keep the connection table full of established outgoing
&gt;&gt; connections.
&gt;
&gt;Refusing the connections right away should work IMO.

User starts outgoing connection.
All Incoming connections turned off.
Machine on other ends waits for ident to succeed.
User's outgoing connection waits for machine which is waiting for ident,
which doesn't succeed...

I think this is overengineered, anyway.  Trying to drain the connection
table is something we shouldn't try, at least in the first instance.
Let's concentrate on doing things right when there are no connections,
for a start, and then move on from there.

&gt;&gt; &gt; - libacpi
&gt;
&gt;&gt; This should talk to my proposed acpictl intermediary program.
&gt;
&gt;Do you intend to keep that program running or start it on-demand. If the
&gt;former, it's basically the same as acpipold. :-)

On demand.  And each invocation talks to only one program.  Architecture
is like this:

app1[user1] &lt;--&gt; acpictl -i &lt;-+-&gt; acpid [&lt;--&gt; kernel]
app2[user1] &lt;--&gt; acpictl -i &lt;-----^
app3[user2] &lt;--&gt; acpictl -i &lt;-----^
app4[user3] &lt;--&gt; acpictl -i &lt;-----^
              ^                 ^
              This is a pipe    |
                                This is the acpid unix domain socket


acpictl is setgid foo.  Only group foo (and root, of course) is allowed
to open the acpid socket.  Any application can talk to acpictl.  acpictl
sanitizes the requests, *avoiding the potential for buffer overruns in
acpid*.  acpictl is small and therefore easier to write securely and to
audit for security.  It also has limited privileges and thus even if
there is a hole in it, there is less that an attacker can do with it than
with a hole in a setuid program.  Of course, acpid also tries to make sure
that its input is sane (someone could have broken acpictl even if we have
audited it).  Because the protocols are somewhat different, it makes it
hard to come up with an attack that will get through both layers and
attack acpid directly.

&gt;&gt; &gt; - libXacpi
&gt;
&gt;&gt; No need.
&gt;
&gt;It would be cool if you could communicate some things between server and
&gt;client, for example hacking something into xsm would require some sort of
&gt;extension to the X server so the event can be sent to the client. But I'll
&gt;see first how far I will get without that.

Give up on the session management.  It's just not up to the task that you
want to give it.  It's BARELY up to the task of saving your desktop layout,
as we discovered when working on GNOME session management.


You'll notice that I overused one word in this response: "overengineered".
Your note said that you needed 5 people to do all the implementations.
Remember that programmer time is not fungible.  You appear to be trying
to jump into second system effect without even doing the first system...
Let's get something relatively simple, that we actually can implement,
working first, and working well.  If we succeed at that, we may attract
people who want to do more work, and then it will be time to reevaluate.

The daemon helps to save state between requests and can also respond to

And, as I said, Just don't do it.  I'm strongly convinced, based on
our experience in GNOME, that X session management is not up to the
task.  At all.  There is no way to make it fit the bill.

X session management should only be done at explicit user request.
Just because the word "save" is in "SaveYourself" does not mean
that the word "save" really should have been used...

Furthermore, users do not necessarily want that particular state
saved.  It could just blow away their carefully saved state.

No, you have a larger domain that needs to be audited, because you have

only one of which is data sanitization.  I strongly disagree with this
approach.  You also don't seem to understand the difference between data

There's no reason to take it out of acpid on Linux.  acpictl can abstract
that.  On other OS's you can have another architecture under that.

&gt;A pipe as the official API has certain limitations when you need to extend
&gt;the API. I don't want to end up with ExtOp requests... :-)

There's a history on the net of extensible text protocols.  It's no
secret how to do it.

Look at how often kmemps used to have to be rewritten, and compare
that to procps, which can be stable across many different kernel
versions.  Text protocols have much better long-term stability
than binary protocols.

Please explain your "certain limitations".

&gt;&gt; Because the protocols are somewhat different, it makes it hard to come
&gt;&gt; up with an attack that will get through both layers and attack acpid
&gt;&gt; directly.
&gt;

No, because acpipold does more stuff.  It's a bigger domain to audit.

Well, I'd like to have that functionality split out into a separate
daemon. Policy management isn't a kernel issue IMHO, it shouldn't be
handled by a daemon that is part of the kernel (I consider it part of the
kernel because certain functionality depends on it). Splitting it out
would reduce acpid's complexity and size (-&gt; embedded systems).

&gt; No, you have a larger domain that needs to be audited, because you have
&gt; an entire daemon, shared between users, that performs several functions,
&gt; only one of which is data sanitization.

server.c does exactly what you want to do in acpictl. It checks an
incoming packet, then rewrites it to the internal protocol and appends it
to a queue to be processed by another function. It may run in a separate
thread or process, however I don't really see that is really necessary.

&gt; I strongly disagree with this
&gt; approach.  You also don't seem to understand the difference between data

Nope. The data from SO_PASSCRED is added as (trusted) authentication data
to the internal packet. The internal packet however is only built if the
data makes sense.

For the binary vs. text stuff: I can see your point. I'll try to switch
server.c (and libacpi) over to it, since only one request (sleep) has been
implemented yet, this shouldn't be too difficult. I still expect code to
grow significantly, though.

&gt;would reduce acpid's complexity and size (-&gt; embedded systems).

Um, calling acpid part of the kernel because some functionality
is like calling init part of the kernel because the kernel.  Highly
sophistical, and highly suspect.

&gt;&gt; No, you have a larger domain that needs to be audited, because you have
&gt;&gt; an entire daemon, shared between users, that performs several functions,
&gt;&gt; only one of which is data sanitization.
&gt;
&gt;server.c does exactly what you want to do in acpictl. It checks an
&gt;incoming packet, then rewrites it to the internal protocol and appends it
&gt;to a queue to be processed by another function. It may run in a separate
&gt;thread or process, however I don't really see that is really necessary.

A different *address space* is what I have in mind, and yes, it does
make a difference.  If there is an overrun in the first stage of parsing,
then if they are both in the same address space, that overrun could be
used to hit anything.  If they are in a different address space, then
such an overrun can only have an effect if it can be used to take advantage
of a completely different overrun (or other breach) in the process that
is running in a separate address space.

&gt;Nope. The data from SO_PASSCRED is added as (trusted) authentication data
&gt;to the internal packet. The internal packet however is only built if the
&gt;data makes sense.

OK, you know the difference, you just weren't expressing it...  :-)

I still suggest using that data as trusted authentication information to
pass to PAM and let the policy decisions about which users are allowed
to set power management policy (boy, that's confusing!) be done in a
way that is standard across services.

&gt;For the binary vs. text stuff: I can see your point. I'll try to switch
&gt;server.c (and libacpi) over to it, since only one request (sleep) has been
&gt;implemented yet, this shouldn't be too difficult. I still expect code to
&gt;grow significantly, though.

Can I please request that you post a formal definition of that text
protocol here before you set it in stone?  If you don't want your
protocol to limit you in the future, peer review is the only way to
avoid that.

No, actually BmInitialize should be called first

This architecture is very plug-n-play-like.

(Andy, if you want more than that, you have
my entire EC0 definition in an earlier email
from when we were talking about the suspend
key handling on my machine, which is done by
EC0.  This explains, in part, my interest in
getting ECs working...)

I looked at the trace, and it looks like it's
trying to get at EC space before calling
EcInitialize (that is, "EcInitialize" wasn't
in the trace at all and it was complaining
about unknown space 3); I'm really not clear
why that is happening, as I had to leave just
after I figured that out.  Back to work now,
I guess...

Here's a snippet from the trace where I see
the complaint:

...
acpid: AmlReadFieldData: OpRegion EmbeddedControl at 0000003e width 8
acpid: evregion-0278: 
acpid:  19 Entered Function: EvAddressSpaceDispatch
acpid: evregion-0288: 
acpid: Dispatch address access region 0x80F3AC8, no handler
acpid: evregion-0289: 
acpid:  19 Exiting Function: EvAddressSpaceDispatch, AE_EXIST
acpid:  iefread-0116: 
acpid: AmlReadFieldData: **** Unknown OpRegion SpaceID 3
acpid: OsdBreakpoint: Fatal error encountered

Because I see in acpica/control/ec/ec.c:EcInitialize()
the line
    FUNCTION_TRACE("EcInitialize");
I expected to be able to search for EcInitialize in the
trace output, but
[johnsonm@bastable acpid]$ grep EcInit acpitrace.ec
[johnsonm@bastable acpid]$ 

Does that support my analysis?

&gt;Right, EC support is currently limited to
&gt;I/O and there is no support for memory mapped.
&gt;AFAIK, I/O-based ECs are the only ones out
&gt;there and probably the only ones likely to
&gt;appear.

Even if ACPI 2.0 supports, say, PowerPC devices
with no I/O space at all?

&gt;A memory mapped interface would be too costly
&gt;for an EC.

Why?  How could memory mapping be more costly
than I/O mapping?

&gt;And even if someone did implement a
&gt;mem-mapped EC, they would be foolish to use the
&gt;standard EC protocol to access it.

Why?

If they wanted to use existing hardware on a
non-intel machine, wouldn't memory-mapped
access be the cheapest and easiest way to do
it?

Oh, I guess I should quit wondering about things
that will never happen (ACPI on a non-intel
platform) and get back to work...

Hmm..  I wonder if that is bounce?  (physical,

  cat /proc/sys/acpi/event

If you get back multiple lines, that could
very well be bounce and we'll have to see
about fixing that in software.  If you
don't see "0x1" (occurred during S1) that
would also be a problem.

&gt; Second.

&gt; After the acpid has started I get only ~1 KB/sec

&gt; without starting acpid,
&gt; again.

Strange.  Unlikely, but it could be possible that
C-states are interfering with PPP processing
Ie. your system really isn't idle, it is waiting
for PPP data, and the latency involved in going
in and out of C2 or C3 is messing up PPP timeouts.

You could try disabling C-states and see if your
bandwidth improves.  Add "acpi=no-c2,no-c3" to
your kernel command line and let us know what
you see.

Well, the untrusted domain is everything an ordinary user can fully 
control. Whether this is argv[] or the contents of a network packet
doesn't really matter (Although I think the network packet can be checked
more easily).

&gt; Read the proposal I'm writing in a separate letter.  Basically, any
&gt; application that is allowed to set policy can modify the configuration
&gt; in response to events, which gives the potential for programmatic
&gt; policy configuration without imposing it on the vast majority who
&gt; simply do not want it.

This would mean the user would need another daemon that runs scripts based
on ACPI events?

[ssh1 vs. ssh2]

&gt; I've only got ssh1 available on this computer right now.

ssh2 is known not to be fully 8 bit clean, so you're probably better off
with ssh1 anyway. I'm just leaving ssh2 open for those who are frightened
by the buffer overruns in RSAREF.

So do I take that to mean:

Meaning: 18 bit DAC resolution, 18 bit ADC resolution, SigmaTel
3D enhancement (if I'm reading my bits right).  If so, then we
do have different versions of the AC97.  v: seems to be vendor
words.  Does this suggest a different foundry as well?

Huh, the only thing that really gets turned on
when acpid starts is C-states (the processor
powers down while the system is idle)  Try
turning those off and see if the problem goes
away.  Append "acpi=no-c2,no-c3" to the kernel
command line.

Otherwise, Zach, you are adding D-state support

&gt; As per the subject.
&gt; 
&gt; When acpid is not running, everything is fine.
&gt; 
&gt; When acpid is running, the system is sluggish if no

&gt; 
&gt; The maestro docs (linux/Documentation/sound/Maestro)

&gt;

&gt; Otherwise, Zach, you are adding D-state support
&gt; to the Maestro, right? (cool, by the way)  Have
&gt; you seen this?

I haven't, no, but I haven't gotten much feedback on the apm code
in general :)  

The Maestro power management stuff in the existing driver is pretty
danged minimal.  It was only added because when win&lt;something&gt; shutdown
it left the maestro shutdown and a soft reboot to linux meant your
maestro didn't work anymore.

The maestro chip has config registers to say what parts
of the chip should have their clocks fed.  When we don't have any
devices open, we drop the clock to almost all the units.  I don't
honestly know if this reduces the load the chip draws at all, but it
probably should :)  More importantly, paying attention to power
management stuff made the maestro come to life after win had suspended
it :)

I'm not sure exactly what the problem could be.  It sounds like
the chip is making the world very unhappy when its suspended, I would
guess this is 'cause its causing small mountains of spurious ints on the
bus or is doing Evil Things while messing up legacy bus snooping.  I'm
not at all sure why the hell it would do either of these things :)  My
first experiment would be to mess around with the set of units that have
their clocks disabled.  

Also interesting is the fact that the current PM code does absolutely
nothing with the AC97.  Dell may have wired things so that powering down
things without paying attention to the ac97 does bad stuff.  I dunno.

So, 'got me', but I'll work with someone whose interested in playing
with it :)   I don't have maestro hardware at the moment, let alone
maestro hardware that I could play with power management on..

OK, here's my first shot at actually defining a structure for real
items of policy.  This is a static policy, so it doesn't say things
like "if battery then this policy, else that policy".  That is a
separate issue.

Priority: Performance|Battery|Quiet

	This setting is an overall setting; this is used to adjust
	settings when other policies are not set or do not apply.
	This is the only setting that cannot be "None".

All the rest of the policies default to "None", meaning that there
is no setting, fall back to Priority.

SuspendPolicy: Ram|Disk

	When an external suspend event arrives (i.e. the user has
	closed the lid, pressed a suspend key, whatever) determines
	whether the user prefers a quick suspend to ram (S3) or a
	slower suspend to disk (S4).  This is ignored when we have
	a way of telling which kind of suspend the user requested,
	such as on machines with separate suspend-to-ram and
	suspend-to-disk keys/buttons.

Sleep: Lightly|Deeply (Or perhaps a percentage scale or something)

	Weights how readily the system transitions to S2 instead
	of S1.  Think of it as a system-wide nice level.

MaxCPUSpeed: percentage

	Gives a suggested maximum percentage CPU speed.  This will,
	of course, be subject to what speed stepping levels exist
	on the machine.  A value of None will cause this to be
	dynamically set based on Priority.

	Note: the ACPI standard appears to consider CPU throttling
	only as a thermal management procedure, without considering
	the effects on battery life management.

This is, of course, only a start.  What other static policy states
do we need?


Please understand that the final language we define could well
have multiple policy definitions and events, like:
default {
	Priority Noise
	MaxCPUSpeed None
	Sleep None
}
event mains {
	Priority Performance
	MaxCPUSpeed None
	Sleep None
}
event battery {
	Priority Battery
	MaxCPUSpeed 50
	Sleep lightly
}
event battery_low {
	Priority Battery
	Sleep deeply
	Fans quiet
	SuspendPolicy Disk
}
Obviously those event names are bad and the structure sucks, but
my point is that restricting our current work to the definition of
a static policy does not imply that we can't react to events.  It's
just a way of limiting the scope of our work so that we do not
confuse ourselves at this stage.

This policy is also not inclusive of necessary actions.  For
example, the fact that PPP connections will not survive a
suspend action is not included here.  Event actions are a
completely different topic, and there are many of them that
we will have to define.

I'm open to other completely different definitions of static
policy -- just try to make them relatively formal so that we can
discuss them intelligently.

Just a FYI that I'm doing rather heavy
modification of acpid/ipc.{c,h} and of
the entire acpictl directory.  I'm not
making heavy protocol changes, but I'm
changing several things at once, in an
interconnected way.

I'm also mucking lightly with bm.c

and probably lightly with other parts

This is a multipart MIME message.


I've added a protocol versioning system to
acpid's socket protocol.  As soon as we have
two binaries (acpid and acpictl) floating
around that share a protocol, it becomes obvious
that someday someone will have two different
versions on his system, built from different
sources, and this will wreak havoc.  Even though
they are built from the same sources, and thus
should change together, imagine the following
scenario as only one instance of what could go
wrong.

Joe User tries out acpi.  He first does a
./configure --prefix /usr/local
while trying things out, and then later does
./configure --prefix /usr
with a newer once he is satisfied that he likes
ACPI.  In the meantime, of course, the protocol
numbers have changed.  Joe has /usr/local/bin
first in his path because he has some nifty
programs there that intentionally override
versions in /usr/bin and /bin for him without
mangling system scripts that rely on the
stodgy normal versions.  So, of course, when
he runs acpictl, he runs the old version in
/usr/local/bin/acpictl and it tries to talk
to the new daemon, which of course was started
as /usr/sbin/acpid from the new
/etc/rc.d/init.d/acpi script that the new
version of acpid installed.  The output is
mangled in strange ways, and we get a really
wierd-looking bug report here.  We spend a
few hours looking through his bug report before
someone thinks about old versions of acpictl...

We'll avoid that entirely by adding the protocol number
to the protocol before making acpictl an installed
program (right now, Makefile.am sets acpictl to
be built but not installed).


While I was at it, I rearranged the protocol a bit;
I made the enumeration a bit more sane by using a
hierarchical naming scheme, and by using an enumeration
for the otherwise not-explicitly-defined status value.

I also made acpictl only query batteries that it
discovers to exist, made acpictl depend on popt,
moved to *nprintf within acpictl and ipc.{c,h} and
did various other things that I'm forgetting at the
moment...

Note that after applying this patch, you will have to
run ./autogen.sh because I modified acpictl/Makefile.am


 *** Andy, please tell me whether or not you apply this;
     if you do apply it, and if it touches other code
     that you have been working on, please make another
     code drop so that we can stay in sync.  Thanks!
     If you don't apply it, let me know what you want
     changed.

Oh, and I haven't tested this, except to make sure that
it compiles.  :-/  Sometimes I wish I was back in the
office with separate test and development machines...
On the other hand, untested patches work for Linus, so
maybe this will work for me!  :-)

Well, I still haven't tested it, but I have rectified
the worst ugliness, and it still compiles.

Andy, this should be applied over my last patch.  It
should be functionally identical, but is easier to read
and modify.

A new version of acpid is available now from

 
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/

Changes
* Added Michael Johnson's latest patches
  (note that the popt library is now required
  to build acpictl)
* Added information about creating bug reports
  (see REPORTING-BUGS)
* Added an option (-t) to acpid to produce a (rather
  sizeable) debug trace which should help us
  track down, at the very least, crashes
  (see REPORTING-BUGS)
* A nifty AML debugger is turned on by default
  now when using -d.  Try "help".  Additional
  documentation will be available soon.

Untested patches don't work so well for me; there was a
0 that should have been a -1.  Here's a patch that fixes
that and also improves some formatting.

The other improvements look very spiffy.  I had fun
crashing acpid in the debugger, running random control
methods, etc.  :-)

I eventually got acpid powering off with the BP6.  The new debugging
features allowed me to come up the the attached patch, which makes it
work.

It looks like a combination of a libc bug (strncmp was failing for some
reason, so I got the error 'Unknown table 'FACP' followed by the error
'Cannot find FACP'!) and an ABIT bug (In S4 and S5 a type is set to zero
instead of the required object type).  Also I had a compliation error
which I patched in the best way I knew how, given that I don't know any
GAS assembler...

Now when I start up in debug mode I get a couple of screens full of
warnings about AE_NULL_OBJECT then it settles down and tells me that
s0,s1,s4 and s5 are available, which is good enough for me. (debug
output attached).

&gt;&gt; No, you missed my point.  My point is that the whole untrusted information

&gt;
&gt;Well, the untrusted domain is everything an ordinary user can fully 
&gt;control. Whether this is argv[] or the contents of a network packet
&gt;doesn't really matter (Although I think the network packet can be checked
&gt;more easily).

My point is that the process of translation by trusted code will have
the tendency to make buffer overflows harder to find.

In general, binary protocols have seemed to be bad from a security
standpoint because they seem more susceptible to code rot -- it was
secure when first written, but when new contributors come, they just
don't recognize the implications of some new combination they just
created, and, whoops, that integer index that used to be a short
now indexes some important piece of memory and it's not checked and
welcome to root, Mr. Cracker!  :-/

I'm of the opinion that the discipline of transforming a textual
protocol into a binary protocol makes some of these interactions
more obvious and makes it harder to, say, make a buffer overflow
at the hidden level if there is a level of error-checking in
between in which there is an attempt made to sanitize the data.

The vast majority of programmers, even really hot-shot programmers,
honestly don't have the first clue how to write secure programs.  I
am myself only moderately good at analyzing my own programs for
security, better than average but important stuff I ask people better
than me to audit.  I don't trust Joe Random Contributor to get this
right...

&gt;&gt; Read the proposal I'm writing in a separate letter.  Basically, any
&gt;&gt; application that is allowed to set policy can modify the configuration
&gt;&gt; in response to events, which gives the potential for programmatic
&gt;&gt; policy configuration without imposing it on the vast majority who
&gt;&gt; simply do not want it.
&gt;
&gt;This would mean the user would need another daemon that runs scripts based
&gt;on ACPI events?

Respond to that letter separately -- I've realized that acpid needs to
be able to respond to events, but I still don't want it to be done
procedurally.  That configuration language should be an event-&gt;action
mapping, not a turing-equvalent (or even turing-similar...) language.

My point is that people who want to control policy with a turing-equiv
language can do so by writing an application which talks through
acpictl to acpid, subscribes to events, and changes policy in response
to them.

The other half of that point is that almost no users will want to do
this, but my architecture makes that complexity available to them
without imposing it on normal users who would only be confused by it.
I'm trying to think of this configuration in part from the perspective
of writing a graphical configuration tool that modifies it.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI quirk for ACPI devices

Hi all,

this is updated PCI quirk for ACPI devices.
Changes from previous post:
        - fixup type changed PCI_FIXUP_FINAL -&gt; PCI_FIXUP_HEADER;
        - added IRQ setting for Intel and VIA devices;
        - minor cleanup in chipset support code of /linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c.

Also one question:
        why dev-&gt;irq != dev-&gt;irq_resource[0].start in pci_dev structure ?
        IMHO it cause some ugly lines of code in drivers supporting both PCI
        and ISA PnP devices (look at /linux/drivers/char/serial.c for example).

Best wishes,
                Andrey

Subject: Re: [PATCH] PCI quirk for ACPI devices

Hello!

&gt; this is updated PCI quirk for ACPI devices.
&gt; Changes from previous post:
&gt;         - fixup type changed PCI_FIXUP_FINAL -&gt; PCI_FIXUP_HEADER;
&gt;         - added IRQ setting for Intel and VIA devices;

   I'm not sure at all how does ACPI IRQ routing work on machines other than
PC's or even on SMP PC's. Doing things like `dev-&gt;irq = 9' in platform independent
code smells of problems.

   You should either decide ACPI is not used outside the PC world and move the
quirks to arch/i386/pci-pc.c or do the IRQ fixups in the ACPI driver which is
i386 specific as well.

&gt; Also one question:
&gt;         why dev-&gt;irq != dev-&gt;irq_resource[0].start in pci_dev structure ?
&gt;         IMHO it cause some ugly lines of code in drivers supporting both PCI
&gt;         and ISA PnP devices (look at /linux/drivers/char/serial.c for example).

   It's basically because I wanted to avoid keeping track of two IRQ number
variables in the core code and the simplification of such combo drivers is
too small to outweigh the core changes.

				Have a nice fortnight

&gt; &gt; the poweron button to
&gt; &gt; wake it up again. Now it goes directly to poweroff?
&gt; &gt; :-(
&gt;
&gt; Hmm..  I wonder if that is bounce?  (physical,
&gt; electrical, etc.)  You can test this by
&gt; rebooting without acpid, then
&gt;
&gt;   # turn the power button event on
&gt;   echo 0x100 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/pm1_enable
&gt;   # wait for the power button event
&gt;   cat /proc/sys/acpi/event
&gt;   # in another window or console, initiate sleep
&gt;   echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/sleep
&gt;
&gt; Now, what do you get back from the "cat" ?
&gt; You should see a single line
&gt;
&gt;   0x00000100 0x00000000 0x1
&gt;          ^                ^
&gt;          power button     occured while in S1
&gt;
&gt; If you get back multiple lines, that could
&gt; very well be bounce and we'll have to see
&gt; about fixing that in software.  If you
&gt; don't see "0x1" (occurred during S1) that
&gt; would also be a problem.

SunWave1&gt;echo 0x100 &gt;/proc/sys/acpi/pm1_enable

SunWave1&gt;cat /proc/sys/acpi/event
0x00000100 0x00000000 0x0
0x00000100 0x00000000 0x0
0x00000100 0x00000000 0x0
0x00000100 0x00000000 0x0
0x00000100 0x00000000 0x0

I get only one line per power button press (I pressed it 5 times ---
right, I guess).
But 0x0 is wrong?

&gt; &gt; Second.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After the acpid has started I get only ~1 KB/sec
&gt; &gt; with pppd. My ppp
&gt; &gt; connections are so slow that I can't use them
&gt; &gt; together with acpid
&gt; &gt; running. To solve the situation I have to reboot
&gt; &gt; without starting acpid,
&gt; &gt; again.
&gt;
&gt; Strange.  Unlikely, but it could be possible that
&gt; C-states are interfering with PPP processing
&gt; Ie. your system really isn't idle, it is waiting
&gt; for PPP data, and the latency involved in going
&gt; in and out of C2 or C3 is messing up PPP timeouts.

You are right. See above.

&gt; You could try disabling C-states and see if your
&gt; bandwidth improves.  Add "acpi=no-c2,no-c3" to
&gt; your kernel command line and let us know what
&gt; you see.

Andy,

you are the man!

SunWave1&gt;cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=linux ro root=803 reboot=warm acpi=no-c2,no-c3
SunWave1&gt;cat /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ

SunWave1&gt;ps aux | grep acpid

ppp is back to normal :-)

Correct.

E820 support in the Linux kernel was originally done without ACPI in mind
at all -- it was just the most reliable way to detect large amounts of
memory in a machine.  It is also required on machines with memory holes
to boot reliably -- what if the kernel was copied into, or partially
into, a hole?  Oops!

&gt;Also, what kind of
&gt;"memory holes" are we talking about?  I've only seen reference to the
&gt;640k-1MB hole, are there other holes?

There can be arbitrary holes, at the hardware vendor's discretion.

&gt;I only need to learn about the memory layout, not ACPI as a whole, which is
&gt;why I little reluctant to spend days pouring over the source code and ACPI
&gt;spec.  I'd appreciate anyone's indulgence in this matter.

Then don't bother with the ACPI "specification".  I don't know where to
get the original spec for the E820 extension, but I'm pretty sure that
it's not the ACPI spec.  Have you searched Intel's developer web site?
Read Ralph Brown's interrupt list?  E820 is really only tangentially
related to ACPI in that it helps us find the ACPI tables.  Beyond
that, ACPI really doesn't care about it.

Hmm.. I wonder if the problem is this bad checksum?

&gt; (Andy, if you want more than that, you have

&gt; from when we were talking about the suspend
&gt; key handling on my machine, which is done by
&gt; EC0.  This explains, in part, my interest in
&gt; getting ECs working...)

OK, the current EC driver is really only to do
battery and thermal.  It will need to be grown
to support button handling.  In any case, I
will take a closer look and see what the source
of your problem is.

&gt; Here's a snippet from the trace where I see
&gt; the complaint:
&gt; 
&gt; ....
&gt; acpid: AmlReadFieldData: OpRegion EmbeddedControl at
&gt; 0000003e width 8
&gt; acpid: evregion-0278: 
&gt; acpid:  19 Entered Function: EvAddressSpaceDispatch
&gt; acpid: evregion-0288: 
&gt; acpid: Dispatch address access region 0x80F3AC8, no
&gt; handler
&gt; acpid: evregion-0289: 
&gt; acpid:  19 Exiting Function: EvAddressSpaceDispatch,
&gt; AE_EXIST
&gt; acpid:  iefread-0116: 
&gt; acpid: AmlReadFieldData: **** Unknown OpRegion
&gt; SpaceID 3
&gt; acpid: OsdBreakpoint: Fatal error encountered

The problem is EcInit failed so it doesn't get a
chance to register an address space handler for
OpRegions of type 3 (embedded-controller).  When the
interpreter attempts to access an EC OpRegion,
it fails.

&gt; Because I see in
&gt; acpica/control/ec/ec.c:EcInitialize()
&gt; the line
&gt;     FUNCTION_TRACE("EcInitialize");
&gt; I expected to be able to search for EcInitialize in
&gt; the
&gt; trace output, but
&gt; [johnsonm@bastable acpid]$ grep EcInit acpitrace.ec
&gt; [johnsonm@bastable acpid]$ 
&gt; 
&gt; Does that support my analysis?

Hmm...  EcInit should be called from acpid/bm.c
Remember to turn on full debug output (acpid -dt)

&gt; Even if ACPI 2.0 supports, say, PowerPC devices
&gt; with no I/O space at all?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;A memory mapped interface would be too costly
&gt; &gt;for an EC.
&gt; 
&gt; Why?  How could memory mapping be more costly
&gt; than I/O mapping?

I'm definitely no hardware guy but I do know
that DMA, bus mastering, etc. cost you.  Check
out the divergence between USB OHCI and UHCI
to see an example of favoring I/O, presumably
for cost.

&gt; &gt;And even if someone did implement a
&gt; &gt;mem-mapped EC, they would be foolish to use the
&gt; &gt;standard EC protocol to access it.
&gt; 
&gt; Why?

The EC protocol is a mess.  It requires polling
and well-known delays in order to work.  There
is a way to make the EC interrupt (GPE) driven,
but it was all but unworkable on my test systems.

&gt; If they wanted to use existing hardware on a
&gt; non-intel machine, wouldn't memory-mapped
&gt; access be the cheapest and easiest way to do
&gt; it?

ACPI support necessitates changes down to the
processor and chipset level.  The EC is a
small issue comparatively.  Another architecture
could easily roll their own interface to batteries,
thermal, etc. and expose it through AML.

Andy Henroid writes:
&gt;Hmm.. I wonder if the problem is this bad checksum?

Not unless they added checksum calculation in this
last version of acpica; remember I looked for it in
the first place and you said that correctly-calculated
checksums were nearly unheard-of, which was why there
was no resource descriptor checksum calculation in
acpica.

[johnsonm@bastable acpid]$ grep -i checksum acpitrace.ec
acpid:  03 Entered Function: TbVerifyTableChecksum
acpid:  03 Exiting Function: TbVerifyTableChecksum, AE_OK
acpid:  03 Entered Function: TbVerifyTableChecksum
acpid:  03 Exiting Function: TbVerifyTableChecksum, AE_OK

Certainly none noted in the trace...

Frankly, I'm not surprised, on reflection, that checksums
on resource descriptors aren't often there -- when, as
often happens, a template resource descriptor buffer has
details filled in with AML code, it seems a waste of space
to write AML code to carefully construct a checksum value
that is then checked in the calling code...

&gt;OK, the current EC driver is really only to do
&gt;battery and thermal.  It will need to be grown
&gt;to support button handling.  In any case, I
&gt;will take a closer look and see what the source
&gt;of your problem is.

But I haven't tried to add any button handling
yet, for the moment just using the EC driver to
do anything would be a start.

&gt;The problem is EcInit failed so it doesn't get a
&gt;chance to register an address space handler for
&gt;OpRegions of type 3 (embedded-controller).  When the
&gt;interpreter attempts to access an EC OpRegion,
&gt;it fails.

Would you like me to send you the entire trace from
acpid without my modifications to bm.c, just the #if 0
changed to #if 1?

&gt;Hmm...  EcInit should be called from acpid/bm.c
&gt;Remember to turn on full debug output (acpid -dt)

I did!

Remember, with an unaltered acpid, we never got to
EcInitialize because of the failure in BmInitialize.
We never returned from BmInitialize; it halted after
the error that I quoted before:
acpid: AmlReadFieldData: **** Unknown OpRegion SpaceID 3
The fact that it failed when trying to access the
EC from within BmInitialize was what made me think
that it wanted EcInitialize called first.  (Silly me...)

&gt;No, actually BmInitialize should be called first
&gt;followed by EcInitialize, BtInitialize (battery),
&gt;TzInitialize (thermal).  Each of the components
&gt;(EC, battery, thermal) then register with the
&gt;bus manager (Bm) and AddDevice is called for each
&gt;instance of battery, EC, or thermal zone found.
&gt;
&gt;This architecture is very plug-n-play-like.

Well, I understand now that that is what is intended,
but the fact that BmInitialize is failing because
the handler for OpRegion SpaceID 3 has not yet been
registered leads me to think that the architecture
is a little convoluted.  :-)


Thanks for the explanation about why you think that
the EC will only ever be accessed via I/O space.

I tried on two different machines with identical results.
My system is Debian 2.2 (frozen) aka potato with glibc2.1. Compiler is

There seems to be a bug in apicd causing it not to parse S states with
0x0 0x0 as their value. A patch was posted a while back but as far as I
know Andy has not merged/checked it.

Andy - for your information acpid -d on my Abit BH6 gives the following

I assume that the errors in the setup stage are caused by the parsing
problem in acpid, while the other program to parse acpid namespcae gives
the correct values of 0x0 for S4 and S5. (acpidmp DSDT | acpianalyze)

For acpid and pmtools, the phobos CVS tree is only provided as an upgrade
convenience, the version on Andy's site is the definitive. CVS just makes
creating patches easier here. For acpipolicy, CVS is the current version.

I usually update the CVS tree after a couple of hours, should be done when
the binaries have shown up on the download page on phobos and there are no
more locks in the repository. :-)

You can subscribe to acpi-cvs if you want to be notified of checkins (I
haven't added this to the main page because the list tends to cause a high
system load (60-80) when huge changes are committed (it's still a 486...).

I suspect the right behaviour is to have something like

	/*
	 * Sleep sequence for ACPI/APM/whatever
	 */
	pm_callback(PM_SLEEP);
	cli();
	/* real sleep here */
	pm_callback(PM_WAKEUP);
	sti();

so that we have all interrupts disabled until _all_ devices have been
re-initialized again. Otherwise we get tons of strange ordering things.

The reason I don't like disable/enable_irq here is that if each device
driver does a "disable_irq()"/"enable_irq()", then you cannot know in
your sleep routines whether interrupts are enabled or not.  Imagine that
you have a disk controller and a mouse sharing the same irq.  Depending
on which order they happen to have in the PM callback list, either of
the two will run with interrupts disabled before it goes to sleep, and
they won't be enabled until both have woken up. So wakeup behaviour is
repeatable, but the behaviour on sleep is dependent on random factors.

Imagine that the harddisk needs its interrupts in order to go to sleep
nicely (for example, doing a internal "sync everything" and needing the
interrupt to tell when it's all done).  And imagine that the mouse
disabled the irq before we even get to the harddisk driver sleep
function..  BAD.

With my suggested "global" irq setup above, you at least have totally
repeatable behaviour.  It will work the same whether there are shared
interrupts or not.  Which will make it less likely that we'll have
problems that only happen on certain machines - the nasty kind to
debug.. We may have other problems (it requires that all devices can be
re-initialized without interrupts, but that should be fine), but at
least they'll be more repeatable.

everything go all right.
There's still a problem... when I launch acpid it say that:

acpid: started
acpid: ACPI Subsystem version [May 24 2000]
acpid: FACP loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/
acpid:  tbutils-0240: 
acpid: *** Error: Invalid ACPI table checksum
acpid: nsapinam-0058: 
acpid: DSDT is not in memory
acpid: OsdBreakpoint: Fatal error encountered
acpid: cannot load ACPI namespace

my kernel is 2.3.99-pre8 ( and while booting it 
says "ACPI: found PIIX4 at 0x4000) , 
I have a motherboard EPOX KP6-BS with  dual
Pentium II 400MHz, chipset 440BX 

the contents of /proc/sys/acpi is:

/proc/sys/acpi/dsdt
/proc/sys/acpi/enter_lvl2_lat
/proc/sys/acpi/enter_lvl3_lat
/proc/sys/acpi/event
/proc/sys/acpi/facp

/proc/sys/acpi/s0_slp_typ
/proc/sys/acpi/s1_slp_typ
/proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ
/proc/sys/acpi/sleep

I've already patched my BIOS with the latest release... 
the README included says that there was a problem with ACPI unser SCO
Unix... so I thought to upgrade.
But the problem persists

Have you any idea?
I forgot to set some device/parameter? or simply my BIOS or my motherboard are
broken or unsupported?

Thanks

Luca.

Since last time I post, I had an idea about acpi_enable.
for now, initialization of the acpi is like this :

check acpi_tables,
map tables
map io ports
set acpi irq

my problems is that setting irq without acpi_enable hangs the machine.
I was wondering why have we got to set the irq while acpi is not enabled ?
Could we remove the request_irq call in the acpi_init and move it to the
acpi_enable function.
Then we add another call to leave the irq in the acpi_disable function and
we have irq used only if acpi is enabled
(like the irq with the NIC cards which is used only when the interface is
up).

What do you think about that ?
I'll try tonight and will give you some feedback after.

I reported some time ago problems with the 440MX chipset from Intel.

I did'nt really look hard at this problem.
I had been able to make acpi work by enabling the acpi in the acpi_init
function.
But then, others things got broken (like NIC card).
I though it was IRQ related, but I checked and all IRQs are the same as if I
boot with acpi=off flag.
Now I don't know what could be wrong.
Do you know some way to get debug information from kernel ?
I'm now scratching my head. I think I have to put again some printk to check
where the hangs happens in the NIC card activation.
I'll have to check.

&gt;
&gt; Hmm..  I might be tempted to leave the request_irq
&gt; in acpi_init.  This allows the ACPI driver to detect
&gt; interrupt conflicts when it initializes, rather than
&gt; much later when it goes to turn on ACPI.
&gt;
&gt; If the problem is what I think, this should also
&gt; work
&gt;
&gt;   ...
&gt;   int acpi_enabled = 0;
&gt;   ...
&gt;   static void acpi_irq(...)
&gt;   {
&gt;      if (!acpi_enabled)

&gt;      ...

&gt;   {
&gt;      ...
&gt;      acpi_enabled = 1;
&gt;      ...
&gt;   }

Nope, according to what I saw, the irq_handler is called in an infinite
loop when irq is set and acpi is not enabled.
So this change won't solve anything (the infinite loop is shorter,
that's all).
Is there a way in linux kernel to announce that we need an irq, that we
accept to share it but we do not set the handler yet.
Something like an irq reservation ?? This would helps to solve the
conlict.

&gt; So, I forget, the ACPI interrupt is being shared
&gt; with your ethernet card?  If so, I would expect a
&gt; lot of interrupts to come in from the ethernet
&gt; card.  Perhaps your ACPI implementation doesn't
&gt; like to be polled (to see if ACPI is the source
&gt; of the interrupt) before it is enabled?  If so,
&gt; the above patch should fix.

No. The irq for the NIC is 10. The irq for acpi is 9. They do not
collide.
Moreover, this driver is ACPI aware for the chip builtin my laptop. It's
running correctly when using the APM.
The behaviour is not the same when acpi. Here's an extract :

static void tulip_up(struct net_device *dev)
{
    ...

    /* Wake the chip from sleep/snooze mode. */
    if (tp-&gt;flags &amp; HAS_ACPI)
        pci_write_config_dword(tp-&gt;pdev, 0x40, 0);
    ...
 }
I tried to remove the ACPI awareness to check if there was a
misbehaviour of the ACPI code.
But I got the same behaviour.
I maybe should post this on the regular kernel mailing list.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy

Hi,
	I'm having a problem with acpi support in the 2.4.0-test1
kernel.  I am using the 052200 acpid (although whether the daemon
is running or not doesn't affect this bug), on an ASUS K7V system.

   The problem:  shutdown gets to the point where it prints
"power off" but does not actually power off the machine.  With acpid
running, a press on the power button is correctly detected and the system
shuts down.  However, when it gets to the point where it should
power off the machine, the screen goes black (but the monitor does
not go into suspend mode) and the machine does not turn off.

    I'm sending a full bug report to Andy, but please let me know if
anybody else has a suggestion!

motherboard:  ASUS K7V
chipset:  VIA KX-133
BIOS:  1005a
vendor:  homemade

Thanks,
JMC

I've cleverly worded the subject to avoid assigning blame for the bugs;
I don't know whose fault they are.

Here is what I have seen so far:

 o  Once only, acpid -d blanked the screen and the screeen would not
    come to life again without a complete reboot.  With some random
    key pressing, I managed to do a clean reboot, but didn't know
    that until I saw the fsck show cleanly unmounted filesystems on
    the next boot.  The blanked screen effect wasn't sleeping, because
    pressing the power button did not bring the screen back; normally,
    when I have put the machine to sleep (which I can only do right
    now with the "echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/sleep" trick), pressing
    the power button wakes it up properly.

 o  If I press the power button immediately after starting acpid,
    it does a proper shutdown, but if I suspend first (with the
    echo trick mentioned above) and then bring the machine back to
    life with the power button, acpid reports all further presses
    of the power button but doesn't do anything about it.  I would
    guess this is because it is confused about what state the
    machine is in, but I have not investigated further.

 o  The suspend key, which works without any assistance (from text
    mode, anyway) without acpid running, quits working entirely when
    acpid is running.  I would have assumed that it is the sleep
    button, but I guess not.  What event would you expect the suspend
    key to be?  (In my case, the "suspend key" is Fn+ESC.)  I notice
    that acpid does not report any events when this key is pressed;
    I presume that acpid does not enable handling this event.

 o  Entering sleep does not spin down the hard drive.  I don't know
    where this bug lies; when the BIOS suspends the machine, the hard
    drive spins down, but when I use hdparm to try to tell the hard
    drive to spin down, there is no effect.  (This is true whether I
    set it to spin down after a delay or immediately.)

Any suggestions about how to track these down (or implement the suspend
key handling) would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

Has the ACPI parsing bug been fixed yet?  I notice the CVS tree hasn't
been updated for some time, and I would like to use ACPI on my mobo
(BP6).

Also, I notice that acpi 'power off' doesn't seem to work properly.  I
echo 1 &gt;/proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ, and it
successfully powers off...  for about half an hour, then it powers up
again.  I have switched off all the 'wake up on..'
options in the BIOS.  I'm guessing a BIOS bug rather than an ACPI one,
though.

I've been thinking about what ACPI needs to be able to do to replace
APM for people used to APM under Linux.  As I see it, we need at least:
 o  Lid events
 o  Suspend key(s) handling
 o  Battery status reporting, via
    - CMBatt
    - Smart Battery
Is there anything else missing that people are used to getting with APM
for Linux that ACPI for Linux doesn't yet provide?

Has anyone worked on making the disassembler more useful by interpreting
some of the fields that are currently presented only in numeric format?
For example, it would be easier to read Field's FieldFlags and OpRegion's
RegionSpace if they were spelled out in the output.

I'm not sure how to fit this into the architecture.  I have tried two
different approaches to breaking out FieldFlags and haven't been
successful because I tried to do it quickly without grokking the whole
structure...  :-)

Andy, this is your code; any suggestions on how to do this cleanly?  I
am not sure that it makes sense to create fake ops and args for each
of these types of objects.  Perhaps I need a new construct of some
sort?  If acpi_sprint_op could eat following ops, I could do all the
mangling there -- e.g. if FIELD, then eat the following BYTECONST and
print it my own way.

Well, I knew that confessing that I was missing something would make me
find it...  I was missing a single case statement in ns.c; otherwise my
patch worked perfectly.

Andy, what do you think of the attached patch as a way of dealing with
this?  If you like it, wait to apply it, because I'll give you a more
complete patch with more things implemented later.  If you don't like
it, let me know how you would like it changed and I'll change the other
things to fit whatever pattern you suggest.

&gt;To be a complete replacement for APM, ACPI

But we already have this; I was concentrating on what we don't have.

&gt;  o Suspend to disk (S4)

As nice as that is, and as much as I want it, most laptops do not seem
to have this working reliably under Linux with APM so I count this as
less critical.  It's at least far lower on my priority list than suspend
to RAM.  It's also much harder to get right.

&gt;  o Video blank

Again, my laptop blanks the video.  (Heh, even when it's not supposed
to sometimes, as you saw from my bug report)  What's missing here?

&gt;The kernel-side support for Lid is already
&gt;there.  It's just a matter of looking up which
&gt;GPE correlates to the Lid for your system and
&gt;enabling it.

Yes, I don't really care where the work needs to be done -- I'm just
trying to list the jobs and prioritize them a bit.

&gt;Oh, and to my list let me add battery status,
&gt;of course.

Of course.  It (in both forms) was on the list to which you were
responding.  Unless the list you are referring to is the already
complete list.

BTW, how important is it to implement the SMBus functionality?  If
it is important, it doesn't look too hard; the only thing I'm worried
about is bus enumeration.  The i2c code in the kernel has what looks
like a nice interface that we can use for acpid and which will easily
convert to a kernel interface once the aml interpreter moves into the
kernel.

Way cool!  Re-indented to make patch application difficult!  ;-)

Enclosed please find the latest disassembler enhancement patch,
since I didn't see any objection to the way I did it before.

Andy, accept my apologies: you were right.
The ACPI was not enabled.
I had to add in the acpi code and explicit call to acpi_enable.
What I do not understand is how can it work in the other place. I had a
look at the acpi definitions and at page 177 they
says about turning on ACPI :
'When a platform initialize from a cold boot (mechanical off or from S4
state), the hardware platform is assumed to
be configured in a legacy configuration. From these states, the BIOS
software initializes the computer as it would for a
legacy operating system. When control is passed to the operating system,
the OS will then enable the ACPI mode by first
scanning memory for ACPI tables, and then generates a write of the
ACPI_ENABLE value to the SMI_CMD port
(as described by the FACP table). The hardware platform will set the
SCI_EN bit to indicate to the OS that the hardware platform is now
configured for ACPI.'
So according to this specification:
1) all the machines are supposed to boot into APM modes (which is the
legacy state)
2) it's up to the OS to emit the acpi_enable ( facp ) if the machine is
not in acpi state (as it can be from a s2 or s3 wakeup)

I couldn't find how the acpi_enable register is set at kernel startup.
Am I missing something or the call is missing ?
I have another problem which is more simple.
When powering off my laptop, the machine shutdown correctly, then powers
down itself.
Now, what is not normal, is that just after powering down, it goes up
again.
Have you already met such behaviour ??

If you wand it here's the patch :
-----------------
    if (facp-&gt;p_lvl3_lat
        &amp;&amp; facp-&gt;p_lvl3_lat &lt;= ACPI_MAX_P_LVL3_LAT
        &amp;&amp; !acpi_verify_mod(ACPI_P_LVL3_LAT)) {
        acpi_p_lvl3_lat = ACPI_uS_TO_TMR_TICKS(facp-&gt;p_lvl3_lat);
        acpi_enter_lvl3_lat
            = ACPI_uS_TO_TMR_TICKS(facp-&gt;p_lvl3_lat * 5);
    }

    if (acpi_claim_ioports(facp)) {
        printk(KERN_ERR "ACPI: I/O port allocation failed\n");
        goto err_out;
    }
+
+    if (!acpi_is_enabled(facp))
+        acpi_enable(facp);

    if (facp-&gt;sci_int
        &amp;&amp; acpi_sci_enabled()
        &amp;&amp; request_irq(facp-&gt;sci_int,
               acpi_irq,
               SA_INTERRUPT | SA_SHIRQ,
               "acpi",
               &amp;acpi_facp)) {

I'm pretty sure that I've seen quite a few pieces of code like this,
but I'll refer only to the example I'm looking at now.

In acpidisasm/util.c:acpi_show(), we have:

acpi_show(const struct acpi_op *origin)
{
	...
        const struct acpi_op *op = origin;
        if(op)
        {
		// do stuff with op
		...
	}
	else
	{
		if(acpi_sprint_op(buffer, sizeof(buffer), op) &gt; 0)
                {
                        printf("%s\n", buffer);
                }

	}
}

But if !op, i.e. op == NULL, what do you expect is being printed?
Is this vestigial code, or are my brains falling out?

Here's a patch against the latest pmtools that makes it easier to see
the namespace in acpidisasm output, by printing out the full name of
named objects.

Andy, I'm in some doubt about which parts of this you want to apply.
There are two completely separate parts to this patch.  One adds
the (currently commented-out) capability to just print out a namespace
tree with nothing else in it; the other adds full path information to
named objects in the normal acpidisasm output.  (Except for *Fields in
a Field; those I left out explicitly because acpi_sprint_path reasonably
enough doesn't deal with that case and I wasn't sure that it is worth
changing it to do so; indeed, I'm not sure it is even right to do so.)

With my changes to the normal acpidisasm output, the commented-out
portion can be reproduced by modifying acpidisasm output with awk, sed,
or perl, so I'm not sure how useful that change is.  I left it commented
out in part because it wants a command-line option and I don't know which
command-line option handling package you would want to use; I tend to
use popt because it is one of the only packages that works recursively
but that doesn't mean you agree with me...

So I'd like you to apply the first two chunks of the util.c diff, but
the rest of them are completely at your discretion.  Try uncommenting
the line in disasm.c and see what you think of the output as a quick
reference to the namespace.

In order to make the disassembler output for the _{C,P,S}RS Buffer ByteLists
a bit more readable (see section 6.4), I may need a bit more infrastructure.
It's trivial for me to change to being able to print out more than one line
per object and maintain indentation; I've figured that out.  Would it be
considered kosher for me to change the printing in util.c to look up the
parent of the parent of a bytelist and see if its name is _{C,P,S}RS, and if
so, to interpret the bytelist accordingly?

BTW, if I make the changes to print more than one line per object, I can
make it possible to print all ByteLists in their entirety and leave off
the elipses...

Andy, any opinions about this?

If we find a real undisputable bug in the bios, I expect Dell
will be willing to fix it and issue a flash update, though on
their own time schedule, I expect.

&gt;&gt; Here is what I have seen so far:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  o  Once only, acpid -d blanked the screen and the
&gt;&gt; screeen would not
&gt;&gt;     come to life again without a complete reboot. 
&gt;
&gt;Now that is very odd.  Is this with the experimental
&gt;S1 support turned on?

Yes.

&gt;The code paths for blanking
&gt;the screen from ACPI are not even accessible unless
&gt;you turn that on and even so will not be run unless
&gt;you do an explicit 'echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/sleep'

It has only happened once, so it's clearly not an
intentional code path...  :-)  I'll let you know if
it happens again.

&gt;Could this be related to your APM BIOS oddity
&gt;metioned below?

I don't think it's an APM BIOS oddity at all;
see below.

&gt;I will send out a patch shortly.

OK, thanks.

&gt;Hmm...  Without acpid running, ACPI certainly is
&gt;not doing the suspend.  It sounds like APM is
&gt;actually doing your suspend.  How can that be
&gt;if APM is not engaged?  Strange (illegal?)
&gt;behavior of the APM BIOS.

Huh?  You don't need to enable APM BIOS in Linux in order to use
APM features, it just makes Linux able to find out what you have
done...  Many laptops with a suspend feature will suspend just
fine with Linux running but no APM support in Linux; Linux will
just be confused about the time when it wakes up because it will
not know that it went to sleep.

So, of course the APM bios is doing the suspend, even though I
have no enabled APM bios support in the kernel.  This is not
unusual or unexpected or buggy behaviour; I just wanted to
point out that in APM mode, the suspend key works, therefore I
would expect that in ACPI mode the suspend key would generate an
event.

Thanks for explaining how to figure out what event it is; I'll
try it.  Unfortunately, I've got other problems with the 2.3.99
kernels on this machine that prevent me from doing any real work
with it (my modem/ethernet card isn't supported, for example) so
I have to alternate between working on the kernel and dealing
with email.  :-(

&gt;Running in ACPI mode, the BIOS expects the OS
&gt;(drivers) to spin down the harddrive whereas
&gt;with APM, the BIOS takes care of all of that.
&gt;For ACPI we need additional driver support
&gt;for suspend/resume including HD/IDE/PCI
&gt;PM work.

OK, I wasn't sure if the AML code explicitly tried to do all that
or not.

I'm a little worried about this because our standard hard drive
spin down code does not work.  I think that it might just be
turning off power to the drive somehow, though I haven't spent
enough time with the disassembled AML to be sure.

The problem is not how the bytestream should be interpreted.  If you
had followed my reference to section 6.4, you would have seen that it
is documented there.

The problem is that these _{C,P,S}RS objects are control methods that
when run return a bytestream.

Here's the problem:
1) The disassembler can't run the control methods.
2) The standard does not say how the _{C,P,S}RS methods should be
   coded.
Therefore, any attempts to decode these will HAVE to be heuristic attempts;
from what I see in the AML on my machine, I can look for a Record inside a
control method and guess that it will contain a bytestream to be so
interpreted.  But it is impossible to know for certain.

So there are two questions:
1) Is it worthwhile to try to parse these streams in the disassembler?
   I think so, especially because that there are standard ASL macros that
   create recognizable objects specifically for the purpose of creating
   these control methods.
2) Does Andy mind me mangling his disassembler to perform these functions?

I'm sorry if this post is rather trivial or answers have been given in
former posts, but I browsed the archive and found nothing appropriate,
at least not for a non-developer like me. 

I enabled acpi support (kernel is 2.3.99-pre2), and there is the
/proc/sys/acpi tree, but obviously it is all non-functional. Neither
would the system power off on shutdown nor is there any way to set it to
sleep or hibernation. I tried "echo 1 &gt; .." with all proc entries that
seemed relevant, but the result was all negative. 

Now my questions would be, what precautions are to be taken or which
conditions have to be met in order to make acpi modes operate in Linux?


System data (I don't know what is actually relevant)

Athlon CPU
Asus K7V Mainboard, ACPI BIOS REV 1003
AWARD medaillon bios v6.0



I hope someone finds time to lighten my views a little.

First, you need to install acpid (available from
the ACPI4Linux website).  Then, run it as

  acpid -d

so that you get debug output to the console.

I think it is not disassembler's job,but AML interpreter shell's 
(AML debugger's) job. Bytestreem interpretation exists in  
different layer from AML interpretation.

Name(_CRS,Buffer{...}) type may be interpreted in disassembler.

But the type such as 
Name(CRSR,Buffer{.....})
Method(_CRS){
	CreateWordfield(CRSR,0x1,AAAA)
	Store(42,AAAA)
	return(CRSR)
}

or 
Method(_CRS)
{
	Name(BUFF,Buffer{....})
	CreateWordField(BUFF,0x4,BBBB)
	Store(8192,BBBB)
	return(BUFF)
}
is difficult.

More over,

Method(_SRS,1){
	CreateWordField(Arg0,0x1,CCCC)
	Store(119,CCCC)
}

needs to give Arg0 buffer filled with PnP Encoded data.

The APM driver does NOT handle the suspend key.  The
APM bios does that if ACPI is not enabled.

Perhaps "does NOT handle" is misleading.  What I'm trying to
say is that the existence of APM support on the Linux kernel
doesn't have anything to do with whether the suspend key
tries to suspend when the APM bios is active.  That should
be clearer...

I suspect we cannot get at the suspend key event
before turning on ACPI as the APM BIOS handles it
transparently.  When we turn on ACPI, the suspend
key will stop being handled by the APM BIOS and,
hopefully, begin generating an ACPI event.  If
the suspend key generates an ACPI event then, yes,
we can make it suspend the system (or really do
whatever you want).

The standard says, in section 6.1.4, that a _HID object evaluates
either to a string or to a 32-bit EISA ID.  I find this fragment
in my AML disassembly:

0000365a:       Device PIC_ (\_SB_.PCI0.PX40.PIC_)
00003661:         Name _HID (\_SB_.PCI0.PX40.PIC_._HID)
00003666:           0xd041

Clearly, that's not a DwordObject, nor is it a string.

Am I justified in reporting this to Dell as a bug, or is there
something I don't know?

I notice that plenty of the EISA IDs are ???d041 on this machine.

I also notice some HIDs with non-ascii characters; particularly
nulls, which show up as @'s when decoded:

000008c2:   Device MEM_ (\_SB_.MEM_)
000008ca:     Name _HID (\_SB_.MEM_._HID)
000008cf:       @HLd041 (0x010cd041)

I'm pretty sure that my decoding is correct, unless I have misunderstood
something in the PnP BIOS specification fragment that I posted here.

Can anyone enlighten me?

Thanks!

Oh, and for Takanori Watanabe when you read this patch: yes, I'm
quite aware that a _HID can also be a method that evaluates to an
EISA ID or a string -- I'm not trying to catch every instance,
just trying to make reading your average acpidisasm output easier.
So you don't need to tell me that a _HID object can be a method
and that my check here will not give me the EISA ID for every
possible _HID object; I know that already.

Oh, that.  I don't think that matters.  I can't
imagine who cares if suspend works correctly
during system boot time.  I expect that acpid
will be started early in the boot process anyway,
so I don't think it matters very much one way or
another.

I wasn't reporting that as a bug, which was why
I was confused when you treated at as one.  :-)

&gt;If the suspend key generates an ACPI event then, yes,
&gt;we can make it suspend the system (or really do
&gt;whatever you want).

And, as mentioned elsewhere, it does.

I wonder if it would make sense to eventually do something
like have people press suspend twice in one second for
suspend to disk (if configured), and once only in order to
suspend to ram?  I suppose that might be too complex an
interface for some people.  :-)

Interesting, it looks like your suspend key is
handled through your embedded controller which
owns GPE 9.  The embedded controller also takes
care of battery on your system and other things
so upon receiving a GPE 9, we are going to have
to query the EC to determine if the event was
the suspend key, a battery event, or some other
EC event.

Do we even have an interface yet for querying the

the battery code in the new acpid just for kicks,
it hung when I tried to query it with acpictl.  I
didn't get around to doing any debugging or
investigation yet.

The EC is generally going to always be accessed
through control methods (the AML interpreter).
Whenever a control method accesses an OpRegion
marked as EC, the interpreter calls into the
EC driver.  All of that code is there now
but, as you see, I'm still kicking out a few
problems.

In message &lt;200004261523.RAA01126@bastable.devel.redhat.com&gt;, "Michael K. Johns
on" :
&gt;
&gt;In order to make the disassembler output for the _{C,P,S}RS Buffer ByteLists
&gt;a bit more readable (see section 6.4), I may need a bit more infrastructure.
&gt;It's trivial for me to change to being able to print out more than one line
&gt;per object and maintain indentation; I've figured that out.  Would it be
&gt;considered kosher for me to change the printing in util.c to look up the
&gt;parent of the parent of a bytelist and see if its name is _{C,P,S}RS, and if
&gt;so, to interpret the bytelist accordingly?

There are many systems that do something like this

  Name RCRS
    Buffer
      &lt;size&gt;
      ByteList &lt;...&gt;
  Method _CRS
    ArgCount 0; NotSerialized
    return
      RCRS

and this case would not be caught by the above
algorithm.  It's too bad we can't make an
intelligent guess from the contents of a buffer
whether it contains resources or not.

In any case, yes, it would be nice to make
a guess and output resources.  A command line
argument to acpidisasm should probably be used
to enable that.

&gt; BTW, if I make the changes to print more than one
&gt; line per object, I can
&gt; make it possible to print all ByteLists in their
&gt; entirety and leave off
&gt; the elipses...

Yes, sounds good.  Add a depth parameter or something
to acpi_sprint_op.  Oh, and better yet, get rid of
sprintf (and buffer_size) entirely and change them
to printf's or fprintf's.  That's getting to be
a big pain.

No, this is actually correct code.  If op is

Not unlike

acpi_enable is called only when acpid or the
user enables an ACPI event (by modifying
/proc/sys/acpi/gpe_enable or
/proc/sys/acpi/pm1_enable)  Take a look at
acpi_do_event_reg.

The driver doesn't do the enable immediately at
boot time because some broken ACPI implementations
screw up the interrupt remapping when ACPI is
enabled.  It's a lot easier to diagnose problems
and/or a crash post-boot.

If the problem that Michael Johnson has reported
to the list is actually valid behavior for APM,
I might need to do the acpi_enable a boot-time
anyway.  There is now the "acpi=no-sci" kernel
flag to avoid the broken ACPI implementations.
That way, more Linux 2.3 testers would find out
in a hurry if they are running on a system with
broken ACPI.

&gt; I have another problem which is more simple.
&gt; When powering off my laptop, the machine shutdown
&gt; correctly, then powers
&gt; down itself.
&gt; Now, what is not normal, is that just after powering
&gt; down, it goes up
&gt; again.

Does your system really power down completely?
(the power LED goes off, the fan stops)  So,
you are just seeing your system reboot?

request_irq hanging seems to mean that an IRQ

I can put in a simple check to acpi_irq to not

The "acpi=no-sci" flag makes the ACPI driver not
call request_irq or acpi_enable at all.  This is
useful for debug but with it, you get very
limited ACPI support (no ACPI events)

Is the NIC built into your motherboard?  Or an

OK, looks good.  Yes, creating new fake ops does
seem to be the least painful way to do it considering
non-recursive acpi_show and acpi_sprint_op.

I'll merge these changes into acpidisasm.

The fans will be on full-speed-ahead if we don't turn them off,
at least in all implementations I've seen.  Therefore, while
thermal zone support is important, it is not as important as
the other things that I listed.

&gt; 
&gt; But we already have this; I was concentrating on
&gt; what we don't have.

No, we have support for S1 on *some* systems.
We are not currently running the _PTS and _WAK
control methods before going into S1.  Now that the
interpreter is getting more stable with regard to
running control methods, I will be trying that soon.

Anyway, on some systems, you can get away without
running _PTS and _WAK but on others you can't.
This is why S1 support is explicitly marked
as "EXPERIMENTAL" in the kernel and is turned
off by default.

S2 and S3 support is completely lacking.  We need
wide driver power management support before these
work and we need 16 bit resume code.

So, I would definitely not take a "DONE" on
suspend-to-RAM.

&gt; &gt;  o Suspend to disk (S4)
&gt; 
&gt; As nice as that is, and as much as I want it, most
&gt; laptops do not seem
&gt; to have this working reliably under Linux with APM
&gt; so I count this as
&gt; less critical.  It's at least far lower on my
&gt; priority list than suspend
&gt; to RAM.  It's also much harder to get right.

OK, I'll go along with that.  S4 will certainly
be cool once it is working though.

&gt; &gt;  o Video blank
&gt; 
&gt; Again, my laptop blanks the video.  (Heh, even when
&gt; it's not supposed
&gt; to sometimes, as you saw from my bug report)  What's
&gt; missing here?

OK, we have screen blank when in console mode.  We
don't get screen blank when in X or SVGALIB but I
guess APM doesn't either (is that correct?).  When
APM does blank the console (see
apm.c:apm_console_blank) I believe it also turns off
the backlight (for laptops) saving a fair amount
of power.

Some systems provide this to ACPI through _PTS.
Again, this would just need a functioning
interpreter.

&gt; BTW, how important is it to implement the SMBus
&gt; functionality?  If
&gt; it is important, it doesn't look too hard; the only
&gt; thing I'm worried
&gt; about is bus enumeration.  The i2c code in the
&gt; kernel has what looks
&gt; like a nice interface that we can use for acpid and
&gt; which will easily
&gt; convert to a kernel interface once the aml
&gt; interpreter moves into the
&gt; kernel.

SMBus is fairly important to getting full support
for battery and thermal as it will be used to
access smart batteries and thermal sensors on many
systems.  Right, I believe we will be able to use
the i2c code already in the kernel but must admit
I haven't taken a close look yet.

Subject: [Acpi] disassembler enhancements


&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone worked on making the disassembler more useful by interpreting
&gt; some of the fields that are currently presented only in numeric format?
&gt; For example, it would be easier to read Field's FieldFlags and OpRegion's
&gt; RegionSpace if they were spelled out in the output.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure how to fit this into the architecture.  I have tried two
&gt; different approaches to breaking out FieldFlags and haven't been
&gt; successful because I tried to do it quickly without grokking the whole
&gt; structure...  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Andy, this is your code; any suggestions on how to do this cleanly?  I
&gt; am not sure that it makes sense to create fake ops and args for each
&gt; of these types of objects.  Perhaps I need a new construct of some
&gt; sort?  If acpi_sprint_op could eat following ops, I could do all the
&gt; mangling there -- e.g. if FIELD, then eat the following BYTECONST and
&gt; print it my own way.

&gt; Is there anything else missing that people are used

To be a complete replacement for APM, ACPI
additionally needs
  o Suspend to RAM (S1, S2, or S3 depending)
  o Suspend to disk (S4)
  o Video blank

The kernel-side support for Lid is already
there.  It's just a matter of looking up which
GPE correlates to the Lid for your system and
enabling it.

&gt; 
&gt; I've cleverly worded the subject to avoid assigning
&gt; blame for the bugs;
&gt; I don't know whose fault they are.

Right, ambiguity is useful that way  :)

Well, the fix will probably have to come from the
software side anyway so you might as well assign
blame there by default.

&gt; Here is what I have seen so far:
&gt; 
&gt;  o  Once only, acpid -d blanked the screen and the
&gt; screeen would not
&gt;     come to life again without a complete reboot. 

Now that is very odd.  Is this with the experimental
S1 support turned on?  The code paths for blanking
the screen from ACPI are not even accessible unless
you turn that on and even so will not be run unless
you do an explicit 'echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/sleep'

Could this be related to your APM BIOS oddity
metioned below?

&gt;  o  If I press the power button immediately after
&gt; starting acpid,
&gt;     it does a proper shutdown, but if I suspend
&gt; first (with the
&gt;     echo trick mentioned above) and then bring the
&gt; machine back to
&gt;     life with the power button, acpid reports all
&gt; further presses

Ah, yes, this one looks like a bug.  In acpi_enter_sx,
acpi_sleep_state should be returned to 0 following
the wake from S1.  Otherwise, acpid just thinks it
is being woken from S1 repeatedly.  I will send out
a patch shortly.

&gt;  o  The suspend key, which works without any
&gt; assistance (from text
&gt;     mode, anyway) without acpid running, quits
&gt; working entirely when
&gt;     acpid is running.  I would have assumed that it
&gt; is the sleep

Hmm...  Without acpid running, ACPI certainly is
not doing the suspend.  It sounds like APM is
actually doing your suspend.  How can that be
if APM is not engaged?  Strange (illegal?)
behavior of the APM BIOS.

acpid turns ACPI on when it is run (remaps the
SMI to the ACPI SCI and completely disables
APM) and that is why your APM suspend key
stops working.

Now, once ACPI is on, hopefully the suspend key
would generate an ACPI event.  You can
tell this from the disassembled AML or you
can figure it out experimentally as follows

  &lt;clean boot and don't start acpid&gt;
  # enable all fixed and general purpose events
  echo 0xffffffff &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/pm1_enable
  echo 0xffffffff &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/gpe_enable
  cat /proc/sys/acpi/event
  &lt;press suspend key&gt;

Now do you see an event occurring?  Hopefully,
otherwise this will call for modification of
the keyboard driver to support your suspend
key.

&gt;  o  Entering sleep does not spin down the hard
&gt; drive.  I don't know

Running in ACPI mode, the BIOS expects the OS
(drivers) to spin down the harddrive whereas
with APM, the BIOS takes care of all of that.
For ACPI we need additional driver support
for suspend/resume including HD/IDE/PCI
PM work.

this was *possibly* my mistake, my ABIT (BH6) really ought to have 

echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ

this is based on what Andy said. 

I am assuming the "wake up on..." should not affect the computer at all as
it should be in the S5 state - which is power off, completely.

just a thought.

There were fewer of these bitfields than I thought; I think I have
added them all now, and I fixed a few more bugs in my previous
patch (I keep forgetting not to use the word "perfectly" in reference
to source code...) and here's the whole thing, which seems to work
fine for me.

I have not included the amlop.{c,h} patches as they will be regenerated
when you run mkaml.

Again, let me know if you think these patches are bad and I can change

&gt;S2 and S3 support is completely lacking.  We need
&gt;wide driver power management support before these
&gt;work and we need 16 bit resume code.

They are not necessary to sufficiently replace APM in
the Linux context.  I am very explicitly talking about
meeting Linux users' expectations of ACPI that have been
set by APM.  I am trying to avoid talking about a complete
implementation in order to get something sufficiently
working in the short term.

This has nothing to do with marking any feature as "DONE".
This has only to do with marking features "will suffice
for the short term for people used to APM support under
Linux" or "will not satisfy people used to APM support
under Linux".

&gt;OK, we have screen blank when in console mode.  We
&gt;don't get screen blank when in X or SVGALIB but I
&gt;guess APM doesn't either (is that correct?).

Machine-dependent.  Some APM bioses save the video
state sufficiently, others don't.  My wife's VAIO
can save to disk from X mode and restore completely
and correctly, but that's unusual.  It's far more
common to have to switch to a text console before
suspending even to RAM, from what I have heard.

&gt;Some systems provide this to ACPI through _PTS.
&gt;Again, this would just need a functioning
&gt;interpreter.

I'm surprised that they are any that do not provide
this to ACPI.

&gt;SMBus is fairly important to getting full support
&gt;for battery and thermal as it will be used to
&gt;access smart batteries and thermal sensors on many
&gt;systems.  Right, I believe we will be able to use
&gt;the i2c code already in the kernel but must admit
&gt;I haven't taken a close look yet.

The Documentation/i2c directory has documentation that
should be sufficient for this purpose, I think.

From: Andrey Panin &lt;pazke@orbita.don.sitek.net&gt;
Subject: [PATCH] PCI quirk for VIA ACPI device

Hi all,

this patch (against 2.3.99-pre5) provides PCI quirk for VIA ACPI device (same as for \
Intel and ALI). Also modified PIIX4 and VIA support in /linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c \
to use ioport  base address from pci_dev structure.

Best  wishes,
                    Andrey

Subject: Re: [PATCH] PCI quirk for VIA ACPI device

Hello!

&gt; this patch (against 2.3.99-pre5) provides PCI quirk for VIA ACPI device (same as for Intel and ALI).
&gt; Also modified PIIX4 and VIA support in /linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c to use ioport 
&gt; base address from pci_dev structure.

&gt; +       pci_read_config_byte(dev, PCI_CLASS_REVISION, &amp;rev);
&gt; +       rev = (rev &amp; 0x10 ? 0x48 : 0x20);

   This doesn't look well -- in case you select 0x20, you end up with single
resource present in both resource[4] and resource[7], resulting in immediate
resource collision.

				Have a nice fortnight

&gt; the kernel boot does not progress any more. So I

Right, this doesn't look good if we are getting many
spurious interrupts on the ACPI IRQ.

&gt; the burst of keyboard irqs). IMHO, it's interrupt
&gt; related. The acpi
&gt; support modify the irq dispatching in a subtle way.

Yes, it sounds interrupt related.  The ACPI driver
isn't really doing anything that would affect
interrupt
dispatch besides registering to handle the
ACPI IRQ (request_irq).  This causes Linux to
unmask that interrupt so if it is spurious, that's
why you are seeing the problem after the request_irq.
So, if you build without ACPI (or APM for the heck
of it), do you get a "spurious interrupt" message
from the kernel?

&gt; &gt; I've heard of systems that reboot instead of
&gt; &gt; power off when they are told to go into S5.
&gt; &gt; Possibly a bug in your ACPI implementation.
&gt; [BERNARD Sebastien]  Maybe, how to check ?

Hmm..  Possibly look for an errata list from
your system vendor or a BIOS upgrade fixing
it.  That's about the best you can do.  You
could see what other operating systems that
support ACPI do on shutdown, if you have
them.

Um, why would op ever be null?  It's a pointer to a structure,
not op-&gt;opcode, so this isn't a ZeroOp handling method.

Works for me.  Thanks!

I'm working on ByteList parsing; I've got multi-line output looking
pretty good, just one more bug to nail I think before going on to
actually parsing the ByteLists.  Because it is heuristic, I'm printing
out the ByteLists in any case, and then if my heuristic holds true,
I'll print out my parsing afterwards.

Because I added multi-line printing, I made the output buffer much
bigger.  I needed to do that to have the parsed output show up anyway;
that will get rather large, I'm thinking.

Andy Henroid writes:

OK, that makes sense.  I was kind of hoping that
the ASL macros would make this all a de-facto standard.

&gt;and this case would not be caught by the above
&gt;algorithm.  It's too bad we can't make an
&gt;intelligent guess from the contents of a buffer
&gt;whether it contains resources or not.

Right.  Since I'm printing the ByteLists anyway,
and because they seem to be most common in the context
of resource descriptors, I'll parse them all and print
them if they make sense as resource descriptors.  If
the length tags don't add up to the total length of
the ByteList, then I'll assume that I just wasted some
CPU cycles and not print the list.  That's a better
heuristic anyway.

&gt;In any case, yes, it would be nice to make
&gt;a guess and output resources.  A command line
&gt;argument to acpidisasm should probably be used
&gt;to enable that.

Let's see how well my new heuristic works before
adding a command-line argument.

&gt;Yes, sounds good.  Add a depth parameter or something
&gt;to acpi_sprint_op.  Oh, and better yet, get rid of
&gt;sprintf (and buffer_size) entirely and change them
&gt;to printf's or fprintf's.  That's getting to be
&gt;a big pain.

Hmm, my approach seems simpler to me; take a look when I
finish before I hack it to pieces again.  I'll send the
multi-line patch when I have polished it off, but before
I do the ByteList parsing code.  Probably tomorrow, as
it's getting late here in .nl and I've got a fencepost
error somewhere.

As Andy says, the EC will be accessed through the EC driver. The driver
registers as an address space handler and operation region access from the
AML interpreter will be directed to that interface. Also, an EC-SMBus driver
will access the EC through the EC driver interface. SM  Bus device higher
level drivers (e.g. card reader) will therefore access the EC through the
card reader's access to the SM Bus driver. So there are two EC clients AML
and SM Bus.

The EC is generally going to always be accessed

Whenever a control method accesses an OpRegion
marked as EC, the interpreter calls into the
EC driver.  All of that code is there now
but, as you see, I'm still kicking out a few

Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings....

&gt;From the tarball I get a coredump in dsmethod.c/DsParseMethod.  It seems
that Entry-&gt;Object is NULL
and the routine doesn't check for it.  I put in a return 0 in this case

...better than before, but still no S5.

Running without -d hangs the system &amp; I need to reboot.

Just to add some of acpidisasm attention, I just tried to rewrite the
acpi_show function.
It's called acpi_show_alternate (same use as the other one, the second
parameter is the indentation amount,
just can safely put "" inside).
It is composed of two mutualy recursive functions and it's rushed code.
I had a hard to understand the difference between child and arg which is
not really obvious.
I guess I get it right. It's not quit readable for now. Maybe I can do
better.

  char prefix[80];

  sprintf(prefix,"%s  ",upper_prefix);

  printf("(\n");

  while (arg_current) {
    char buffer[MAX_SHOW_ENTRY];
    struct acpi_op *arg_of_arg,*child_of_arg;

    acpi_sprint_op(buffer, sizeof(buffer), arg_current);

    acpi_show_alternate(child_of_arg,prefix);
    /*      else
        printf("What to do ?\n");*/
    printf("\n");
    arg_current = arg_current-&gt;next;
  }

  printf("%s)\n",prefix);

}

It's clear that the debugger should have this capability.  No
arguments there.

However, I think that you are unnecessarily polarizing this
discussion.

&gt;Bytestreem interpretation exists in  
&gt;different layer from AML interpretation.

I'm very aware of that, as I think I have made clear.

Nevertheless, it will make our jobs easier when joe random
user has a problem with ACPI on his computer if we don't have
to log in or send him an expect script to interact with his
debugger.  It would be convenient if for at least some, perhaps
most, users, we can just look at their acpidisasm output and
easily see what's going on.

I already myself early in this discussion brought up the point
that you mention: that these resource descriptor bytestreams
can be created by arbitrary AML code.  However, it seems that
they are often put in as static ByteLists, and I'm going to
take a shot at automatically parsing them as resource
descriptors.

If it doesn't work, you can feel free to laugh at me, but in
the meantime I've found a way that I think will work.  You
can ignore it if you like.

This is a multipart MIME message.


OK, I've got this working on at least my DSDT, and it's ready for
debugging on other people's.

I was going to say that to apply this, you must have applied the
patch I sent yesterday that implements multi-line printing correctly.
However, I see that I didn't include it.  Therefore, I'm including
both patches as attachments to this mail.  The pmtools.multiline.diff
patch must be applied first, and the pmtools.resource.diff second.

Also, please note that the heuristics seem to work.  Of course, the
ByteLists that are munged before being returned by the control
methods don't get printed; that's as it should be.  All of the
ByteLists that it interprets as PnP resource descriptors really
are PnP resource descriptors; the heuristics work well.  And
that's without checksum calculation enabled -- I disabled it
because a simple u8 checksum failed; should I be using a u16 or
u32 checksum, or is there some other algorithm?  I'm sure it is
in the ACPI standard somewhere, but I haven't found it, so I
would appreciate a reference.  It will be trivial to enable checksum
calculation once I know how; the calculation is simply commented
out for now with a FIXME attached.

0xd041 is PNP0000.  i.e. AT Interrupt Controller.

You should notice that any XXX0000 PnP ID which will be compliled into WORD.
Also, recently sometime PnP ID is expressed as string. like "ACPI0003" or "*PNP0700".
So, your condition blanch for _HID/_CID should treat DWORD, WORD, and StringPrefix.


Following code fragment may converts a Packed ID in a byte stream to PnPID.
you can use and modify my code freely as public.  It's my sunday code.
But I cannot tell other parts.

DWORD dump_EISAID(BYTE * pAml,DWORD pos, DWORD *p)
{
 DWORD i=0;
 union EISAID id;
 char c1,c2,c3;

 printf("EISAID(\"");
 if(DWordPrefix == pAml[pos])
 {
  i++; // points DWORD as EISAID
  id.AsDWord = convert_endian(*p = READ_DWORD(pAml+pos+i));

  i += sizeof(DWORD);
 } else { // 0xAAAA -- XXX0000
  i++;
  id.AsDWord = convert_endian(*p = READ_WORD(pAml+pos+i));
 
  i += sizeof(WORD);
 }

 c1 = (char)(((id.AsDWord &amp; BIT30_26) &gt;&gt; 26) + 'A' - 1);
 c2 = (char)(((id.AsDWord &amp; BIT25_21) &gt;&gt; 21) + 'A' - 1);
 c3 = (char)(((id.AsDWord &amp; BIT20_16) &gt;&gt; 16) + 'A' - 1);
 printf("%c%c%c%02X%02X", c1,c2,c3, id.AsChar[1],  id.AsChar[0]);

 printf("\")");
#ifdef DEBUG_POS
 printf("/* p-&gt;EISAID = 0x%X */", *p);
#endif 
 return i;
}

&gt; &gt;The standard says, in section 6.1.4, that a _HID object evaluates

&gt; &gt;in my AML disassembly:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;Clearly, that's not a DwordObject, nor is it a string.

&gt; Should'nt it be treated as 0x0000d041?(PNP0000).I think there is

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I notice that plenty of the EISA IDs are ???d041 on this machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I also notice some HIDs with non-ascii characters; particularly

&gt; No.  If you take a look, the patch is not disabling

&gt;

&gt; By

&gt;

Hi,

I have kinda strange question: 

Is it possible to completely disable the power button
with the help of ACPI?

The reason for that is:

We have 70 workstations running Linux
and much more users who likes to push the power
button in every case they think something goes wrong.

Like when netscape hangs - they push P/B,
when something else hangs - they push P/B,
some of them push P/B instead of just logging out.

The result is corrupted filesystems...

Well, acpid seems to correctly shutdown the system
when the power is pressed, that's great,
but I just don't want the user to be able to reboot/shutdown at all.

Is there any way to make the power button make no action
when it's pressed, may be just write to syslog that poweroff
was attempted?
Don't think that opening up 70 boxes and unplugging the P/B cable :)
is a cute decision.

Thanks a lot,
Art.

Sure.  The easiest way, I think, is to just compile kernels with ACPI
support and then do
echo 0xffffffff &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/event
You can also easily modify acpid to do anything you like, including
system("w | mail sysadmin@wherever -s 'user trying to power machine off, tsk'");
or you can, as you suggest, use syslog there.

Modify
acpid-&lt;version&gt;/acpid/event.c:acpid_pwrbtn()
to your heart's content.

Yes, that works,
but if I keep the button pressed for more than ~4 seconds,
it immideately poweroffs.
How do I handle that?

Oops, I was forgetting that.

You can't.

That's a hardware feature, and cannot be overriden by software.

At least you can log who the offending users are more easily, and
not everyone knows to hold the power button down for more than
4 seconds to initiate an unmanaged power-off.

Subject: [RFC] Getting rid of useless daemons

We got rid of bdflush. We got rid of kerneld. We got rid of update.

Now I think it's time to get rid of apmd, acpid and devfsd.

apmd could be changed into an executable "callback", like kmod/modprobe. acpid
(as far as I know at least) is like apmd but also parses the ACPI tables (easy
to do within a boot script, at the same spot acpid would be loaded). devfsd is
also mostly a callback-like daemon with some on-load behavior.

Comments?

This one seems to work.  I'm still not sure about the endianness of
numbers as read in by parse.c -- I did all my assembly training on
m68k machines and so get easily confused by little-endian machines
-- but this patch doesn't break anything and does seem to decode
all my non-method _HID objects correctly (I have no _CID objects
on this machine).

Andy, this replaces my previous patch, and applies directly over
my multiline and resource descriptor printing patches.

&gt;No, I think using the compiler to fix broken or

Yes, it is definitely true that more vendors are
taking Linux seriously.

&gt;The value in an open-source compiler would be to
&gt;get vendors to generate the correct AML in the
&gt;first place.

Speaking of correct AML: one of the missing things
for writing a good ASL compiler is a large base
of known-good ASL code from which to start.
This makes the bootstrap process much harder.
The example code that is out there is somewhat
scanty, I think, and in particular I don't recall
that it really exercises all the parts of the
compiler.

&gt;Add plenty of warnings, don't let
&gt;them get away with all of the wrong code that
&gt;the MS compiler passes right through.

Another good point!  We need examples of wrong
code that the MS compiler allows.

And, of course, the compiler needs to do quite
a lot of syntactic analysis to warn about stupid
mistakes that are perfectly legal ASL but will
compile to a broken ACPI implementation, I
expect.

&gt;All of this closed spec work is definitely
&gt;in need of something along the lines of the
&gt;IETF, sample implementation before spec completion.

Absolutely!  The ACPI standard shows in many
ways (I'm sure you are far more aware of this
than I am) that specification proceeded
implementation.  For instance, I'm dead
sure that if anyone had tried to write an
interpreter for AML before they set the
language in stone, they would have made
changes that would have avoided the need
for your "extra op" handling in acpidisasm.

&lt;soapbox&gt;
Unfortunately, it appears that there is zero
interest on the part of the companies that
sponsor the ACPI specification on opening up
the process.  You may remember, Andy, that
when I tried to even drop an informal hint
about one thing that could be improved in the
standard without signing reams and reams of
papers, the member of the standards committee
said that if he listened to my suggestion, they
would be effectively forced NOT to implement
it no matter how good it was because I was
not a member of the cabal.  If you go to the
ACPI web site, they say the same thing right
out; they will not listen to suggestions for
the next draft unless you become a member of
their little clique.

There are much, much more serious problems
here than lack of a free compiler.  Lack of
commitment to truly open standards on the
part of the three main sponsors of the ACPI
standard is a key problem.  I mean, there
are wonderful people like Andy at all three
companies who really understand this, but
they are clearly not high enough up the
corporate ladder to set policy for the ACPI
standard.
&lt;/soapbox&gt;

So I'm not sure what a free compiler would do
to open up the process.  Seems like trying to
put out a forest fire with an eyedropper.

No, seriously, if someone really wants to turn the machine off, he will

If you display a big red blinking warning message then, you will achieve

The AML interpreter isn't required to be in the kernel for power
management (although I still think we might run into trouble if we send
devices to sleep using AML methods, as we don't currently reinitialize all
devices after acpid has started [for the full discussion, check out the
September 1999 archive at http://phobos.fs.tum.de/pipermail/acpi ]). For
configuration management, this is a different thing, since you need to
execute AML code in order to assign resources to devices. Since you don't
want to reassign resources after the system has booted (and this also
implies that you have access to the harddisks without ACPI enum, which may
not be true for future systems), you need the interpreter in the kernel.

Subject: howto get it working? no docs yet?

Dear developers!

I was really happy when I first found ACPI support in the kernel.
I didn't thought of user-space daemon for months ;-)
that's my stupidity.

Then I guessed that if apm needs a daemon then acpi will need it too.

So I downloaded the latest from geocities, compiled, I wrote some init scripts
too.

Now I have kernel 2.3.99-pre3. (and pre6-5)
I make lsmod
acpi 9800 0 (unused)
run acpid
and it is still unused.
I see 2 acpid running (i have 2 cpus on abit bp6)

So what?
Is it working?
ACPI only works with acpi compat. cards?
How can I see if my cards are acpi compat?

Thanks for your great work and efforts!
(ps. I could find no docs and readmes. SO that's why I mailind you.)

According to the doc (pm.txt), pm_callback should return -EINVAL "if the

request, or should it go to D2 state (nearest higher power state)?

The apm driver (and my code) just calls pm_send_all with state D3 on

-EINVAL.

A device that doesn't support D3 should fail the
D3 request.  The power management subsystem will
then know the device does not support D3 and will
try D2 and so on until it finds the deepest state
that the device does support.  (I say "will"
because right now the PM driver just stops at
the first failure.  The driver really needs to
comprehend device dependencies (device X is on
bus Y) before this will work correctly.)

Documentation addition, thanks.

&gt; You can verify that C-states work by running acpid
&gt; and looking for "ACPI Cx works" in the kernel log.

 Umn, ACPI Cx works?
 
&gt; (Note, this is if your system has ACPI tables,
&gt; otherwise you need to fill in C-state latency
&gt; values for /proc/sys/acpi/p_lvlX_lat.  Sorry,
&gt; this should probably go in the documentation

 The values are there...
 
 0x00000166 for p_lvl2_lat
 0x000002cc for p_lvl3_lat

&gt; A working S5 is verified by running acpid and
&gt; do "shutdown -h now".  Does you system power-off?
&gt; If not, S5 is not supported (check syslog) or
&gt; S5 is broken.  (This will not work at all unless
&gt; you have ACPI tables)

 Doesn't work, however this could also be a broken init.

&gt; You can verify that ACPI events work by running
&gt; acpid and pressing the power button.  Does the
&gt; system start to shutdown?

 No, nothing no one of the 2 buttons causes any reation.
 Well, pressing them longer will turn off the power....

 Back to apm...

A new version of acpid is now available from

 
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/

and soon after at the main ACPI4Linux website.

The changes from the last acpid release are primarily
internal and will have little user-visible effect
for now (significant parser/interpreter cleanup,
additional interpreter functionality, and better
stability running control methods)

Though not immediately apparent, this is a large
step forward for the interpreter and soon battery
and thermal support will follow.

&gt; Yeah, right on, post your patch.  It would be most
&gt; useful if it is a backport of the current 2.3 ACPI
&gt; driver to 2.2 but it could be useful even if not.

Ok, here it is.  Unfortunately it is not a backport.  It is a very simple
adaption of the patch for 2.2.9.  I wouldn't have a clue on how to backport,
I'm just a simple (l)user that wanted poweroff.

Unlike the standard patches it assumes that your source is the linux/, relative
to the current directory.  This was because it was aimed at normal users who
would not have the acpi/linux/ hierarchy setup.

&gt; Thermal and battery can be done up in userspace
&gt; by acpid for now.  Suspend probably won't come
&gt; along until 2.5.

Unfortunately not being at the "cutting edge" of ACPI I really don't know a lot
about this :).  I await kernel 2.4 so that I can be up to date.

First of all, thanks for the reply. It took me a while to look into
it, but here is what I found:

There was no "_TZ_" scope in the dump. However, towards the bottom in
the "_SB_" scope there is

    Device FAN0
      Name _HID
        0x0b0cd041

and that's it! There are no _ON or _OFF methods, nor a _TMP! I know
the system keeps track of the temperature, because it can be displayed
in BIOS. Is lm78 via I2O the only way to get this information?

I'd really like to cut the fans off.. I'll try upgrading the BIOS.

One more thing.. there are two fans, both plugged into the
motherboard: one for the CPU, and one for the case in general. They
have three wires each, which I take to mean that they have built-in
sensors. Only one fan showed up in the dump.

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Look within the "_TZ_" (thermal zones) scope.
&gt; Do you see a device called "FAN_" with HID
&gt; 0x0b0cd041?  Possibly with an attached power
&gt; resource with methods "_ON_" and "_OFF"?
&gt; (hmmm.. I wonder what those do :)  How about
&gt; a method called "_TMP" (current temperature)?

I'm releasing some power management test and

These were formerly called "acpitools" and now
"pmtools" because I've added an application that
is for general power management use (pmtest
which can be used by kernel developers to test
the power management support in their drivers).

acpidmp is unchanged and I've made a fairly
major parsing bug fix to acpidisasm.  pmtools

There were a bunch of patches against the 2.2 series, but they were
informational only (basically to help us dump the ACPI tables, so we could
get a view what different ACPI implementations are out there). So the
answer is "no", I'm afraid.

Hi - I saw the ACPI presentation at the Atlanta Linux Showcase '99 and
was very impressed.

I would like to control the fans in my desktop machine, which has an
ABIT 440BH motherboard. Apparently, this motherboard is ACPI friendly.
Is controlling the fans possible through ACPI, or should it be done
through some other mechanism?

If I remember correctly, controlling the fans on a laptop was one of
the abilities of ACPI. I hope this is also true of desktops.

Yes, depending on how complete the ACPI
implementation is on your laptop, it is probably
possible to control the fan and do other things
necessary for thermal control (eg. read the
current temperature).

Does the current ACPI driver on Linux support
thermal right now?  Well, unfortunately, no
it does not.  The biggest hurdle to thermal
support is completing the AML interpreter and
we are working on that right now.

Until then, it might be interesting to find out
if your laptop really does have ACPI thermal
support.  If you are curious, grab and build
the pmtools from the ACPI4Linux website
(http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/).  Then dump
your DSDT and disassemble the contained
AML.

I'm sorry, yes and to answer you original
question...  :)  Yes, on a fully ACPI enabled
_desktop_ you will also have thermal support,
including fan control.

System vendors have a lot of flexibility on
what ACPI features they support, so you might
want to check out your system as I describe in
the previous mail.

This should fix any build problems that people

Just a reminder that as of the next development
kernel release (2.3.52), you will need to upgrade
to the latest version of acpid.  People running

The previous version of acpid correctly identified S0 and S1 but not S5,
so something has changed which has made it worse...

This is my first attempt to get ACPI functioning but due to the lack of
documentation I am totally stuck
please help

I am trying to get ACPI to function on my TMCti5vga (via mvp) motherboard

I am running kernel 2.3.51 with ACPI enabled during boot it sees a VIA vp3
chipset

The board has a VP3 (586) Northbridge and an mvp4 Southbridge (686) though I
don't think this should matter in this case.

I have checked /proc/sys/acpi and have what looks like a working ACPI

I have the latest acpid

I then run /opt/acpid/acpid -d

I get

ACPID starting
unable to find ACPI namespace

I've checked the newsgroups but am unable to make any head way

Do I need to add tables somewhere

The board is ACPI compliant and functions correctly in NT2000

Yes, I've also seen that "hda - lost interrupt"

First, please make sure the lockup is related to
ACPI.  Does it happen with and without the ACPI
driver?

&gt; button doesn't work).  The acpid does get notified
&gt; of pressing the 
&gt; power button, and I did once see it writing INIT: 
&gt; switching to 
&gt; runlevel 0, however it stopped there, and didn't do
&gt; anything else.

Hmm..  It sounds like ACPI events are at least
working for you.  So, it freezes after "INIT:
switching to runlevel 0" ?  That sounds odd
possibly indicative of a problem elsewhere.
If acpi is the culprit, I would expect a freeze
right after the "power off" message (depending
on your Linux distribution)

Does "shutdown -r now" have the same problem?

&gt; All I really need is for the system to shutdown
&gt; correctly when I 
&gt; press the power button.  Is there a way to disable
&gt; everything else 
&gt; (like that hard disk thing)?

One thing to try is...

 1) cat /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ &gt; s5.txt
 2) Add 'acpi=chipset' to you kernel command line
    Probably just add 'append="acpi=chipset"' to
    your lilo.conf
 3) Reboot (hopefully it finds your ACPI enabled
    chipset)
 4) cat s5.txt &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/s5_slp_typ
 5) Shutdown or whatever

Sorry, kind of a pain.  Or you can just wait and
I'll make it easier to turn off C-states in my
next patch.

I'm still not convinced that C-states (and/or the
missing interrupt) are really the problem.

&gt; Someone posted a patch for 2.2.14.  Is there an
&gt; acpid that would 
&gt; work with that?  Do you keep olrder acpid?

No, actually, that patch was backported from a
fairly old ACPI patch.  It shouldn't really even
need acpid, but then I suspect that patch is also
not going to work for you if the 2.3 support
doesn't

It is definitely ACPI related.  It only happends after I run acpid, and 
it happens soon or right after I run acpid.

&gt; Hmm..  It sounds like ACPI events are at least

I was only able to do it once, so it normally my computer freezes 
before I'm able to do anything (With the hda-lost interrupt 
message).  That one time I was able to press the power button, 
and I saw the INIT message, but then I pressed enter, and I got the 
prompt back.  A second later the computer froze.

&gt; Does "shutdown -r now" have the same problem?

Can't get to do that.  As soon as I run acpid, the computer freezes.

Right, your DSDT and FACP look like they are in the
wrong format.  The table header do not comply to
the ACPI 1.0 spec at least.  This could very
well be an error on VIA's part.

You might want to try adding "acpi=chipset" to
your kernel command line and then at least you
could get processor power states (C-states) from
the ACPI driver.

Hi

I've seen this 

If the protection fault occurs just after run level 0 is reached it is
probably your BIOS not liking protected mode apm calls

Try enabling real mode call in the kernel (under APM)

Hope this helps

HI again,

Though in common with most people I want S5 escpecialy as APM is broken on my
machine (no protected mode), GPF's or seg faults machine depending on OS and as
ACPI functions in Mickeys offerings I hoped I could get at least S5 to function
in Linux.

I tried your sugestion just to see if I could start on the path of ACPI4Linux
:-)

But now the circle is complete, after using append=acpi=chipset, trying to start
ACPID results in 'unable to load ACPI namespace'.

I don't know if this will help but as the kernell starts acpi I get the message

&lt;6&gt;ACPI: "VIAVP3" found at 0x000f7170
&lt;3&gt;ACPI: unreserved table memory @ 0x07ff30c0!

What worries me is VIA VP3 as this is only true for my Northbridge

Also during CPU setup I get

&lt;4&gt;e820: 0009fc00 @ 00000000 (usable)
&lt;4&gt;e820: 00000400 @ 0009fc00 (reserved)
&lt;4&gt;e820: 00010000 @ 000f0000 (reserved)

&lt;4&gt;e820: 0000d000 @ 07ff3000 (ACPI data)
&lt;4&gt;e820: 00003000 @ 07ff0000 (ACPI NVS)

Which seems to disagree with ACPI about where the data starts

Maybe I'm shooting fish as I have very little experience with ACPI but any help
sugestions (besides burn my motherboard as I've already thought of that) .

Yes, documentation is somewhat lacking.  There
is some in the kernel source tree
linux/Documentation/pm.txt but it's pretty
minimal at this point.

I've been fairly busy addressing various platform
issues before the door on 2.3 slams shut (and
perhaps it already has).  Anyway, if anyone who
has gone through the process of getting ACPI
working on their system would like to write a
FAQ or something, everyone in the Linux community
would love to have it.

&gt; I get
&gt; 
&gt; ACPID starting
&gt; unable to find ACPI namespace

So, did it say "cannot load ACPI namespace" ?
If so, forward me your DSDT

  cat /proc/sys/acpi/dsdt | mail
andy_henroid@yahoo.com

and I can determine why the namespace load is failing.

&gt; Do I need to add tables somewhere

If, however, you have an empty /proc/sys/acpi/dsdt
that
probably means that your system/motherboard vendor
chose not to support ACPI even though your chipset
supports some ACPI features (notably processor
power states)

with my BH6, I get much the same output from

in terms of S1-5 however apicd shows (at least under 2.3.40 I can't get

not.

We have looked at this in the past and it seems like ABIT bioses are not
quite correct in their acpi implementation, although why windows works fine
is still a mystery.

As Andy say, ACPI specifies a thermal model but the policy is very rigid.
The platform is placed in either an "active" or "passive" cooling mode by
the OS-directed power management (OSPM) software that manipulates the APCI
interfaces - this is accomplished by using the _SCP control method. When in
active mode, OSPM must turn on and off active cooling devices (fans) as
indicated by notifications by the platform. In passive cooling mode, OSPM
will apply the thermal equation to reduce processor performance in lieu of
turning on fans to cool the system. If the system continues to get hot, both
active and passive means will be used to cool the system - based on
temperature pasing active and passive trip points.

Hi - I saw the ACPI presentation at the Atlanta Linux Showcase '99 and
was very impressed.

I would like to control the fans in my desktop machine, which has an
ABIT 440BH motherboard. Apparently, this motherboard is ACPI friendly.
Is controlling the fans possible through ACPI, or should it be done
through some other mechanism?

If I remember correctly, controlling the fans on a laptop was one of
the abilities of ACPI. I hope this is also true of desktops.

Thanks,

Hi Gord!

&gt; Does such a patch exist?  Or is there a CVS branch I can grab from somewhere
&gt; that contains the ACPI kernel code?  All I can seem to find everywhere are
&gt; the ACPI tools.

I have made I patch against 2.2.14.  If nobody here has any major objections I
would be happy to post it here.

I had suggested making a patch available before, but was told that that this
would be unadvisable as ACPI is very much under development.  Thats fair
enough, I suppose, the developers know best.  I suspect, however, that there
are a lot of simpletons like me who aren't worried about the advanced
functionality that isn't there yet, and just want powerdown support.

For this type of user a patch would be useful.  In my experience it has caused
no adverse effects, and has done exactly as I wanted - to power off.  A patch
could be made available that does this - with a strong disclaimer that it may
not work at all, and that people use it at their peril.

I'm happy to post my pre-prepared patch (based on the 2.2.9 patch) as long as
somebody gives the go-ahead.

&gt; it here.

Yeah, right on, post your patch.  It would be most
useful if it is a backport of the current 2.3 ACPI
driver to 2.2 but it could be useful even if not.

&gt; I had suggested making a patch available before, but
&gt; was told that that this would be unadvisable as ACPI
&gt; is very much under development.

Personally, I'm happy to see contribution in this
area.  The functionality that is there now in the
2.3 kernel (C-states, S5, and ACPI events) is
probably the same as what will end up in 2.4, so
there is really no good reason to wait if you want
to backport to 2.2.

Thermal and battery can be done up in userspace
by acpid for now.  Suspend probably won't come
along until 2.5.

Thanks,
Andy

&gt; 
[GP]  Yes, I was looking into backporting it myself, but the version of ACPI
in the latest 2.3 kernel seems to have a lot of dependencies on
features/changes in the 2.3 series (which makes it quite a daunting task to
backport it).  I tried just straight out copying the needed files to the
2.2.14 kernel, but found that it was very quickly turning into a 2.3.48
kernel (the version I was backporting from) because of all the dependencies.
I was hoping to avoid that.

Specifically, I'm looking for a version of the ACPI driver that will allow
for slowing down or stopping the CPU (with the computer still running), so I
don't think Sean's version would have what I need if it only supports power
down.  Does the version of ACPI in the 2.3 kernel series support CPU power
state control?

Thanks.

Yes, processor power state (C-state) control and
policy are in the current 2.3 ACPI driver.  Take
a look at the "acpi_idle" function in
linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c

Just a clarification, C-states are used when the
system is idle and actually stop processor
execution.  If you want to just slow the processor
(to control thermal output) that's called "processor
throttling" and that is not yet supported by the
ACPI driver.

Well, I didn't think Linus was going to go from
2.3.52-pre2 to 2.3.99-pre1.  Maybe it's me that
can't count?  :)

&gt; What about 2.4? Does acpi have chance getting in?
&gt; Have you heard anything from Linus?

Yes, the ACPI support that's in 2.3 now will be
in 2.4.  Hopefully, before 2.4 is done we'll also
have some platform errata fixes and more work
finished in acpid up in userspace.

A new version of acpid is now available from

 
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/

Changes
* Added framework for interfacing between userspace

* Cleaned up the build process

These changes will have little user visible effect.
I am still in the process of tracking down a parsing
regression on BH6's (S5 was working before but
now is marked as unsupported).  Also, working
towards thermal and battery support.

Yes, documentation is somewhat lacking.  There
is some in the kernel source tree
linux/Documentation/pm.txt but it's pretty
minimal at this point.

I've been fairly busy addressing various platform
issues before the door on 2.3 slams shut (and
perhaps it already has).  Anyway, if anyone who
has gone through the process of getting ACPI
working on their system would like to write a
FAQ or something, everyone in the Linux community
would love to have it.

&gt; I get
&gt; 
&gt; ACPID starting
&gt; unable to find ACPI namespace

So, did it say "cannot load ACPI namespace" ?
If so, forward me your DSDT

  cat /proc/sys/acpi/dsdt | mail
andy_henroid@yahoo.com

and I can determine why the namespace load is failing.

&gt; Do I need to add tables somewhere

If, however, you have an empty /proc/sys/acpi/dsdt
that
probably means that your system/motherboard vendor
chose not to support ACPI even though your chipset
supports some ACPI features (notably processor
power states)

&gt; No, this doesn't sound like a rookie question to
&gt; me.  It might very well be a bug in acpid.  It
&gt; appears that acpid is having trouble parsing your
&gt; DSDT (one of the ACPI tables).

I now compiled a 2.3.99pre2 kernel, and acpid loaded.  
/proc/sys/acpi/dsdt still seems to output junk.  However, soon after 
I load acpid, I get hda - lost interrupt, which will soon after lock up
the system entirely (ctrl-alt-del doesn't work, and the power off
button doesn't work).  The acpid does get notified of pressing the
power button, and I did once see it writing INIT:  switching to
runlevel 0, however it stopped there, and didn't do anything else.

All I really need is for the system to shutdown correctly when I 
press the power button.  Is there a way to disable everything else 
(like that hard disk thing)?

Someone posted a patch for 2.2.14.  Is there an acpid that would 
work with that?  Do you keep olrder acpid?

I would appreciate your help!

Can you give this patch a try when you get a moment?
It is against 2.3.99-pre3-8 but should apply cleanly
against any recent kernel.

Build and add

  acpi=no-c2,no-c3

to your kernel command line.

Let me know if that works.

Hi

By updating the kernel to 2.3.99-pre2 I've cleared the 'unable to load namespace
problem' thanks Thomas.
But things go from bad to worse

acpid: started
acpid: FACP loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/
acpis: DSDT loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/
acpid: S0 not supported
acpid: S1 not supported
acpid: S2 not supported
acpid: S3 not supported
acpid: S4 not supported
acpid: S5 not supported
acpid: no processor block

Which on first look appears to sugest the acpi program works and I have no ACPI
except in both win98se2 and NT2000 ACPI functions and at the very least S5
should function.

If you look at DSDT and FACP it looks like they are garbage not what I would
have expected at all

Do you tjhink this is related to my hybrid chipset (586 Northbridge 686a
Southbridge) can the program not find my acpi bios.

This patch is against 2.3.99-pre3

Changes
* Added new kernel/module command line options to

  (In the future, problematic platforms will be

Apply the patch I just sent out (or wait for the

This should at least get you past your "unreserved

&gt; Which seems to disagree with ACPI about where the

The first message

  ACPI: "VIAVP3" found at 0x000f7170

is for your RSDP and will be in low memory
probably marked as "(reserved)".  The second
message

  ACPI: unreserved table memory @ 0x07ff30c0!

is the ACPI driver searching for your RSDT and
that appears to fall in an "(ACPI data)" area
which is good.

&gt; Maybe I'm shooting fish as I have very little
&gt; experience with ACPI but any help
&gt; sugestions (besides burn my motherboard as I've
&gt; already thought of that) .

Well, give the above fix a try and let me know.
If that works for you, I can add an entry for
your system to the errata list and you will
not have to use kernel command line options
after that.

Is it possible to create a proc device that you could write "1" to and

All I need, really, is for the machine to shutdown, then poweroff, after
I press the power button.  Is that possible with the patch?

Why doesn't it work?  Do I need acpid for it?

A kernel with the pach doesn't power off after I run shutdown, and
doesn't recognize my power button at all.  acpid will refuse to work
(that's probably because I'm using a newer version of acpid).

I will try this.  I don't understand though, why APM would work if I

&gt; How can I do same than apm -s with ACPI ?

"-s" run a command just before suspending the
system, right?  Suspend (aka S1-S4) is only
partially implemented at this point and will
only work on a limited set of ACPI systems.
And suspend is currently user-initiated (echo 1 &gt;
/proc/sys/acpi/sleep) not system/BIOS initiated
so, if you have a working S1, just run whatever
command before doing the "echo"

&gt; How do I make ACPI free the IRQ that it wants to use

The only way to keep ACPI from grabbing its IRQ
is to turn it off (add "acpi=off" to the kernel
command line or disable ACPI before building the
kernel)  ACPI is friendly about how it grabs the
IRQ and allows it to be shared with other devices
(it's not uncommon to see the ACPI IRQ shared
with other motherboard devices) but you may
see performance problems if ACPI shares with a
device that generates a lot of interrupts.

Right. It's more for bulletproofing than anything else.

For some chips, the ACPI and the SMBus are pretty well separated
and for others we aren't so sure - and it will help
our support to users if there's one more possibility we
can eliminate. Especially since you get port locations
from the BIOS.

thanks for adding the check.

&gt; 
&gt; Actually, wake-on support is not yet there so

&gt; we need to be cognizant of what D-state a

&gt; bit more complicated than that when we take
&gt; into account buses.  You end up with a matrix
&gt; of S-state to D-state mappings for each device
&gt; on your system.
	Well, except for the bus thing, I pretty much tought that a database is
needed of the devices and their D-states. I actually understood
something from that spec. Wow!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; what drawbacks are there because the idle loop for
&gt; &gt; smp systems is not yet done?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you don't get ACPI C2 and C3 processor
&gt; power states right now on multiprocessor
&gt; systems.  So you don't save as much power as
&gt; you potentially could.  I believe Linus
&gt; initially pulled out this support as he was
&gt; unsure what the implications to SMP are and
&gt; it seemed like the safe thing to do.  I
&gt; might add that back as experimental so that
&gt; people who really want it could enable and
&gt; try it out though.
	I think C1 is enough for most people (my Celerons cool down nicely when
idle).

&gt; &gt; For my board (abit bp6), the flags field in the facp
&gt; &gt; table is 0. This
&gt; &gt; would mean that the RTC can't wake up the system
&gt; &gt; from s4 (soft-off),
&gt; &gt; which it can, and because wbind=0 and flush_s*
&gt; &gt; fields are also 0, it
&gt; &gt; would mean that onyl S0 is valid, but win2k supports
&gt; &gt; sleep while in acpi
&gt; 
&gt; So what makes you think they are doing S2 or S3?
&gt; They could easily be doing S1 which doesn't
&gt; require a cache flush.  No?  It would be hard
&gt; to tell the difference between S1, S2, and S3
&gt; from a user's perspective (ie. without a power
&gt; meter)

	What I meant is that the entire flag field is 0, which means no support
for RTC to wake up the system from S4. But from S5 (soft-off), the RTC
starts my computer; at 3:05 am my local time (01:05 UTC), my computer
started by itself as directed from bios. So S4 is optional, but S5
(S2/S3, as stated by the specs, are mandatory) works? Couldn't find in
the specs info about RTC versus S5.
	Also, I understood that the RTC wakeup is programmed through standard
rtc stuff, e.g. /dev/rtc under linux. But ACPI has extended the alarm
definition of RTC by day,mon, century. The FACP table shows only these
new fields, the /proc/driver/rtc show the hh:mm:ss, but where can you
program the day/mo/cent?

&gt; &gt; wouldn't it be better to inform bios at boot about
&gt; &gt; which interrupt model
&gt; &gt; does linux use through the \_PIC method? Or linux
&gt; &gt; does this already? the
&gt; &gt; acpi specs says that on boot, the bios assumes
&gt; &gt; legacy (at-style
&gt; &gt; interrupt model, 0-15 irqs) mode. maybe the
&gt; &gt; activation of apic by linux
&gt; &gt; informs bios of this and \PIC isn't necessary, and
&gt; &gt; maybe not.
&gt; 
&gt; Right, I believe Linux can already do the correct
&gt; detection.  To use the ACPI \_PIC method at boot
&gt; time, we would need to have an AML interpreter
&gt; running in the kernel.  And that is another [near]
&gt; future hurdle for ACPI support on Linux.
	What I meant was not detection of the APIC, but (as I understood) by
\_PIC the operating systems informs the bios that it has switched to the
APIC mode of operation, as opossed to legacy. What I figure in my head
is this:
Current status:
	1. linux boots
	2. linux detects I/O APIC and switches the hardware part to it
Ideal status:
	+3. linux through acpi informs the ACPI compliant BIOS that it now uses
the APIC
What uses are there for \_PIC? Don't know, maybe ACPI 2.0 (to be
released today) will have some.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sleep S4 by OS would mean complete memory dump onto
&gt; &gt; a file, and on boot
&gt; &gt; a complete memory restoration. Is the linux kernel
&gt; &gt; design up to do this?
&gt; &gt; The restoration part, of course on shutdown cat
&gt; &gt; /dev/kmem &gt;
&gt; &gt; /boot/memory.dump is easy.
&gt; 
&gt; Right, the memory dump and restore is fairly
&gt; trivial.  The bigger problem is getting device
&gt; drivers to save and restore context so that
&gt; when you come back from sleep, your devices
&gt; are still working.  That's what the new
&gt; device power-management interface I've been
&gt; working on (kernel/pm.c) should begin to
&gt; address.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the questions.

&gt; What is the status of suspend to disk?  I have a

&gt; least win98 is able to do it.  What is the status of
&gt; ACPI suspend to disk under Linux?

Actually, there is quite a bit of work to do
between now and seeing suspend to disk working,
including
1) finish and integrate the AML interpreter
2) driver support for suspend/wake
3) memory/CPU context to disk (not needed for S4BIOS)

So, yeah, "everything"..  You will probably see
most other ACPI features (battery, thermal,
device PM, etc.) working before suspend to disk
because they are smaller in scope and/or a building
block for suspend.

&gt; I wouldn expect the ACPI suspend to disk and standby
&gt; to leave the hardware in the same state after it
&gt; comes back up.  It seems to me the standby turns
&gt; off all power except to memory, and all the rest of
&gt; the devices would be off just like turning the
&gt; system off.

Right, devices are going to lose context when
the system goes into ACPI S2, S3, and S4/S4BIOS
(suspend to disk) states.  The power management
subsystem needs to make sure that every driver
saves device context before suspend/standby
and restores it on resume.  When you hit the
power/wake button, your system should spring
back to life in the same state as it suspended.

&gt; I haven't looked at the ACPI stuff in a while, is
&gt; the ACPI development tree quite a bit different
&gt; from what the ACPI is in the kernel?

No, the development kernel contains the current
ACPI support.  There is a fair amount of code
and development going on up in userspace right
now.  acpid contains really the bulk of the
ACPI implementation (ie. the AML interpreter)

Hi,

I've looked a bit at the generic power-manager interface in later 2.3
kernels. It looks quite nice, and we will probably use it for some 
embedded linux stuff we're working on.

This stuff will not be acpi or apm though, but rather a custom, more
limited power management driver. One thing it need to do though, is to
power off separate drivers. For this i would like to be able to call
pm_send(), which right now is static. Is there any possibility to export
this function?

I have another comment about the pm.h interface:

After being waked from sleeping mode, or when pm_undoing a failed request
i like for all devices to return to their previous state, not D0. This
would require an "int last_state" in struct pm_dev. (Maybe there needs to
be an exported pm_undo_all() too...)

In this way my user space daemon can have full control of what devices are
enabled at all time, devices don't mysteriously change state under its 
feet. They only change state when told so, or goes to their min power 
state when sleeping (but return when waking up).

What do you think about this? How does it fit in the ACPI model? (I don't
know very much about ACPI.)

Subject: check_region in acpi.c

Hello again from lm_sensors.

In tracking down a bug in one of our lm_sensors drivers,
I noticed that you do not have check_region() calls before each
request_region() call in your acpi_claim_ioports() routine
in drivers/misc/acpi.c.

In the case where your driver was loaded after ours,
it would help us find potential conflicts between our drivers
and yours if you had check_region() calls as we do.

Would you please consider adding them?
thanks

&gt; 	Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I have a few question which popped up after reading

&gt; Here they are, I hope
&gt; you can clarify some things for me:
&gt;

Well, you don't get ACPI C2 and C3 processor

you potentially could.  I believe Linus
initially pulled out this support as he was
unsure what the implications to SMP are and
it seemed like the safe thing to do.  I
might add that back as experimental so that
people who really want it could enable and
try it out though.

&gt; would a complete acpi implementation for the kernel
&gt; add a new option to
&gt; the kernel, because now we have in General
&gt; Options-&gt;"PCI Support: 1.
&gt; BIOS; 2. Direct; 3. Any", and 4 (not only for PCI)
&gt; ACPI DSDT Table, or
&gt; maybe isa card discovery by acpi, as oposed to pnp?
&gt; the ACPI 1.0b specs
&gt; state that a complete pci discovery _can_ be done by
&gt; acpi, but system
&gt; makers are not required to do so.

Actually, ACPI leaves enumeration and configuration
of devices on self-enumerable buses (eg. PCI) up to
the bus (or bus driver) itself.  So, no, ACPI
configuration will not be used for PCI devices.

ACPI can and will, however, be used for setting up
PCI interrupt routing and enumerating/configuring
devices on non-self-enumerating buses like ISA.

&gt; if FACP/int_model is 0 (=standard dual pic
&gt; implementation), this doesn't
&gt; conflict with the fact that my smp board has an
&gt; apic, and linux uses it
&gt; - which should read as int_model=1? should I again
&gt; suspect an incomplete
&gt; (or broken) bios implementation?

Yeah, I don't know on the specifics of this one.
Incomplete ACPI implementation sounds possible.

&gt; Do you know if Celerons support WBINDV? If the term
&gt; victim cache means
&gt; L2 cache, the support of WBINDV would mean the only
&gt; method of supporting
&gt; S2/S3 on these processors.

Don't know off the top of my head (though I
probably should).  The cache can also be flushed
manually with FLUSH_SIZE and FLUSH_STRIDE.

&gt; For my board (abit bp6), the flags field in the facp
&gt; table is 0. This
&gt; would mean that the RTC can't wake up the system
&gt; from s4 (soft-off),
&gt; which it can, and because wbind=0 and flush_s*
&gt; fields are also 0, it
&gt; would mean that onyl S0 is valid, but win2k supports
&gt; sleep while in acpi

So what makes you think they are doing S2 or S3?
They could easily be doing S1 which doesn't
require a cache flush.  No?  It would be hard
to tell the difference between S1, S2, and S3
from a user's perspective (ie. without a power
meter)

&gt; mode. this could mean:
&gt; 	1. linux doesn't read correctly the flags field or
&gt; flush_stride/flush_size, or 
&gt; 	2. the bios is broken, or
&gt; 	3. win2k sees that I have 2 celerons and deducts
&gt; the flush_size and
&gt; flush_stride accordingly.

#3 is possible but I suspect you are just getting S1

&gt; I didn't exactly understand the s4bios_f flag from
&gt; the facs table. for
&gt; me it is 1, so it means that the hardware can do
&gt; suspend to memory? so i
&gt; can soft-off the computer (no hdd, no vga, no nic,
&gt; no soundcard, no
&gt; keyboard) and still the memory is maintained?

S4BIOS is firmware suspend to disk and is just
an interim solution until all OS's support real S4.
To make it work you usually have to set up a
special partition on your harddisk.  Then, when
initiated, the BIOS takes care of saving and
later restoring system context.

&gt; wouldn't it be better to inform bios at boot about
&gt; which interrupt model
&gt; does linux use through the \_PIC method? Or linux
&gt; does this already? the
&gt; acpi specs says that on boot, the bios assumes
&gt; legacy (at-style
&gt; interrupt model, 0-15 irqs) mode. maybe the
&gt; activation of apic by linux
&gt; informs bios of this and \PIC isn't necessary, and
&gt; maybe not.

Right, I believe Linux can already do the correct
detection.  To use the ACPI \_PIC method at boot
time, we would need to have an AML interpreter
running in the kernel.  And that is another [near]
future hurdle for ACPI support on Linux.

&gt; Sleep S4 by OS would mean complete memory dump onto
&gt; a file, and on boot
&gt; a complete memory restoration. Is the linux kernel
&gt; design up to do this?
&gt; The restoration part, of course on shutdown cat
&gt; /dev/kmem &gt;
&gt; /boot/memory.dump is easy.

Right, the memory dump and restore is fairly
trivial.  The bigger problem is getting device
drivers to save and restore context so that
when you come back from sleep, your devices
are still working.  That's what the new
device power-management interface I've been
working on (kernel/pm.c) should begin to
address.

Thanks for the questions.

With these you can dump your ACPI tables (acpidmp),
display the fields (acpitbl), and disasemble
the AML in the DSDT (acpidisasm)

&gt; I can set the resources with _CRS, should I then

&gt; traditional way (that is, via inb on configuration
&gt; registers) or that
&gt; would be enough? I didn't really understand the
&gt; workings of ACPI yet.

The ACPI driver does not yet do device configuration
so you will have to rely on the default configuration
by the PCI, ISA, ... subsystems or hand configure.
ACPI system/device configuration is definitely in
the works though, and is fairly high priority.

I had already 'tried' that. But I can't figure out how to use it. I can
dump the table with acpidmp, but I can't use the other utils. I'm not sure
how to use them, I tried piping them with acpidmp. It would be nice to
have a README or something.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello again from lm_sensors.
&gt; 
&gt; In tracking down a bug in one of our lm_sensors
&gt; drivers,
&gt; I noticed that you do not have check_region() calls
&gt; before each
&gt; request_region() call in your acpi_claim_ioports()
&gt; routine
&gt; in drivers/misc/acpi.c.
&gt; 
&gt; In the case where your driver was loaded after ours,
&gt; it would help us find potential conflicts between
&gt; our drivers
&gt; and yours if you had check_region() calls as we do.
&gt; 
&gt; Would you please consider adding them?

I'll add the check_regions in the next patch.
OK, so this will help with debugging but, of course,
you can't share or grab the ACPI I/O ports.

Hi,

I've added automatic dependencies to the Makefiles. The rules will only be
activated if the Make variable DEPS is set to a non-NULL value, so if you
set this variable when compiling, make will respect changes to header
files in the correct way. The default for this is off.

What is the status of suspend to disk?  I have a Toshiba laptop and it
looks like ACPI is the only way to get the laptop to suspend to disk.  At
least win98 is able to do it.  What is the status of ACPI suspend to disk
under Linux?

&gt; Right, the memory dump and restore is fairly
&gt; trivial.  The bigger problem is getting device
&gt; drivers to save and restore context so that
&gt; when you come back from sleep, your devices
&gt; are still working.  That's what the new
&gt; device power-management interface I've been
&gt; working on (kernel/pm.c) should begin to
&gt; address.

I wouldn expect the ACPI suspend to disk and standby to leave the hardware
in the same state after it comes back up.  It seems to me the standby turns
off all power except to memory, and all the rest of the devices would be
off just like turning the system off.

I haven't looked at the ACPI stuff in a while, is the ACPI development tree
quite a bit different from what the ACPI is in the kernel?

I can't seem to find out what exactly this field is in the processor
declaration (ACPI v1.0b specification, pg. 267).  We have the value
0x410 as the default for PR0 and 0x0 for PR1; this is for
(mostly) Pentium II, Celeron and P III machines.  The one I'm working on
now is a dual-PIII.  The documentation for the PIII lists some
model-specific registers 64 bits wide that I thought might correspond to

Maybe a better question is, what does the OS do with this field for the
processor definition?

Depending on the length of the PR0 and PR1 objects, the P_BLK I/O registers
are used to control CPU clock throttling and entry into the C2 and C3 CPU
states.  These registers will likely be in the chipset (such as PIIX4) as
opposed to the CPU.

Most BIOS vendors will use inappropriate values on multiprocessors systems
as yours seems to be.  The spec requires that all processors have symmetric
power state support.  Most chipsets only support CPU throttling and C2/C3 on
single processor systems.  The fact that PR1 uses the value 0x0 indicates
that it doesn't support clock throttling but PR0 does because it has the
value 0x410.  This is asymmetric and the OS will never enable clock
throttling.  The values are OK for a uniprocessor OS but they should both be
0x0 for a multiprocessor OS.

Works perfect on my TX97-XE and P3B-F, but unfortunately... the
systems doen't power off... (as expected).

&gt; * Mark S1 on sleep as experimental

With this option activated, the P3B-F crashes and the TX97-XE
disappears for about 1 s and resumes, fully functional. (echo "1"
&gt;sleep)

With this option unchecked nothing happend after echo "1" &gt;sleep, as
expected.

Right, the patch includes no new functionality
or work-arounds for platform problems so this
all sounds expected.  The goal is really to
fix some changes that Linus made, solidify
the build with ACPI+APM issue (use one or
the other not both), and turn off S1 by
default for safety.

Thanks,
Andy

Hi,

This small patch adds support for VIA 82c586 ACPI device.
It is usefull for motherboards with VIA chipsets but without ACPI tables (like
my FIC PA-2012).

This patch was tested on my machine and seems working (C2, C3 states, software
power-down).

Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,

i`ve sent this to both lists as i think it may be relevant.
i`ve also posted it to comp.os.linux.development.system

since 2.3.34/2.3.35 up until 2.3.39 (last tested)
when apm has been configured and the new kernel has
been installed the system seemingly hangs at startup
with the message
"ACPI C?" where ? is a number
the file seems to be arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c
(i think)
pressing a key moves the boot process which is _very_
slow a bit further.  this happens whether acpi is on or 
off and apm is on.  when both acpi and apm are off
it works fine.

where has the option for power off on shutdown gone?
i`ts not in menuconfig anymore but i can see the option
in 2.2.14

cheers

Hello,

I have some problems with ACPI and/or apm together with my AMD Athlon on
a MSI MS-6167 Rev 1.0b mobo.

When ever I enable apm I can't poweroff the machine. I've checked the
CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF, too. But no success:-(

Under Win98 (SE) it works...

If I enable ACPI my machine hangs during system boot.
Are there any problems with shared interrupts and ACPI?
ACPI, my EtherExpress card and the USB device share the IRQ 9.
System hangs during ethernet initialization.

Why? That was the whole point in my writing the patch in the first place - I 
got annoyed with it not powering down because it didn't try the APM 
power-down routine after acpi_power_off_handler() failed to do anything.

It tries ACPI first, but if it's still running after trying that, it reverts 
to the APM routine. What's wrong with that?

(Please Cc me your reply - I only happened to stumble across the list archive 
when I was trying to work out why it acpi_power_off_handler() doesn't succeed 
in powering off my Abit BP6 in the first place.

The fallback to APM poweroff may work on your
machine but I don't believe it is safe for
general use.  APM needs to be engaged before
doing any APM BIOS calls like poweroff and
that will conflict with ACPI being enabled.

'engaged'? I thought that all the setup code did was to get the entry point 
information and set up the segment tables accordingly - I didn't think it 
actually made a call into the APM BIOS to tell it that it was going to be used.

This is in SMP mode - smp-power-off only. I agree that full APM shouldn't be 
enabled at the same time as ACPI.

Looking at the APM code, it seems like it does.
&gt;From apm() apm_engage_power_management() is
called which makes a call into the BIOS.

&gt; This is in SMP mode - smp-power-off only. I agree
&gt; that full APM shouldn't be

I suspect engaging the APM BIOS even without
the separate step of enabling APM is going to
cause problems for ACPI.

&gt; &gt; If the ACPI user space tools (e.g. acpid) do
&gt; &gt; anything useful, it isn't documented.
&gt; 
&gt; acpid reads the ACPI tables and uploads important

ok, after a short search...where are the acpi tools?

i'm a wee bit nervous not having battery status on my laptop now :)

It's possible your GPE status register won't clear
and the ACPI driver is spinning waiting for it to
clear.  I can add a timeout to the next patch but
still you are going to see an awful performance
hit sharing between ACPI, with relatively slow
register accesses, and any high bandwidth device.

Sharing an interrupt between a net card and
USB controller (especially if UHCI) is
crazy much less also sharing with ACPI.

Why especially if UHCI? Why USB in general?

I share UHCI, Tulip and AIC7xxx all on one IRQ. I even developed the UHCI
driver on this configuration.

PCI was designed to do that.

OK, perhaps "crazy" was a overstatement.  My point
is that it's a bad idea to share interrupts between
high bandwidth devices and slower devices like
ACPI.

I took a closer look and, you are right, the
time required to determine that the UHCI card was
not the source of an interrupt is minimal.  I
suppose I was thinking of the amount of time
to find which TD completed.  My mistake.

The following patch is against 2.3.41-pre3

It begins the process of merging the ACPI and
APM driver interfaces.  If this looks acceptible,
I can submit a second patch doing the APM side of
the merge.

The only APM events that any driver is actually
handling are suspend and resume and
user/sys/critical are always handled as one.
So I believe I can safely map APM_XXX_SUSPEND to
PM_SUSPEND and APM_XXX_RESUME to PM_RESUME
and just discard all of the other APM events.
Or do you forsee the need to propagate any
additional APM events (eg. APM_LOW_BATTERY)?

Thanks,
Andy

&gt; &gt; shut down: I just suspect it should be handled by
&gt; &gt; a UPS-like notification rather than being part of
&gt; &gt; the driver power management thing (ie the APM
&gt; &gt; low-battery event should _not_ be considered to
&gt; &gt; be an event similar to a suspend or resume,
&gt; &gt; it should have a different interface altogether).
&gt; Right, device drivers should only need to know
&gt; the power state for their specific device(s) and
&gt; not need to know what the rest of the system
&gt; is doing.  Low battery can be handled at a higher
&gt; level (eg. by shutting down or suspending the
&gt; system which will result in individual device
&gt; suspends)
&gt; Driver isolation allows for centralized power
&gt; management policy and individual power management
&gt; of devices.
Hmm ... but what about actions that might the kernel take to save power?
Not that we actually know of those kinds of powersaving features in the
kernel's drivers yet but that may just be a matter of short time.
I could think of upcoming portable devices using Linux (transmeta's Crusoe
is for sure only the beginning) that could maybe out some parts of the
system in a more powersaving state like throttling CPU speed or the speed of
other devices/parts that then work at lower performance but give some more
battery life (for example monochrome LCDs couls be switched from many
graylevels to just some graylevels which saves power too).
Sure this could also be handled by a usermode daemon that could throttle
those things by ioctl()s or something. But I doubt that this is a good
choice for, let's say, chipset level functions.
I could think of something like /proc/acpi/warnlevel where a battery level
could be defined when the ACPI/APM driver will issue a "power critical"
signal to registered drivers.

Just an idea ;)

No.  If you take a look, the patch is not disabling
ACPI at all but helping Linux map the ACPI tables
on some AMI-based systems.

We are seeing some systems that have ACPI tables
in memory not reserved as ACPI table memory.  By
using trust-tables and copy-tables, we are telling
the ACPI driver that those tables really are there
(despite the ioremap failure) and just go ahead
and copy them out of the way (so that Linux doesn't
squash them).

It should be completely harmless.

The original problem was reported on an MSI6120
with AMI 1.9 BIOS but I suspect others will also
see this.  I do not have access to such a system
myself but it sounds like either the E820 BIOS
call is returning the wrong address map (perhaps
the ACPI tables are not marked as ACPI reserved)
or the Linux E820 code is not handling the
address map correctly.

The best AMI could do is verify that the address
map is generated correctly by E820 and then talk
to David Parsons (orc@pell.chi.il.us) and figure
out why his memory detection code is or is not
doing the right thing.

Thanks.  For vendors, being proactive is what is
going to assure that Linux runs best on your
BIOS, hardware, etc. first.

Hi!

&gt; If you get an E_TIME failure, increment a timeout value by some amount (up
&gt; to a max) and retry.  If it finally works, use that timeout from then on.

And how is it better than using bigger timeout, always?!

Hi!

&gt; While people seem to be hot on this subject, I would like a way to
&gt; conveniently (or otherwise) deactivate my screen as quickly as possible
&gt; and leave it off.  I have no need for the backlit display and would very
&gt; much like to conserve the battery life by not activating the light.  I
&gt; don't care if hte screen itself is on (unless operating it without the
&gt; light would physically hurt it) but I would like the option of turning off
&gt; the light.
&gt; 
&gt; How can I do this using ACPI?

I'd like to know, too. When using ACPI, I found no way to turn off the
screen.
								Pavel
PS: If screen does turn  off for you on blank, just setterm some
very short time before screenblank.

Hi!

&gt; &gt; I have tried from 4ms to 100ms. 10ms worked too and I have left this
&gt; &gt; version as my booting kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; The next release of the EC driver will default to 10ms (versus 2ms, or
&gt; originally 1ms).  Looking into making this dynamic, and/or command-line
&gt; configurable.

Why? Nothing is wrong with 10ms on good hardware, and if bad hardware needs
10msec, it just needs it. No need to configure anything.

Hi!

&gt; &gt; this is highly encouraged, but you have to provide one kernel config
&gt; &gt; that actually works on every machine (not optimized, but that works)
&gt; &gt; (sort of *BSD's GENERIC)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You need a working machine to compile your own kernel, don't you?
&gt; 
&gt; but you DON'T need a kernel with APM or ACPI to compile a new kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; *BSD GENERIC is designed to boot your machine so that you can compile a
&gt; new kernel. *all* linux distro kernels are designed to "just use our
&gt; kernel and dont bother compiling your own". That is definitely wrong.

Why? To get 5% speedup? Who cares about 5% on old machine acting as 
Xterminal?

   CCed to Andy because I don't know when phobos will be up again.


   1.) Happy new year

   2.) I've installed 2.3.35 without any patch.

   When I build the kernel with ACPI support and without APM support
   the power-button or shutdown -h now still don't power off nor blank
   my system (P3B-F and TX97-XE).

   During boot the P3B-F writes

   ACPI: "ASUS" found at 0x000f59c0

   and the TX97-XE

   ACPI: "ASUS" found at 0x000f7a20


   There is no /proc/apm available, neither before nor after loading
   acpid (as expected).


   3.) When I build the kernel with ACPI _and_ APM (only APM, no
   special function activated) support, the power button or shutdown
   -h now powers down the system!


  During boot the P3B-F writes

   ACPI: "ASUS" found at 0x000f59c0
   apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.11)

   and the TX97-XE

   ACPI: "ASUS" found at 0x000f7a20
   apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.11)



   But, there is a /proc/apm (and a /proc/sys/acpi/*) available.
   Before _and_ after loading acpid! I didn't expect that...



   
   echo "1" &gt;/proc/sys/acpi/sleep

   crashes the P3B-F (power button doesn't work to wake the system)
   and has no effekt on my TX97-XE (the screen blanks for about 1 s).



   conclusion: 2.3.35 has the same functionality as 2.3.25 had. -&gt; it
   works on my system (pressing the power button actually halts and
   powers down my system), but I guess that's a bug... isn't it?

Having just got back to uni I have tryed the latest acpi stuff on my ABIT
BH6, with the dodgy acpi implementation, anyway poweroff still, not
surprisingly, does not work, but now

echo 1 &gt; sleep

The screen blanks, not much else happens, the screen remains blanked until I
hit a key when it comes back on, is that what is suppossed to happen? (BTW
does acpid need to be running when you do this?)

Yes, I saw that patch.  I like the idea of unifying
some of the power off code but don't like the
dual ACPI/APM power off.  I also noticed that
Linus didn't end up including the patch in the
following kernel release.

Interesting.. As of 2.3.37, if ACPI is present,
APM should be disabled.  What does the kernel/boot

&gt; &gt; Why especially if UHCI? Why USB in general?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I share UHCI, Tulip and AIC7xxx all on one IRQ. I
&gt; &gt; even developed the UHCI
&gt; &gt; driver on this configuration.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; PCI was designed to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, perhaps "crazy" was a overstatement.  My point
&gt; is that it's a bad idea to share interrupts between
&gt; high bandwidth devices and slower devices like
&gt; ACPI.
&gt; 
&gt; I took a closer look and, you are right, the
&gt; time required to determine that the UHCI card was
&gt; not the source of an interrupt is minimal.  I
&gt; suppose I was thinking of the amount of time
&gt; to find which TD completed.  My mistake.

Yeah, UHCI just checks a register to see if it generated the IRQ. Checking
for the completed TD would take a while in some situations but we don't
do that anymore.

It's obviously better to not share IRQ's if you can, but this shouldn't
be causing the problems he's seeing.

apm_bios_init() doesn't get that far #ifdef CONFIG_SMP. It exits right after 
it finds the entry points. I'd not suggest that CONFIG_ACPI did anything 
different.

&gt; 
&gt; i'm a wee bit nervous not having battery status on

acpid is available from

 
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hardware/3165/

OK, there's clearly a need for an ACPI README or
FAQ here.  If anyone would like to contribute
one I'd be happy to have it.

&gt; You want to know the idle power saving difference

&gt; and control external variables like screen
&gt; brightness.  This would give you some idea of the
&gt; power savings difference between APM and ACPI when
&gt; your system is actually active.

I could do that more easily if I had access to the battery time that
apmd is able to display.  That gives some indication of power
consumption.  Is that information available through ACPI?

I suppose I could simply leave the system completely idle for the ~3.5
hours it takes to discharge when idle, from a full battery, and see when
it gives up.  I've only ever run out of juice once in real use, and that
involved a couple of hours downloading stuff over a network while
compiling kernels.  (These Toshibas are great :-)

I'd have to make it especially idle for a sensible test.  Mount all fses
read only, that sort of thing.  To make sure the disk can spin down.

APM knows to shut down shortly before the battery is exhausted.  If the
"give up" signal is routed through ACPI, that's not going to be such a
helpful comparison is it?

Running a non-idle test is much more difficult.  When I'm actually using
the computer, the battery life figures from apmd jump around by a factor
of two depending on what I've been doing in the last few minutes.

So sustaining comparable non-idle behaivour is going to be very
difficult.

Right, device drivers should only need to know
the power state for their specific device(s) and
not need to know what the rest of the system
is doing.  Low battery can be handled at a higher
level (eg. by shutting down or suspending the
system which will result in individual device
suspends)

Driver isolation allows for centralized power
management policy and individual power management
of devices.

Hi,

as you may have noticed, phobos was down the last two days. This was the result
of a combination of two bad things: A script kiddy tried to break in, and the
harddisk ran full. So I took the opportunity to do a complete reinstall.

The mail system is, as you can see, back up. The webserver is to follow today,
when I get access to the backups again (broken FDDI cable between us and the
ADSM server). FTP will need some time, as well as logins and CVS.

The only thing left for me to do is to apologize for the inconvenience.

&gt; 
&gt; That's because you've got ACPI enabled too.  ACPI

&gt; 
&gt; I don't know why it does that -- APM seems to work
&gt; fine with ACPI in earlier kernels, and now suspend
&gt; takes longer and the clock isn't restored properly
&gt; after a suspend.

APM is disabled by ACPI as both can not be enabled
at once.  On some platforms you can get away with
APM engaged (the most common reason is to compensate
for a non-working S5 implementation and fallback to
APM power off) but it's not safe to do. If you want
to use APM, turn off or disable (kernel command
line "acpi=off") ACPI.

&gt; The solution: turn off ACPI.  I can't see what the
&gt; point in using the ACPI support is at the moment. 

On systems with working ACPI implementations,
ACPI gets you CPU power states (saves power
when CPU is idle), S5 (soft off), and power/sleep
button support.  APM additionally provides suspend
and battery status and these features are
currently incomplete for ACPI but on the way.

&gt; If the ACPI user space tools (e.g. acpid) do
&gt; anything useful, it isn't documented.

acpid reads the ACPI tables and uploads important
information about how to do CPU power states,
S-states, and handles power/sleep button presses.
If acpid does not run, the ACPI driver won't
do much useful.

&gt; For me the only effect of acpid is to prevent
&gt; suspends from suspending at all.  Nothing useful
&gt; like battery life estimation, clock updating,
&gt; that sort of thing.

Battery support is coming.  It's a bit more
complicated to do than APM, hence the delay.
You have to have a completely working AML
interpreter and, for many systems, an
embedded controller driver.

&gt; A lot of work is obviously going into the kernel
&gt; ACPI driver.  Of course I'd like to minimise power
&gt; consumption on my laptop.  So I'm wondering, how
&gt; is that kernel driver getting tested? Is there a
&gt; user space tool I haven't found?

Most of the problems we are seeing are just
discovered by people running with ACPI on
various systems.  There is really no better
way to test things like C-states, S-states,
and buttons other than by hand.

Ok.  So I run acpid, and I get this:

	acpid: started
	acpid: FACP @ 0x03fe0054
	acpid: DSDT @ 0x03fe00c8
	acpid: S0 SLP_TYP (0x0500)

	acpid: S3 SLP_TYP (0x0700)
	acpid: S4 SLP_TYP (0x0000)
	acpid: S5 SLP_TYP (0x0700)

Prior to starting acpid, when APM is disabled by ACPI, the laptop does
suspend after 5 seconds or so of beeping).  (In earlier kernels where
APM is not disabled, the laptop suspends immediately and apmd can
restore the clock).

The only visible effect is that the laptop won't suspend any more.
Something obviously got set because when acpid is killed, the laptop
still doesn't suspend.

I didn't find any acpid documentation so if it's doing anything else, I
don't know about it.

My question is: is there any advantage for me in enabling ACPI in the kernel,

than when it's using APM?

Right, APM is not being engaged when it is

suspend to work at all.  Further, once acpid
is started, ACPI is enabled in the BIOS.  After
that any attempt to use APM features is going

Depends on how good of an APM/ACPI implementation
you have.  ACPI C-states definitely save power
and most ACPI laptops support at least C1 and C2
(C3 is the deepest processor power state).  Some
APM implementations allow the CPU to be slowed.

I don't know what the actual power savings of
C-states vs. APM CPU slowing are on your system.
It might be interesting to test it out and see
which causes your battery to last longer.

Ah, but it does.  With older kernels it's immediate because of course
APM is enabled.  With newer kernels, when I close the lid the laptop
beeps as it does for a suspend, but carries on beeping for about 5
seconds.  I presume it's waiting for the all-clear from the kernel which
it doesn't get.  Then it suspends anyway.

The clock is screwed of course because apmd is not there to restore it
later.

What's interesting is that after running acpid, the laptop doesn't do
that any more.  Closing the lid makes it beep once and not try to shut
down.  That corresponds to the "don't shut down when I close the lid"
mode that is settable via the keyboard.  Trying to change back to the
"do shut down" mode using the keyboard doesn't work.

&gt; Further, once acpid
&gt; is started, ACPI is enabled in the BIOS.  After
&gt; that any attempt to use APM features is going

Ah, it calls the BIOS.  No wonder the default APM facilities are
deactivated.

That's not really informative because power consumption varies so much
with what the computer's doing.  The estimates from apmd vary by a
factor of two depending on how bright the screen is, whether I dragged a
window recently, whether the disk is spun down, that sort of thing.
(I'm not quite sure why the disk ever spins down, what with atimes and
cron, but mysteriously it does ever so occasionally).

According to the spec, it is possible to go back to legacy mode, if the
system supports legacy at all. If you'd initialize and engage APM after
disabling ACPI, it should work, at least theoretically... :-)

Yup.  acpid running causes ACPI mode to be entered.
ACPI events are routed through the ACPI system
control interrupt (eg. power button presses get
sent to the ACPI driver instead of being handled
directly by the system)  This also stops APM
features from working.

You want to know the idle power saving difference

Right, you can turn off ACPI and return to legacy
mode.  Unfortunately, I've encountered systems that
are completely broken for ACPI disable.  The lack
of testing for this feature is somewhat understandable
as most times the operating system turns on ACPI and
leaves it on through power off.

Right now, I don't believe the LOW_BATTERY etc more esoteric events are

Glad to hear it's mostly working. I should mention that we have not been

have taken higher priority, and probably will continue to do so in the next

Didn't want anyone to have unrealistic expectations, but I'm glad to hear

&gt; Current ACPI works ok:

&gt; - Sleep mode worked after bootup (battery full, on-line).
&gt; - After pulling the power plug sleep mode no longer worked (wakes up
&gt; immedeately)
&gt; - When i turn on power supply it does not work again
&gt; - even when the battery is fully charged again sleep does not work any

Motherboard is:

WITH INTERPRETER:

Kernel just says:

ACPI: found "Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI" at 0x4f00

ACPI:         -0550: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Success: Entire namespace and objects deleted

And I get no /proc/sys/acpi :-(

Well, I'm really interesting in making this work, and I'd like to help, I
have helped with other drivers, so, well, if there is anything I can do,
just tell me!

Folks,
I've got an HP Omnibook 2100 with 2.4.0-test9-pre7 running on it.  ACPI
works fine for sleeping/restarting the computer but it doesn't see my
battery at all.  I have a great deal of programing experience but I've
never really dealt with ACIPI before can someone give me some pointers to
where I might start debugging this problem?  (the battery is recognized by
apmd.)

Thanks
Brendan

This will be posted tonight 6pm PST at
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm

Linux-specific changes:
- Power-off should work on more systems.
- User-mode ACPI support has been removed.
- ACPI chipset support has been removed.
- Better boot messages.

The configuration changes will also require an additional patch, which will
also be on the website.

(I'm thinking of releasing all the Linux stuff in patch form only in the
future. Should work better. Sound ok?)

Core changes:
ACPI 2.0 table support with backwards support for ACPI 1.0 and the 0.71
extensions.  Note: although we can read ACPI 2.0 BIOS tables, the AML 
interpreter does NOT have support for the new 2.0 ASL grammar terms
at this time.

All ACPI hardware access is via the GAS structures in the ACPI 2.0 FADT.  

All physical memory addresses across all platforms are now 64 bits wide.
Logical address width remains dependent on the platform (i.e., "void *").

AcpiOsMapMemory interface changed to a 64-bit physical address.

The AML interpreter integer size is now 64 bits, as per the ACPI 2.0
specification.

For backwards compatibility with ACPI 1.0, ACPI tables with a revision
number
less than 2 use 32-bit integers only.

Fixed a problem where the evaluation of OpRegion operands did not always
resolve them to numbers properly.

It hasn't appeared on the page yet, but I got file:

  acpica-linux-debug-20001115.tar.gz

from the ftp directory the page points to.  However,
it doesn't work for me... the kernel fails to links with:

  drivers/acpi/acpi.o(.text+0x28ad1): undefined reference to `acpi_get_rsdp_ptr'

grepping through the source I don't find any definition of
this, just a call in driver.c.

Hi Jack,
 
This is an issue with the code, not your BIOS. That line appears to be
extraneous, and we can probably just remove it. ;-)

This will be posted Monday 6pm PST at
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
(Sorry for the delay in posting, but I wanted to send this notice today
regardless)

Linux-specific changes:
--------------------
None

Core changes:
--------------------
Fixed a problem where method invocations within the ASL definition of
both OperationRegions and CreateXXXFields did not work properly.  The
symptom was an AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE during initialization of the
region/field:

  nsinit-0209: AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE while getting region arguments [DEBG]
  ammonad-0284: Exec_monadic2_r/Not: bad operand(s) (0x3005)

Fixed a problem where operators with more than one nested subexpression
would fail.  The symptoms were varied, by mostly AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE
errors.  This was actually a rather serious problem that has gone
unnoticed until now.

  Subtract (Add (1,2), Multiply (3,4))

Fixed a problem where AcpiGetHandle didn't quite get fixed in the previous
build (The prefix part of a relative path was handled incorrectly).

Fixed a problem where Operation Region initialization failed if the
operation region name was a "namepath" instead of a simple "nameseg".
Symptom was an AE_NO_OPERAND error.

Fixed a problem where an assignment to a local variable via the indirect
RefOf mechanism only worked for the first such assignment.  Subsequent
assignments were ignored.

Fixed redundant address handler init resulting in AE_EXIST message (7).

Outstanding issues:
--------------------
Shutdown still doesn't work for everyone.
Potential race because of sleep_on()
oops in ns_get_parent_object()
System sluggish due to an acpi_idle issue?

What about ToBCD op definition range?(Currently 0-9999)
For 16bit systems? I don't think it is not written explicitly
in the spec. At least my machine do not work unless it is more tolerant.
In my machine, the operation is used to convert Battery S/N , written 
in integer, to string and store in _BIF.

I'll fix yours if you fix mine :)

My system no longer manages to load the ACPI namespace:

ACPI: System description tables found
    ACPI-0415: *** Warning: Reference \_PR_.CPU0 AML 7B4 not found
    ACPI-0092: *** Error: Acpi_load_tables: Could not load namespace: AE_NOT_FOUND
    ACPI-0101: *** Error: Acpi_load_tables: Could not load tables: AE_NOT_FOUND
ACPI: System description table load failed

The warning about \_PR_.CPU0 was there before. Not the subsequent errors
though. This is an Abit BP6 with RU BIOS - I've posted DSDT dump before
but it's also at http://www.infradead.org/~dwmw2/dsdtdisasm-bp6-rubios.gz

Thanks for your fix. I tried your previous patch, and the event generated by
a power button press no longer showed up, but I'll give this one a shot.

Are you using the debug version? That might provide some more info.

The AE_NOT_FOUND looks like the same issue Brendan Burns reported. BTW, can
you send me your binary DSDT? (I think the utilities will do it, or cat
/proc/sys/acpi/dsdt to a file.)*

Regards -- Andy

ps If you or anyone else wanted to implement the stubbed-out semaphore
functions in os.c, that would also be really helpful. Note that we need a
wait_semaphore that takes a timeout. ;-))

* Why do I keep asking people for this? Because we have a Windows utility
(AcpiExec) that runs against an extracted DSDT and catches pure interpreter
errors in a more-debuggable environment. It's part of the Windows source
drop, btw.

/proc/sys/acpi doesn't exist. Is this because it failed to load the
namespace? If so, that's a little suboptimal. I'll revert to an earlier
kernel and take a copy.

Hmmm. I reckon we have about a whelk's chance in a supernova of getting a
'real' down_timeout() into 2.4 at this stage. I'll poke that that later
and see if we can fake it.

Ok, your BIOS reports the mobo as capable of having 2 processors, named CPU_
and CPU1. (Note that both of these are always there, even if only one cpu is
installed.)

Method \_TZ.THRM._PSL references the nonexistent CPU0, and ACPI fails to
load as a result. I was wrong, this is not the same problem Brendan Burns
was having - the AE_NOT_FOUNDs stem from CPU0 not being found, not any sort
of PCI Config problem.

This would be an easy one for a BIOS engineer at Abit to fix. My first
thought would be to contact Abit (technical@abit-usa.com ?) and that would
probably be better coming from the person who actually bought it. ;-)

Hi,

I've recently been trying to get ACPI working again on my ASUS K7M based 
Athlon system. In the past I have had the no-AML interpreter version working 
with acpid-052200 on 2.4.0-test5 to the extent that the system would power 
itself off on shutdown. I never tested the S1 functionality at that time.

Having installed acpid-071100 I enabled the AML interpreter in 2.4.0-test11, 
installed the new kernel and found that ACPI was not detected (no 
/proc/sys/acpi, acpid reports no ACPI found). After reading the mailing list 
archive I found out about the latest releases, and downloaded 
acpica-linux-debug-20001115.tar.gz and acpi.diff. I replaced 
linux/drivers/acpi as instructed and attempted to apply acpi.diff, which 
failed 1 of 3 hunks. Inspection revealed the patch to 
linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c had failed, so I applied the patch by hand. 
I've included this hacked up file (so it can be verified for correctness) at 
the end of this mail. I also needed to modify line 31 of 
/usr/include/linux/acpi.h to read

__u64 acpi_get_rsdp_ptr(void);

instead of

u64 acpi_get_rsdp_ptr(void);

in order to get acpid to compile.

Here are the ACPI related messages I now receive from the kernel:

Hi All,

I've just reflashed my BIOS with the latest from ASUS (km1009.bin) to no 
avail - ACPI fails in exactly the same fashion as reported yesterday. I have, 
however, found something more interesting :-)

I vaguely remember having seen 'ACPI: Sx supported' type messages from the 
kernel in the past, and I know from inspection of the source that only the 
AML-interpreter version generates such strings. I decided to go back to an 
early testXX kernel to see if I could find a working version.

I picked test5, and compiled it with exactly the same settings as I'm using 
with test11+acpica-linux-debug-20001115. Well, almost - normally I compile 
AGP support directly into the kernel, but if I do this with test5 it oopses 
trying to initialise AGP. Booting this kernel results in working ACPI, 
replete with 'ACPI: Sx supported' type messages.

I then tried test7, which failed:

ACPI: support found
ACPI: namespace load failed
ACPI:         -0550: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Success: Entire namespace and objects 
deleted

I then tried test6, which failed:

ACPI: support found
ACPI:         -0531: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Error: Ns_search_and_enter: bad parameter
ACPI: namespace load failed
ACPI:         -0550: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Success: Entire namespace and objects 
deleted

Then I realised that I hadn't disabled AGP when compiling 6 &amp; 7 as I had done 
for 5. To make sure, I recompiled test6 with AGP disabled:

ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0x0810:6
ACPI: S1 supported
ACPI: S5 supported                                                            
 
Oh, that's interesting - it works fine with AGP disabled! The next thing I 
tried was test11+acpica-linux-debug-20001115 without AGP:

ACPI Subsystem version [Dec  3 2000]

ACPI: Subsystem enable failed                                                 

It still fails, but it gets a lot further along in the process. Is the kernel 
AGP initialisation clobbering the ACPI tables in memory ?

What I'll probably try next is to compile successive kernels without AGP 
support starting with test7 and find the point where it breaks.

Cheers,

Adam.

I have a question regarding CPU throttling on the Athlon.

I want buy a new Motherboard and wanted to know whether the CPU
throttling on the Athlon depends on the BIOS or just the chip set.

My understanding is that the Siemens Motherboards (Intel though) have a
microcontroller onboard that implements the thermal/noise strategy OS
independant. Shouldn't this be done by the OS (Linux in my case)?

Any sugggestions?

best regards,
 florian nierhaus

P.S.
I am aware that CPU throttling is not supported by ACPI yet...

Folks,
after compiling the latest ACPI version on my Omnibook 2100 (PIIX4)

ACPI enable fails with the following:
ACPI Subsystem version [Dec  4 2000]
ACPI: System description tables found
 tbxface-0089: ACPI Tables successfully loaded

ACPI: System description tables loaded

After a little investigation I see that the parse walk through the tree on
PCI enabling is succeding but the second parse walk (the one that leads to
execution fails with the error AE_NO_EXIST (error #6)  Anyone have any
ideas what might be causing this?

Thanks

No, the current ACPI drivers haven't been backported, and it is neither
planned nor possible, since the drivers rely on the new power management
interface introduced in 2.4 and also all drivers being ported to this
interface.

Power-down should also work with APM on SMP boxen by activating APM just
before shutdown. I don't recall since what version this is in the kernel,
but it might be worth looking at.

Hi. I want to install Linux on my laptop (acer 506T) and I want to know if
I have to install it with the ACPI in the kernel enabled, or can I stop
worrying about it? I am not really concerned about how much power I consume.
All I am worried about is that without ACPI the laptop fan won't turn on
anymore and something will burn as a result. Previously I tried to install
linux side-by-side with WIN98 and I damaged my harddisk because WIN98 does its
own power managment (similar to acpi I suppose) and it writes stuff to the
linux partition without warning. Now I replaced my disk and I want to redo
the whole thing (minus disk damage of course, GRRRR! Thanks MS!!) and I just
want to make sure I don't do anything wrong. Can someone help me?

Thanks

Hi there i run 2.4.0-test11 on slackware.
When i run 'init 0' the machine hangs after the shutdown script finnish
with the message "ACPI: S5 faild".
The shutdown script contains:
    killall5 -15
    sleep 5
    killall5 -9

If i delete these lines the computer halt as it should but the root
partition will not be unmounted because processes are still accessing 
the disc and i will have a fsck on boot.

The problem is that 'killall5' kills [acpi] and acpid.
acpid can i restart after the partition is remounted ro but i cant restart [acpi].
Isn't [acpi] supose to ignore these signals?
If you have a smarter shutdown script that dosn't kill [acpi] cold you
please mail it to me?

Hi,

I wanted to #define this for a new architecture with some unique
devices. But I want to do it in a way that won't conflict with your
future plans.

I thought the most straightforward way would be to add an #include
&lt;asm/pm.h&gt; to linux/pm.h. This would require all the asm-*/ dirs to have
at least an empty pm.h.

Is this what you had in mind for doing once the need arose?

Thanks,

The ACPI spec describes this for you, though I wouldn't recommend that
document for anyone that is not a masochist.

So, I will give you the 30-second run down.  Note that this is
ACPI-specific.

When awaking from S2 or S3, all processor context is lost, so it starts
from the reset vector.  The BIOS starts executing and somewhere along the
way, it checks the value of the Firmware Waking Vector in the Firmware
ACPI Control Structure.  If that value is non-zero, it assumes that it
contains an address and jumps to it.

And that's it for the BIOS.  Well, what is that magical address you ask?

Well, that's the wakeup routine that the OS has installed to bring the
rest of the system back up.  The OS is responsible for setting that
magical address value before it goes to sleep.  The routine itself is
kindy nasty because when you come back, you are in Real Mode and all
processor state is lost, so you have to make the switch to Protected Mode,
restore all of the state, then go through and restore all device state
(since every device lost power when going to sleep).  The initial routine
of course doesn't have to do all this, but in order to support those sleep
states, all aspects have to be accounted for, and none of them are
non-trivial.  Which is also why you didn't find any note of them in those
files - no one has implemented them for Linux.  Well, at least finished
them.  I have been working on the wakeup routine and the kernel support
for it.  If anyone else has put time into this, maybe we can swap notes
and get this thing finished.

Also, someone should do an ACPI Spec -&gt; English Translation for the
Documentation directory.  :-)

Does that answer your question?

Ok.
But what makes it decide to wake up from S2 or S3?
Say the system is in one of these states and (I'm guessing here) the CPU is
halted (whatever that means -- probably depends on the CPU). Then I push a
wakeup button. What happens next? Which part of the system gets the signal?
How does it know what to do with it up to the point where it gets the next
CPU address from the Waking Vector? What decides which actions can wake the
system up?
If BIOS firmware is responsible for handling wakeup until we start running
the OS-registered wakeup handler, then is the CPU running the BIOS firmware?
If so, what woke it up and told it to start running the BIOS firmware?

&gt; Does that answer your question?

That helps. It sounds like basically just another interrupt service routine
(but a complicated one). And the standard interrupt vector I take it is
different from the Firmware Waking Vector.

Thanks for your answer

	Although the stock linux-2.4.0-test13pre3 does not allow
one to build the acpi interpreter as a loadable module, I had
tweaked the Makefiles in previous kernels to do this (the supporting
code is there and it seemed to work, at least for shutting off the
power after a shutdown).  Unfortunately, in 2.4.0-test13pre3, this
is no harder to do, because there is a circular dependency:

drivers/acpi/ references acpi_get_rsdp_ptr in arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c,
				and
arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c references acp_find_root_pointer in drivers/acpi/.


	I would like to recommend that the contents of
arch/i{386,a64}/kernel/acpi.c be merged back somewhere in drivers/acpi/,
and just selected with Makefile options, ifdefs, or perhaps runtime
options (if the ia64 code is potentionally useable to an i386 kernel
that find itself running on an ia64 CPU, which will probably be the case
with most Linux distributions initially installed on ia64 hardware).

	If need be, I would be willing to at least write a quick and
dirty #ifdef-based version of this proposed change.

Good call.

Truning off ACPI support fixes the problem.

Hi Knut, everyone,

&gt; I luckily own a sony vaio z700tek since a short time and tried to get it to
&gt; work with acpi. I already tried kernel 2.4.0-test12 which booted but did not
&gt; work out when trying to send it in sleep mode. So I patched it with the
&gt; intel patch from 12/15/2000 - since then I am not actually able to boot the
&gt; vaio with acpi enabled. It always locks after loading the system tables. A
&gt; little debugging showed that it does not return from calling the user
&gt; function on level 5 in _ns_walks_namespace.

Like on my vaio z505ls it is probably stuck executing the _STA method of
the _SB_PCI0ISA_EC0_BAT1 device.

I've modified the code to skip execution of this method and a few others
which also hang. See patch below. It is by no means a proper fix, just a
quick hack to let the system boot. Please try it on your system and let 
me know the results.

Can anyone tell us exactly why BAT1's _STA doesn't work?

The disassembler's output of this method definitely looks weird:

00001bf2:           Method _STA (\_SB_.PCI0.ISA_.EC0_.BAT1._STA)
00001bf8:             ArgCount 0; NotSerialized
00001bf9:             And
00001bfa:               &lt;NULL&gt;
00001bfe:               0xdb
00001c00:               0x80
00001c02:             0x0100
00001c05:             Local1

Perhaps it uses opcodes not supported by the current Linux ACPI 
implementation??

I've appended BAT1 sections of both raw acpidmp and "acpidmp DSDT |
acpidisasm" output below. Complete dumps available upon request.

&gt; 
&gt; I tried as well to user test13-pre3 with the latest patch (12/20/2000)
&gt; from Andrew Grover
&gt; but could not extract the patch from the archives (coudl someone maybe
&gt; mail it to me?) and the unpatched kernel seems to be the same as test12
&gt; patched with the mentioned patch from 12/15/2000 - at least it locked up a
&gt; the same point.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to mention that lock up means that the kernel does not lock the hard
&gt; way since the vaio is still soft-resetable.
&gt; 
&gt; Um, and yes, the hardware: z600tek is a european edition - its a pentium III
&gt; - 700 with phoenix bios 4.0 rev 6 and intel chipset.
&gt; 
&gt; I would gladly joing in and help on development if someone could point me to
&gt; where to look for the problem...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance

Greets,

Please advise: for which versions of 2.4testXX-preYY kernel tree is the
Intel ACPI code compilable/valid?  

Thanks,

Jerritt Collord

The patch should apply cleanly (or with a few offset patches) to test12, as
well as test12-pre3 and above

Are you running into difficulty?

I had trouble compiling the test12 kernel after the ACPI-CA patch, but no
problem with the test12-pre3.  

For the record, following are the debug statements that were the result of
booting this kernel on my Micron Trek2 (PII, 440BX/PIIX4E) laptop:

Can you post your DSDT? The PMTools utility acpidmp should work for this.

(I think your system has the "implicit return" problem, but I can't say for
sure without the DSDT)

&gt; 

I can reproduce it 100% too, although I think it's different from
Jens' problem - he says his machine doesn't support ACPI.  I'm afraid
I haven't had a lot of time to do investigative work.

I can confirm that it started happening when the large ACPI patch went
in a week or two ago.  I specifically backed out that part of Linus'
patch and the problem went away.  When I disable ACPI in config it goes
away.

Tha machine is a recent Dell Latitude.  The bridge is a TI1131.  The symptoms
are when the kernel is booted with the 3CCFE575CT Cardbus NIC in its slot
it is not initialised correctly.  If the NIC ispluged in *after* booting it's
fine.  If the NIC is unplugged and replugged it's fine.  It's just that
first boot.

Here is some dmesg output.  The important part is the "cs:
cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0xffff, device 0xffff".  That's where
things start to go wrong.

I'm thinking arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c should just go away, yes?

Its purpose is probably better served by an ifdef, like you mentioned.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Although the stock linux-2.4.0-test13pre3 does not allow
&gt; one to build the acpi interpreter as a loadable module, I had
&gt; tweaked the Makefiles in previous kernels to do this (the supporting
&gt; code is there and it seemed to work, at least for shutting off the
&gt; power after a shutdown).  Unfortunately, in 2.4.0-test13pre3, this
&gt; is no harder to do, because there is a circular dependency:
&gt; 
&gt; drivers/acpi/ references acpi_get_rsdp_ptr in arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c,
&gt; 				and
&gt; arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c references acp_find_root_pointer in 
&gt; drivers/acpi/.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	I would like to recommend that the contents of
&gt; arch/i{386,a64}/kernel/acpi.c be merged back somewhere in 
&gt; drivers/acpi/,
&gt; and just selected with Makefile options, ifdefs, or perhaps runtime
&gt; options (if the ia64 code is potentionally useable to an i386 kernel
&gt; that find itself running on an ia64 CPU, which will probably 
&gt; be the case
&gt; with most Linux distributions initially installed on ia64 hardware).
&gt; 
&gt; 	If need be, I would be willing to at least write a quick and
&gt; dirty #ifdef-based version of this proposed change.

This looks like you have bad tables, from the BIOS.

Do you have the latest BIOS for this machine?

Could you capture your system's ACPI tables, and send them? I don't think
I've seen this particular error before, and I'd be very interested to see
the data we're parsing. (the acpidmp utility in the PMTools package should
capture them, even if the ACPI driver can't load:

I will try to answer some of these questions.
Guy

-&gt; The ACPI spec describes this for you, though I wouldn't recommend that
-&gt; document for anyone that is not a masochist.
-
-The next time I feel like punishing myself I'll look into it. Thanks.

I spent a lot of time trying to make the spec more readable in 2.0. The 1.0
spec had for the most part an author per chapter so there were problems with
redundancy, inconsistent nomenclature and frankly ordering. I couldn't read
it either so while it's nowhere near perfect.... 2.0 should be much better -
try it.


-Ok.
-But what makes it decide to wake up from S2 or S3?
-Say the system is in one of these states and (I'm guessing here) the CPU is
-halted (whatever that means -- probably depends on the CPU). Then I push a
-wakeup button. What happens next? Which part of the system gets the signal?
-How does it know what to do with it up to the point where it gets the next
-CPU address from the Waking Vector? What decides which actions can wake the
-system up?

ACPI compatible hardware contains "wake logic" as defined by the acpi spec.
ACPI compatible wake capable and enabled devices assert a signal when a wake
event occurs (see ACPI 2.0 section 4.7.2.3). This signal is enabled for
propagation through to the wake logic by writing an acpi specified register
- either a bit in the PM1 Enable (for RTC wake up) or a GPE enable bit (see
ACPI 2.0 section 4.7.4.1.1.1) as specified by _PRW for generic hardware.

A wake event sets the wake status bit in the PM1status register (bit 15).
This is done BY HARDWARE as a direct result of the wake event and causes the
system to transition back into the S0 state. In wake from S1, the chipset
starts clocking the cpu again and the cpu continues from the previous
instruction. In s2-s4, the CPU is reset and the BIOS executes - checking the
firmware waking vector as described and then jumps to that vector.


-If BIOS firmware is responsible for handling wakeup until we start running
-the OS-registered wakeup handler, then is the CPU running the BIOS
firmware?

yes, from the rest vector on S2-S4 but not from S1

-If so, what woke it up and told it to start running the BIOS firmware?

The system's wake logic as described above.


-That helps. It sounds like basically just another interrupt service routine
-(but a complicated one). And the standard interrupt vector I take it is
-different from the Firmware Waking Vector.

The most important thing to remember is that Wake and Interrupt are
completely separate and different. The wake logic causes the chipset to
transition the system back into S0 and this includes allowing the CPU to
resume the execution of instructions either from the reset vector or at the
next instruction after the sleep enable bit write.

&gt; From: Gordon McNutt [mailto:gmcnutt@ridgerun.com]
&gt; I wanted to #define this for a new architecture with some unique
&gt; devices. But I want to do it in a way that won't conflict with your
&gt; future plans.

Can you elaborate on this a little?

&gt; I thought the most straightforward way would be to add an #include
&gt; &lt;asm/pm.h&gt; to linux/pm.h. This would require all the asm-*/ 
&gt; dirs to have
&gt; at least an empty pm.h.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this what you had in mind for doing once the need arose?

Well, it sounds like what you're saying would break every arch's builds. If
this is the case you probably want to mention it on linux-kernel and/or
email the arch maintainers.

&gt; &gt; I wanted to #define this for a new architecture with some unique

&gt; &gt; future plans.
&gt;
&gt; Can you elaborate on this a little?
&gt;

I can elaborate a lot.

We're porting Linux to a CPU intended for embedded apps. This CPU has a
feature where you can turn the clock off to unused devices for conserving
power. Things like the UART's, for example. The hardware for these devices is
integrated into the chip so they are quite specific to the CPU.

Although we don't know if vendors will be implementing the hardware registers
necessary for ACPI compliance, I thought we could at least provide a default
power management module which implemented the Linux kernel ACPI interface and
used the PM features provided by the CPU. No, this would not be ACPI
compliant, and we wouldn't try to advertise it as such. But it would be nice
to give people something, and if we stick to the ACPI interface then if
vendors do provide the hardware they could use the ACPI module in place of
ours and not break any drivers, etc.

Does this make sense? Anyway, it's simple enough to do. I just have three
things things where I want to be careful so that our module is compatible with
the future direction of ACPI.

1. I need to have pm_access and pm_dev_idle actually _do_ something. Since
what they will be doing is very CPU-specific (namely, writing to a register to
shutdown or turn on a clock) I need to define them in arch-specific code, not
in linux/pm.h.

2. I need to be able to identify the devices which this CPU can turn off.
That's where PM_SYS_ARCH_SPECIFIC seemed to make sense.

3. I may need to change the way some of the standard drivers use pm_access &amp;
pm_dev_idle. For example, it isn't enough for the serial driver to call
pm_access only when accessing the registers. Instead, it needs to call it for
the duration that someone has the driver open, during which time the user
might be expecting data to come in on the line. But perhaps this puts a
different interpretation on pm_access. My thinking is, if a driver isn't in
the pm_access state, then the hardware can get turned off. Maybe this wasn't
the original intention behind this call?

&gt; Well, it sounds like what you're saying would break every arch's builds. If
&gt; this is the case you probably want to mention it on linux-kernel and/or
&gt; email the arch maintainers.
&gt;

The patch would probably just add 0 byte or semantically empty versions of
pm.h to all the other arch's. That way they still build.

&gt;

This looks interesting to me. I am trying to figure out how to do the 
power management on the StrongArm 1100. So basically I need to do the 
same thing that you are planning to do. Like you, I was hoping to use 
some of the kernel's ACPI abilities.

May I ask which processor you are working on?

ACPI and OS power management (OSPM) are not the same thing. Please realize
that ACPI is an *interface* -- it's a mechanism for OSPM to do things.
Neither the hardware nor the software parts of this interface are small. Do
you really want to add another 140K to the kernel running on your embedded
processor?

&gt; 1. I need to have pm_access and pm_dev_idle actually _do_

&gt; to a register to
&gt; shutdown or turn on a clock) I need to define them in 
&gt; arch-specific code, not
&gt; in linux/pm.h.

As far as I can tell, the purpose of pm_access and pm_dev_idle are for the
driver to tell OSPM when it is busy or not, so that OSPM can then optionally
turn around and ask the driver to turn off the device via pm_send, if some
idle threshold has been hit. Linux OSPM doesn't ever do this right now.
Regardless, the code to turn off a device should be in that device's driver,
yes?

You mention below that this type of idle detection is not suitable for
devices such as UARTs that need to remain on when opened. I agree. In the
case of "turn me on when opened, turn me off when closed" the device driver
knows both *when* to perform the power management, and how, so a more
system-wide PM framework may not be needed. Hmm, what do you think?

&gt; 3. I may need to change the way some of the standard drivers

&gt; Maybe this wasn't
&gt; the original intention behind this call?

Hmm. If I'm right about what I said above, the serial driver should not be
calling pm_access, as timer-based idle detection is not appropriate for
serial devices.

&gt; I'd like to hear more about this, if you or anyone else have 
&gt; any thoughts on the best direction to take.

1. The OS needs to be able to notify any device it needs to turn off
(Reason: suspend)
2. The driver needs to be able to turn itself off when not in use (Reason:
power savings)
3. The OS needs to be able to override a device's transition request
(Reason: other devices may rely on the device. Only the OS knows this.)
4. Drivers should both have the chance to be responsible for their own idle
detection, or allow the OS to do timer-based idle detection, or not ever
power down in S0. (Reason: different devices have different requirements.)

AFAIK the current PM architecture does #1, with some hooks to do the second
part of #4, and doesn't preclude #2.

I suspect the way to do it is to have a state machine handled in kernel 
space, with an API for that state machine to be uploaded by a userspace 
program.

What if the hardware to turn off a device is not part of that device's
hardware? For example, should the standard serial.c know how to access an
architecture-specific register to unclock the UART? A register which is not
part of the UART? Perhaps serial.c should know how to invoke an
architecture-independent interface to turn off the hardware, but it probably
doesn't need to know how that interface is implemented.

But I do agree now that pm_access() is not meant for this. It probably is meant
to inform the PM module that it needs the hardware to be up. And the purpose of
pm_dev_idle is probably just to inform the PM module that it can turn off the
hardware if it wants to. Currently nobody seems to use it, though.

&gt;

Although I did not agree that it knows *how* (at least not the details -- it
might know how to tell something else to do it, though), I would agree that it
does know *when*, except that your point #3 below is a good one. The OS may
know when it is *not* a good idea, even if the driver wants to. This argues in
favor of letting a driver request the OSPM module to turn off the hardware,
rather than having the driver do it by itself.

So in this case, the driver decides "now is a good time to turn hardware off --
I don't need it, anyway" and asks the OSPM module to turn it off. This module,
wether it be ACPI or whatever, can either disagree and not turn hardware off,
or it can agree and invoke the arch-specific routines to do so.

The scenario works for turning hardware back on, also.

&gt; 1. The OS needs to be able to notify any device it needs to turn off
&gt; (Reason: suspend)
&gt; 2. The driver needs to be able to turn itself off when not in use (Reason:
&gt; power savings)
&gt; 3. The OS needs to be able to override a device's transition request
&gt; (Reason: other devices may rely on the device. Only the OS knows this.)
&gt; 4. Drivers should both have the chance to be responsible for their own idle
&gt; detection, or allow the OS to do timer-based idle detection, or not ever
&gt; power down in S0. (Reason: different devices have different requirements.)
&gt;

These are good points. I think my ideas cover #1 - #3. Now, what about that
last part of #4? This seems to imply that both the driver and the OSPM module
need to concur on when to turn off the hardware. And I guess it doesn't really
matter which one makes the arch-specific call to actually turn things off, but
whoever does it must get the consent of the other first in order to satisfy all
requirements.

And since the ability to turn off a device's hardware will really end up being
arch-specific, with many archs not being able to do it for many devices, it
seems like it would clutter the driver's less if the only interface they had to
deal with was OSPM. And then the OSPM impl could handle the arch-specific
stuff.

At least, for the arch I'm looking at, this is the case. Perhaps in the future
it will be more common for device hardware to have the means to turn itself
off. But probably for a while it will be easier for OEM's to use standard
hardware with an external clock gate, and this seems very platform-specific.

Any comments?

Well, I took a look at Linux's serial driver code. It appears there are two
options. Option one is, if your hardware is kind-of like a standard serial
port, is to special-case your code in the main serial.c. Option 2 appears to
be splitting your special serial driver out into a separate driver, as the
author of the StrongArm-110 21285 serial driver did. Would either of these
be an option?

[snip]

&gt; These are good points. I think my ideas cover #1 - #3. Now,

I think you're close in assuming turning things on and off, but I think it's
more accurate to say it's *bus-specific*. For example, the USB or PCI specs
define powering off devices on their interface. ACPI can be thought of as
providing a PnP bus for all devices that don't have one - namely motherboard
devices. For a motherboard device, the OEM implements _PSx methods for it,
and then running these controls the device's power state.

&gt; And since the ability to turn off a device's hardware will 
&gt; really end up being
&gt; arch-specific, with many archs not being able to do it for 
&gt; many devices, it
&gt; seems like it would clutter the driver's less if the only 
&gt; interface they had to
&gt; deal with was OSPM. And then the OSPM impl could handle the 
&gt; arch-specific
&gt; stuff.

This is exactly right. However, we don't want to have to re-write OSPM for
each platform. So, ACPI is designed to abstract the platform-specific stuff
into control methods, which in turn do the dirty work, when called by OSPM.

&gt; At least, for the arch I'm looking at, this is the case. 
&gt; Perhaps in the future
&gt; it will be more common for device hardware to have the means 
&gt; to turn itself
&gt; off. But probably for a while it will be easier for OEM's to 
&gt; use standard
&gt; hardware with an external clock gate, and this seems very 
&gt; platform-specific.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments?

As I've tried to describe above, ACPI was implemented to solve this problem,
but it won't solve it today, and it wasn't designed to solve it on embedded
devices (so its size may be prohibitive). That's why my first thought was to
hack up the serial driver in the meantime. ;-)

Hi Simon!

&gt; &gt; I would like to know if there is any back-port of ACPI to 2.2.
&gt; &gt; Problem: 2-way machine, so APM does not work.
&gt; &gt; I would love my box powers down when I shutdown...just like macs.
&gt; 
&gt; No, the current ACPI drivers haven't been backported, and it is neither
&gt; planned nor possible, since the drivers rely on the new power management
&gt; interface introduced in 2.4 and also all drivers being ported to this
&gt; interface.
&gt; 
&gt; Power-down should also work with APM on SMP boxen by activating APM just
&gt; before shutdown. I don't recall since what version this is in the kernel,
&gt; but it might be worth looking at.

Is my 2.2.14 patch still on the website?  That might do the job.
Don't know much about it, except that it has virtually no ACPI
functionality bar poweroff.  Might be worth a try if APM refuses to
work.

I have a good idea.

The previous release had a problem where handlers were being over-installed,
resulting in AE_EXIST (error 7). We installed handlers in two places - we
did a namespace walk for all PCI root bridges (based on HID) and installed
one, and then we also, on first access to a region, walk up the tree to see
if there are any PCI bridges between us and the root, and if so, we install
one then, too.

I believed the latter code negated the need for the former, and removed the
former. I'm not too surprised something broke (but it didn't break anything
on my machines ;-)

Can you narrow down where in the init process this is happening? The two
places I would think it would happen (ns_initialize_objects or
ns_initialize_devices) both would emit additional messages if their
respective walk_namespace failed.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I've just reflashed my BIOS with the latest from ASUS (km1009.bin) to no 
&gt; avail - ACPI fails in exactly the same fashion as reported yesterday. I have, 
&gt; however, found something more interesting :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I vaguely remember having seen 'ACPI: Sx supported' type messages from the 
&gt; kernel in the past, and I know from inspection of the source that only the 
&gt; AML-interpreter version generates such strings. I decided to go back to an 
&gt; early testXX kernel to see if I could find a working version.
&gt; 
&gt; I picked test5, and compiled it with exactly the same settings as I'm using 
&gt; with test11+acpica-linux-debug-20001115. Well, almost - normally I compile 
&gt; AGP support directly into the kernel, but if I do this with test5 it oopses 
&gt; trying to initialise AGP. Booting this kernel results in working ACPI, 
&gt; replete with 'ACPI: Sx supported' type messages.
&gt; 
&gt; I then tried test7, which failed:
&gt; 
&gt; ACPI: support found
&gt; ACPI: namespace load failed
&gt; ACPI:         -0550: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Success: Entire namespace and objects 
&gt; deleted
&gt; 
&gt; I then tried test6, which failed:
&gt; 
&gt; ACPI: support found
&gt; ACPI:         -0531: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Error: Ns_search_and_enter: bad parameter
&gt; ACPI: namespace load failed
&gt; ACPI:         -0550: &lt;7&gt;ACPI: *** Success: Entire namespace and objects 
&gt; deleted
&gt; 
&gt; Then I realised that I hadn't disabled AGP when compiling 6 &amp; 7 as I had done 
&gt; for 5. To make sure, I recompiled test6 with AGP disabled:
&gt; 
&gt; ACPI: support found
&gt; ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0x0810:6
&gt; ACPI: S1 supported
&gt; ACPI: S5 supported                                                            
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, that's interesting - it works fine with AGP disabled! The next thing I 
&gt; tried was test11+acpica-linux-debug-20001115 without AGP:
&gt; 
&gt; ACPI Subsystem version [Dec  3 2000]
&gt; ACPI: System description tables found
&gt; tbxface-0089: ACPI Tables successfully loaded

&gt; 
&gt; It still fails, but it gets a lot further along in the process. Is the kernel 
&gt; AGP initialisation clobbering the ACPI tables in memory ?
&gt; 
&gt; What I'll probably try next is to compile successive kernels without AGP 
&gt; support starting with test7 and find the point where it breaks.

Subject: PM in 2.2

Hi everyone.

I would like to know if there is any back-port of ACPI to 2.2.
Problem: 2-way machine, so APM does not work.
I would love my box powers down when I shutdown...just like macs.

The general model appears to be the OS can do throttling, but the chipset
will also throttle  independently if things get too hot (IIRC Intel chipsets
have a THRM# input signal that indicates this Thermal Override condition.)
so that a hung OS can't damage the processor.

I would think a motherboard that reported no software throttling, but did it
on its own would not be the ideal implementation, but in the real world, not
uncommon.

It's hard to say that's what this mobo is doing, though. And, I didn't think
desktop processors usually throttle much.

&gt; I have a question regarding CPU throttling on the Athlon.
&gt; 
&gt; I want buy a new Motherboard and wanted to know whether the CPU
&gt; throttling on the Athlon depends on the BIOS or just the chip set.
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding is that the Siemens Motherboards (Intel 
&gt; though) have a
&gt; microcontroller onboard that implements the thermal/noise strategy OS
&gt; independant. Shouldn't this be done by the OS (Linux in my case)?
&gt; 
&gt; Any sugggestions?

&gt; Is my 2.2.14 patch still on the website?  That might do the job. Don't
&gt; know much about it, except that it has virtually no ACPI functionality
&gt; bar poweroff.  Might be worth a try if APM refuses to work.

Yes, it is, but it's not linked, as it was posted to the list only. The

Please download the latest source and patches from:

That said, the latest source will not result in a working lid. This is
because the lid device has yet to be implemented on Linux.

Subject: [Acpi] Hangs on shutdown


Hi there i run 2.4.0-test11 on slackware.
When i run 'init 0' the machine hangs after the shutdown script finnish
with the message "ACPI: S5 faild".
The shutdown script contains:
    killall5 -15
    sleep 5
    killall5 -9
 
If i delete these lines the computer halt as it should but the root
partition will not be unmounted because processes are still accessing 
the disc and i will have a fsck on boot.
 
The problem is that 'killall5' kills [acpi] and acpid.
acpid can i restart after the partition is remounted ro but i cant restart
[acpi].
Isn't [acpi] supose to ignore these signals?
If you have a smarter shutdown script that dosn't kill [acpi] cold you
please mail it to me?

&gt; This is exactly right. However, we don't want to have to re-write OSPM for
&gt; each platform. So, ACPI is designed to abstract the platform-specific stuff
&gt; into control methods, which in turn do the dirty work, when called by OSPM.

Ok. It just seems that the current OSPM interface doesn't give the device
driver a way to turn its own device off.

Just a minor correction...
Upon waking from S4, the firmware does not jump to the OS waking vector.  In
S4, the OS is responsible for restoring memory, so at the point that the
firmware passes control to the OS, there won't be a valid address in the
FACP for the waking vector.  In the resume from S4 state, the firmware loads
the OS in the same manner that it does when it boots normally.  In most
cases, the OS loader determines that it's resuming from S4 (somehow), and
takes the S4 resume path.

Subject: RE: [Acpi] resume


I will try to answer some of these questions.
Guy

-&gt; The ACPI spec describes this for you, though I wouldn't recommend that
-&gt; document for anyone that is not a masochist.
-
-The next time I feel like punishing myself I'll look into it. Thanks.

I spent a lot of time trying to make the spec more readable in 2.0. The 1.0
spec had for the most part an author per chapter so there were problems with
redundancy, inconsistent nomenclature and frankly ordering. I couldn't read
it either so while it's nowhere near perfect.... 2.0 should be much better -
try it.


-Ok.
-But what makes it decide to wake up from S2 or S3?
-Say the system is in one of these states and (I'm guessing here) the CPU is
-halted (whatever that means -- probably depends on the CPU). Then I push a
-wakeup button. What happens next? Which part of the system gets the signal?
-How does it know what to do with it up to the point where it gets the next
-CPU address from the Waking Vector? What decides which actions can wake the
-system up?

ACPI compatible hardware contains "wake logic" as defined by the acpi spec.
ACPI compatible wake capable and enabled devices assert a signal when a wake
event occurs (see ACPI 2.0 section 4.7.2.3). This signal is enabled for
propagation through to the wake logic by writing an acpi specified register
- either a bit in the PM1 Enable (for RTC wake up) or a GPE enable bit (see
ACPI 2.0 section 4.7.4.1.1.1) as specified by _PRW for generic hardware.

A wake event sets the wake status bit in the PM1status register (bit 15).
This is done BY HARDWARE as a direct result of the wake event and causes the
system to transition back into the S0 state. In wake from S1, the chipset
starts clocking the cpu again and the cpu continues from the previous
instruction. In s2-s4, the CPU is reset and the BIOS executes - checking the
firmware waking vector as described and then jumps to that vector.


-If BIOS firmware is responsible for handling wakeup until we start running
-the OS-registered wakeup handler, then is the CPU running the BIOS
firmware?

yes, from the rest vector on S2-S4 but not from S1

-If so, what woke it up and told it to start running the BIOS firmware?

The system's wake logic as described above.


-That helps. It sounds like basically just another interrupt service routine
-(but a complicated one). And the standard interrupt vector I take it is
-different from the Firmware Waking Vector.

The most important thing to remember is that Wake and Interrupt are
completely separate and different. The wake logic causes the chipset to
transition the system back into S0 and this includes allowing the CPU to
resume the execution of instructions either from the reset vector or at the
next instruction after the sleep enable bit write.

Guy

I'm thinking your system is actually reporting slightly less than 96MB.

OK, let's debug why acpidmp reports that message.

'cat /dev/mem &gt;file.dat'

How big is file.dat? acpidmp is trying to map offset 100,597,760
(0x05ff0000) so if it's smaller, then that explains its failure. I think
this means that Linux is misinformed as to how much memory your system has.

What does dmesg say regarding memory on boot? Can you post your
BIOS-provided physical ram map?

Linux-specific changes:
--------------------
Improved battery support (Brendan Burns)
Fixed sleep_on race (David Woodhouse)

Core changes:
--------------------
Fixed a problem where named references within the ASL definition of both
OperationRegions and CreateXXXFields did not work properly.  The symptom
was an AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE during initialization of the region/field.
This is similar (but not related internally) to the problem that was
fixed in the last label.

Implemented both 32-bit and 64-bit support for the BCD ASL functions
ToBCD and FromBCD.

Strings in returned packages now have trailing null.

Updated all legal headers to include "2000" in the copyright years.

The following fixes a circular depency problem between
drivers/acpi/ and arch/{i386,ia64}/kernel/acpi.c.  I think the
problem only occurs if you manually tweak the build to make
acpi.o as a module, but it still should be fixed.  This patch
also fixes the Makefiles in drivers/acpi so that they do not
blow up if you try to build drivers/acpi as a module (these
are corrections to some variable names, not a new functional
addition to the Makefiles).

	I have deliberately not included the patch to change
CONFIG_ACPI into a tristate because I wonder if there is some problem
with acpi.o as a module that I am not aware of that is the reason
that CONFIG_ACPI in the stock kernels is configured as a boolean, even
though there is module initialization code in drivers/acpi, that seems
to work just fine, at least for my purposes of deactivating the
power after a shutdown.  Does anybody know if there some known problem
with acpi.o as a module?

	I have attached my kernel patch below.  If this meets with
no obections, can somebody bless this and "send" it to Linus for
integration?

&gt; &gt; code is there and it seemed to work, at least for shutting off the
&gt; &gt; power after a shutdown).  Unfortunately, in 2.4.0-test13pre3, this
&gt; &gt; is no harder to do, because there is a circular dependency:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; drivers/acpi/ references acpi_get_rsdp_ptr in arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c,
&gt; &gt; 				and
&gt; &gt; arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c references acp_find_root_pointer in 
&gt; &gt; drivers/acpi/.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	I would like to recommend that the contents of
&gt; &gt; arch/i{386,a64}/kernel/acpi.c be merged back somewhere in 
&gt; &gt; drivers/acpi/,
&gt; &gt; and just selected with Makefile options, ifdefs, or perhaps runtime
&gt; &gt; options (if the ia64 code is potentionally useable to an i386 kernel
&gt; &gt; that find itself running on an ia64 CPU, which will probably 
&gt; &gt; be the case
&gt; &gt; with most Linux distributions initially installed on ia64 hardware).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	If need be, I would be willing to at least write a quick and
&gt; &gt; dirty #ifdef-based version of this proposed change.

Hi Linus,

This patch against test13-pre3 fixes the following:

	- missed wakeups (David Woodhouse)
	- circular dependency (Adam J. Richter)
	- Embedded Controller fixes (us)
	- preliminary battery /proc interface (Brendan Burns &amp; me)
	- fixed named references error (us)
	- 32 &amp; 64 bit support for BCD ASL functions (us)
	- Null-terminates strings returned in packages (us)
	- other misc cleanups.

Thanks -- Regards -- Andy

Hi there,

I luckily own a sony vaio z700tek since a short time and tried to get it to
work with acpi. I already tried kernel 2.4.0-test12 which booted but did not
work out when trying to send it in sleep mode. So I patched it with the
intel patch from 12/15/2000 - since then I am not actually able to boot the
vaio with acpi enabled. It always locks after loading the system tables. A
little debugging showed that it does not return from calling the user
function on level 5 in _ns_walks_namespace.

I tried as well to user test13-pre3 with the latest patch (12/20/2000)
from Andrew Grover
but could not extract the patch from the archives (coudl someone maybe
mail it to me?) and the unpatched kernel seems to be the same as test12
patched with the mentioned patch from 12/15/2000 - at least it locked up a
the same point.

I have to mention that lock up means that the kernel does not lock the hard
way since the vaio is still soft-resetable.

Um, and yes, the hardware: z600tek is a european edition - its a pentium III
- 700 with phoenix bios 4.0 rev 6 and intel chipset.

I would gladly joing in and help on development if someone could point me to
where to look for the problem...

Thanks in advance

Hi,

as there has been no official announcement so far, just a new link on the
homepage, here it goes:

We've added a new mailing list, linux-power@phobos.fs.tum.de . The list
topic is power management under Linux in general (which most likely means
the new PM API), to keep that separate from the ACPI-for-Unix stuff.

Subscription goes via the usual message

 To: linux-power-request@phobos.fs.tum.de
 Subject: subscribe

or on the web (http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/ tells you).

&gt; I can reproduce it 100% too, although I think it's different from
&gt; Jens' problem - he says his machine doesn't support ACPI.  I'm afraid
&gt; I haven't had a lot of time to do investigative work.
Actually the machine (Toshiba Satellite 4000CDS does support ACPI. But
it does not work (at least under Linux - not sure about Windows).

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; it is not initialised correctly.  If the NIC ispluged in *after* booting it's
&gt; fine.  If the NIC is unplugged and replugged it's fine.  It's just that
&gt; first boot.
Same here. Also a modem card does not show the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is some dmesg output.  The important part is the "cs:
&gt; cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0xffff, device 0xffff".  That's where
&gt; things start to go wrong.
That part looks a bit different here:
The last line of the dmesg output is where I reinsert the card.

Hi,

to quote Krusty the Klown:

"So have a merry Christmas, Happy Hanukah, Kwazy Kwanzaa, a tip-top Tet,
and a solemn, dignified Ramadan."

I'm taking a few days off, Max and Marcel will (hopefully) take a look at
the list. Another small thing: Please double-check your vacation
autoresponders don't reply to list mail.

See you all in the new millenium,
   Simon

&gt; Can anyone tell us exactly why BAT1's _STA doesn't work?
&gt; 
&gt; The disassembler's output of this method definitely looks weird:
&gt; 
&gt; 00001bf2:           Method _STA (\_SB_.PCI0.ISA_.EC0_.BAT1._STA)
&gt; 00001bf8:             ArgCount 0; NotSerialized
&gt; 00001bf9:             And
&gt; 00001bfa:               &lt;NULL&gt;
&gt; 00001bfe:               0xdb
&gt; 00001c00:               0x80
&gt; 00001c02:             0x0100
&gt; 00001c05:             Local1

Interpreter is failing with execution of user defined 
control method at 00001bfa.  0xdb and 0x80 are
the argments to the control method.
 
I don't know if interpreter is doing 1path or 2paths to load Namespace.
I think interpreter should do 2 paths (or 1 initialization and runtime evaluation)
to get number of arguments to the user defined control methods.
Because no ANSI C type function prototype statement in ASL.

Subject: [Acpi] Re: ACPI on Sony Vaio


&gt; 
&gt; Hi Knut, everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I luckily own a sony vaio z700tek since a short time and tried to get it to
&gt; &gt; work with acpi. I already tried kernel 2.4.0-test12 which booted but did not
&gt; &gt; work out when trying to send it in sleep mode. So I patched it with the
&gt; &gt; intel patch from 12/15/2000 - since then I am not actually able to boot the
&gt; &gt; vaio with acpi enabled. It always locks after loading the system tables. A
&gt; &gt; little debugging showed that it does not return from calling the user
&gt; &gt; function on level 5 in _ns_walks_namespace.
&gt; 
&gt; Like on my vaio z505ls it is probably stuck executing the _STA method of
&gt; the _SB_PCI0ISA_EC0_BAT1 device.
&gt; 
&gt; I've modified the code to skip execution of this method and a few others
&gt; which also hang. See patch below. It is by no means a proper fix, just a
&gt; quick hack to let the system boot. Please try it on your system and let 
&gt; me know the results.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell us exactly why BAT1's _STA doesn't work?
&gt; 
&gt; The disassembler's output of this method definitely looks weird:
&gt; 
&gt; 00001bf2:           Method _STA (\_SB_.PCI0.ISA_.EC0_.BAT1._STA)
&gt; 00001bf8:             ArgCount 0; NotSerialized
&gt; 00001bf9:             And
&gt; 00001bfa:               &lt;NULL&gt;
&gt; 00001bfe:               0xdb
&gt; 00001c00:               0x80
&gt; 00001c02:             0x0100
&gt; 00001c05:             Local1
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps it uses opcodes not supported by the current Linux ACPI 
&gt; implementation??
&gt; 
&gt; I've appended BAT1 sections of both raw acpidmp and "acpidmp DSDT |
&gt; acpidisasm" output below. Complete dumps available upon request.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tried as well to user test13-pre3 with the latest patch (12/20/2000)
&gt; &gt; from Andrew Grover
&gt; &gt; but could not extract the patch from the archives (coudl someone maybe
&gt; &gt; mail it to me?) and the unpatched kernel seems to be the same as test12
&gt; &gt; patched with the mentioned patch from 12/15/2000 - at least it locked up a
&gt; &gt; the same point.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have to mention that lock up means that the kernel does not lock the hard
&gt; &gt; way since the vaio is still soft-resetable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Um, and yes, the hardware: z600tek is a european edition - its a pentium III
&gt; &gt; - 700 with phoenix bios 4.0 rev 6 and intel chipset.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would gladly joing in and help on development if someone could point me to
&gt; &gt; where to look for the problem...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance

This seems to be a problem that was introduced with the big ACPI update
as pointed out earlier by Andrew Morton.  Try disabling ACPI (since your
BIOS does not seem to have ACPI support anyway it should not be a
disadvantage) and see if PCMCIA support works again on bootup.

What is the "implicit return" problem, and is there a workaround?  I found
no reference to it in the archives.

TIA,

As I wrote in the subject line I get an oops with 2.4.0-test13-pre7.

Board: Gigabyte BXD with newest BIOS, Dual processor

Previous kernels ( &lt;=-test12) just printed

ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 0 @ 0x0000:0
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0x0000:0
	-0196: *** Error: Sleep State package elements are not both of type
number

Now I get the attached oops.
I've tracked it back into acpi_ns_get_next_object: that function is
called with both child_node and parent_node == NULL, and then the line

	if (parent_node-&gt;child)

oopses.

If you need further infos, please ask.

	At least when I build acpi as a module under 2.4.0-test13-pre5
(which requires tweaking the Makefiles and a config.in, but no 
modifications to .c or .h files), acpi gets into an infinite loop
when it is loaded as a module on a Transmeta-based Sony PictureBook.
The same kernel+module loads fine on a desktop machine that I tried,
and doing the same on 2.4.0-test13-pre3 works fine on both computers.
The problem is still in test13-pre7.

	From a day of reboots and printk's, I know that the infinite
loop includes at the following call hierarchy:

		acpi_resolve_to_value
		acpi_resolve_node_to_value
		acpi_aml_access_named_field
		acpi_aml_read_field
		acpi_aml_read_field_data

	I also know that, elsewhere in the inifinite loop,
acpi_release_parse_tree is called, as are acpi_cm_{acquire,release}_mutex.

	I know that the following calls are made shortly before
the infinite loop starts:

		acpi_aml_exec_store
		acpi_aml_store_object_to_node
		acpi_aml_access_named_field
		acpi_aml_write_field
		acpi_aml_write_field_data

	I will explore this more tomorrow, but I have been exploring
this problem on and off for three days, so I thought I ought to
mention it on linux-kernel.

Folks,

thanks for your help, i changed the 0 to SA_SHIRQ in ad1848.c and that
appears to make ACPI and my sound card co-exist happily...

but i've run into a couple of other issues:

1)
On startup i get the messages:
psparse-0681: Parse_loop: Found unknown opcode 0x13 at AML offset 0x0, ignoring
breakpoint: Fatal error encountered

repeated about 15 times in my kernel log.  I understand that the first
message indicates that my ACPI is probably buggy and contains an invalid
opcode (0x13=19)  But I'm not sure why the fatal error is being generated.

2)
everyother time i startup (startups mod 2 ==1) my display goes to sleep
(eg doesn't display) but the computer starts up fine the keyboard is still
active etc, but the display won't wake up (I've pressed the power button,
hit keys, the mouse etc)

on the other times (startups mod 2 ==0) the display blinks into sleep and
then restores itself.

Anyone have any pointers for debugging?



On the good news side i have begun development work on the battery
support.  I have most of the battery parsing code done (though it's not
quite presentable yet)  once i clean it up I'll release a patch.  and then
add a /proc/sys/acpi/batteryN (or something like that) file.


Thanks,
Brendan

Hey folks,
attached is a patch which adds more battery support to the 10-29 code, it
adds some print outs to the kernel startup as well as adding
/proc/sys/acpi/battery which contains the u32 in _BIF-&gt;remaining_capacity.

I need to flesh out the code some more so that the info in the proc file
is better but unfortunatly the acpi on my HP appears to be quite buggy and
it returns 0xffffffff (unknown) for both the last full capacity value and
the remaining capacity value, though i'm pretty sure my code works, i
can't really test it too much so i would appreciate others testing this
out.

Thanks,

by the way this patch is for the 10-29 debug version available from intel.

Hi Linus,

Since ACPI is now in the kernel, I figure that its top level
sysctl tag should be in sysctl.h. Also, this patch claims an
tag for APM as I want to add some sysctl's for APM soon.

By the way, is there a "correct" way to claim sysctl tags?

Cheers,
Stephen

Just so you all know, we're prepping the next drop, and it should be any day
now. We've been doing some major surgery, and while things look good on
IA32, we still need to validate things work on IA64 before we release it.

Things that will have changed:
- Power-off should work on more systems.
- ACPI 2.0 table support.
- User-mode ACPI support has been removed.
- ACPI chipset support has been removed.
- Interpreter fixes.
- Better boot messages.
- OS memory interfaces expanded to 64 bits.

ACPI 2.0 table support was the big change, and broke a couple of features
that we had been hanging on to, but not really working on. The
simplification and decreased maintenance burden brought about by their
removal made taking them out a pretty easy call.

Anyway, once this is released, we can get back to what we REALLY want to do
-- add features. ;-)

I'll post another message when we actually release it.

I'm sure this has been asked, but I could not find it in the achives.
acpi seems to be working fine on a ThinkPad A20, but unlike apmd, it
does not restore the system time when it comes out of suspend. Is there
a way to make it do this?
I do not have the interpreter enabled.

So I've updated the BIOS on my HP hoping that it would enable ACPI a
little better (and looking at the DSDT it does...) but now ACPI fails on
boot.  The kernel messages are as follows:

ACPI Subsystem version [Nov 11 2000]

Anobody have any clue why?  It seems like there are a lot more debug
statements that could be turned on, is there a switch in the code/headers
to do this?

Thanks

I too got this problem with the new source, however digging into the old
source I noticed that the rsdp_phys variable was obtained through a call
to acpi_find_root_pointer().

I substituted:
acpi_find_root_pointer(&amp;rsdp_phys);
for
rsdp_phys=acpi_get_rsdp_ptr();

It compiles and links fine now.

Yeah, I checked the website this weekend, and it hadn't updated. It looks
like it's updated now, though. My hunch is that the update got caught in the
Pentium 4 undertow. ;-)

Anyway, the patch fixed this. find_rsdp_ptr is an arch-specific call (the
only one, in fact) so it goes in arch/i386/kernel. Some other makefile/build
stuff is changed by the patch as well.

38 Devices found: 38 _STA, 0 _INI, 21 _HID, 1 PCIRoot

(unpatched, ACPI_NO_PCI_INIT), it now prints

38 Devices found: 38 _STA, 0 _INI, 0 _HID, 0 PCIRoot

Hope that's ok :)

Thanks Robert.

Try this patch. All the special-case stuff in hwregs.c around line 700
apparently isn't being called. Thus, there are redundant writes happening,
AND SLP_EN is being set with interrupts enabled.

Kinda surprised it worked on my machine. ;-)

Anyways, give it a go. I'm not sure this will fix it but this was definitely
a bug.

&gt; Try this. Redundant writes are gone, but offset should be 0.
&gt; 
&gt; Against 11_15 DEBUG.

&gt; &gt; value	offset	register_bit_width	address
&gt; &gt; 32768	0	32			58368
&gt; &gt; 32768	0	32			0
&gt; &gt; 7169	4	16			58372

&gt; &gt; 8193	6	16			58372
&gt; &gt; 8193	6	16			0

Offset is 0, and the 8193s are now 15361s. Apart from that, the values
stayed the same. It doesn't power off.

Regards,
Robert

The current plan is to support all ACPI S-states. Our goal is to have APM
replacement functionality working on select mobile platforms by about mid
2001. This includes S3 and perhaps S4. We are working on a device power
management framework that will enable this as all drivers must participate
in power management. We will distribute the PM framework design for review
within the next month or so.

Hello,

I saw in HOWTO that current implementation does S1 and that further modes
are studied.
Do you plan to implement S3 (Suspend to RAM)?
S3 is very attractive.

Jeff,
Toshiba's BIOS has a problem where they do not have a RETURN statement in
their _STA method. We have asked them to change it.  Microsoft's AML
interpreter's design by chance takes the result of the previous return in
this case. Andy will get back to you on the others.

Yeah, that patch was against test11-pre5, and there was a slight change that
made it not apply cleanly against test11-final. Oh well.

Expect another release pretty soon, to fix this, and the other stuff that's
been fixed.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to interrupt the intresting Robert/Andy thread..but I just got
&gt; the acpi-linux-debug-20001115.tar.gz and the patch. The patch 
&gt; fails with 
&gt; linux-2.4.0-test11 here's what I get:
&gt; 
&gt; patching file linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c
&gt; Hunk #3 FAILED at 26.
&gt; 1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file 
&gt; linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c.rej
&gt; 
&gt; Is this normal should I go on with compiling the kernel?
&gt; Also should I apply the hwregs.diff, hwregs2.diff, 
&gt; nsinit.diff posted here 
&gt; afterwards or are these specific to Robert's Asus mobo ?
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; We will not implement bug for bug compatibility with Microsoft's ACPI
&gt; implementation. One of the reasons for a second ACPI implementation is to
&gt; verify implementation to be in accordance with the ACPI specification. It
&gt; undermines the spec to allow a dominant OSV to establish a defacto standard.
&gt; In some cases, it may be necessary to mimic OS behavior that is not clearly
&gt; specified or if ambiguous in the ACPI spec. Of course, the difficulty of
&gt; being bug for bug compatible also plays a role here. If it was easy then it
&gt; may seem reasonable to have a switch that would enable certain non spec
&gt; system behaviors. The _STA issue (no return), is not something we can easily
&gt; accommodate.

Implementing bug-for-bug compatibility in ACPICA is definitely a bad
idea...  It's much more flexible to snag the bad ACPI tables, fix them
up offline, and then reboot with the patched tables.  No kernel bloat
necessary...

Hello,

on my system, the new ACPI-version fails to initialize. This is
because the call to acpi_install_address_space_handler in nsinit.c
fails with AE_EXIST. Relevant output of dmesg is

If I disable the PCI initialization (by passing ACPI_NO_PCI_INIT to
acpi_enable_subsystem in driver.c), ACPI is enabled, although I still
get an error.

The same message (Exec_monadic2_r/Not: bad operand(s) (0x3005))
is printed when the system is halted (together with "ACPI: S5
failed").

The output of dmesg when PCI is disabled is:

&gt; Anyways, give it a go. I'm not sure this will fix it but this was
&gt; definitely a bug.

Thanks for the patch, but it still doesn't shut down. Now, the offset
also varied, so I'll include that in the table.

width = 16, address_space_id = 1, register_bit_offset = 0, reserved = 0

Try this. Redundant writes are gone, but offset should be 0.

Against 11_15 DEBUG.

Thanks -- Regards -- Andy

&gt; From: Robert Vollmert [mailto:rvollmert@gmx.net]
&gt; &gt; Anyways, give it a go. I'm not sure this will fix it but this was
&gt; &gt; definitely a bug.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the patch, but it still doesn't shut down. Now, the offset
&gt; also varied, so I'll include that in the table.
&gt; 
&gt; width = 16, address_space_id = 1, register_bit_offset = 0, 
&gt; reserved = 0
&gt; 
&gt; value	offset	register_bit_width	address
&gt; 32768	0	32			58368
&gt; 32768	0	32			0
&gt; 7169	4	16			58372
&gt; 7169	5	16			0
&gt; 8193	6	16			58372
&gt; 8193	6	16			0

Interesting!

2 issues, huh?

&gt; From: Robert Vollmert [mailto:rvollmert@gmx.net]
&gt; on my system, the new ACPI-version fails to initialize. This is
&gt; because the call to acpi_install_address_space_handler in nsinit.c
&gt; fails with AE_EXIST. Relevant output of dmesg is

Number 1 - Address space handler init

Can you send me your DSDT? 'cat /proc/sys/acpi/dsdt &gt;~/dsdt.dat'

We install a default PCI address space handler at the root of the namespace,
and then additional handlers for each PCI bridge. Could it be that a PCI
bridge is the root device? Don't know. It hopefully will be pretty easy to
figure out from looking at the DSDT.

&gt; Completing Region and Field initialization:............

&gt; .... ammonad-0284: Exec_monadic2_r/Not: bad operand(s) (0x3005)
&gt; breakpoint: Fatal error encountered

Number 2 - Bad operand error

So on shutdown it's the call to eval _PTS that's causing this?

And, does the machine actually turn off?

Hi all,

Sorry to interrupt the intresting Robert/Andy thread..but I just got
the acpi-linux-debug-20001115.tar.gz and the patch. The patch fails with 
linux-2.4.0-test11 here's what I get:

patching file linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c
Hunk #3 FAILED at 26.
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file 
linux/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c.rej

Is this normal should I go on with compiling the kernel?
Also should I apply the hwregs.diff, hwregs2.diff, nsinit.diff posted here 
afterwards or are these specific to Robert's Asus mobo ?

Thanks,
Mahmood

&gt;From what I understand, a great many Toshiba laptops and other BIOS's
have ACPI tables which do not perfectly conform to spec, or are in some
other way unusable.

I would -really- like to make sure that Linux users have a solution they
can turn to when this happens for them.

Can we upload better ACPI tables from userspace, after boot, and then
tell ACPICA to reinitialize?

Can we provide a set of common fixups, which are applied before
initialization, to repair commonly-found AML mistakes?  (for another
example of fixups in the Linux kernel, read arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c,
grep for 'pcibios_fixups')

Telling users "tell your vendor to fix their broken BIOS" is an
extremely poor option, especially when few vendors care enough about the
issue.  :(

Jeff,
Of course this capability would be convenient for the developers and the
folks that have the ability to invoke it. Generally, I am very much against
fixing things that the OEM has not sanctioned because it is not supported by
the OEM. This would necessarily be the requirement if Linux were much more
mainstream i.e. found commonly as an optional pre-install OS. In the mean
time, it does make sense for both debugging purposes and for those who want
to take responsibility themselves to provide the ability to fix ACPI
firmware problems. The problem is that we need those changes during the
first pass through. The DSDT cannot be unloaded and reloaded. Unfortunately
file services are not available during early kernel initialization when ACPI
would need to read alternative tables. There are two potential solutions to
this problem. The easiest is to capture the table, convert to ASL, fix it,
convert back to AML and then compile it with the kernel - making the kernel
machine specific. This is what we do to get around problems before we have
BIOS updates. The second more preferable solution would be to change the
bootloader to load an AML file(s) along with the kernel and find a way for
ACPI CA to find out about them. If you would like to look into the last
one... that would be great as it it currently low on our priority list - as
we can do the former.

Subject: [Acpi] Fixing broken ACPI tables?


&gt;From what I understand, a great many Toshiba laptops and other BIOS's
have ACPI tables which do not perfectly conform to spec, or are in some
other way unusable.

I would -really- like to make sure that Linux users have a solution they
can turn to when this happens for them.

Can we upload better ACPI tables from userspace, after boot, and then
tell ACPICA to reinitialize?

Can we provide a set of common fixups, which are applied before
initialization, to repair commonly-found AML mistakes?  (for another
example of fixups in the Linux kernel, read arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c,

Why is this, again?  This premise seems to complicate life
significantly.  It's unlikely that LILO is ever going to be
hacked to load an alternate DSDT.  Why not reload or, if
that is totally impossible, delay loading based on a kernel

ACPI prohibits unloading the DSDT. The init sequence requires _PRT before
the PCI driver and the PCI driver may be needed before the disk can be up.

This semi-coincides with linuxbios' need to be able to provide a memory
map to the kernel, when the E820/E801 (and other) BIOS calls are not
available.

I would still prefer the former (as given the above example) -- such a
solution works just fine from an initial ramdisk ("initrd"), and
requires no modification of the low-level boot/setup code, nor
modification of boot loaders.  And since initrd data is loaded when the
kernel image is loaded, its data is present when ACPICA needs it to be.

This doesn't work for several reasons:

 - If ACPI "fails", there's a good chance it will take your machine out
   with it.
 - One of the key uses for ACPI is hardware discovery; this includes
   locating and configuring root busses, motherboard devices, etc.  You
   need to do this before you get anywhere near having a filesystem
   or userspace programs (unless you're loading from a ramdisk, which is 
   functional but ugly).

In reality, the whole "fix AML for the vendor" situation has lots of 
parallels with the "Milo/PALcode for non-SRM" Alpha problem.  Only the 
scope of the challenge is much more loosely defined.

I've only heard of a few Dell laptops which -require- ACPI to be

reports on linux-kernel I've seen; I only know about the Dell laptop
requirement from a Dell engineer's posts.

Modern IA32 may "mandate" functional ACPI, but in the meantime
motherboard manufacturers are churning out new mobos which work just
fine on ACPI-less Linux 2.2.x.  Requiring ACPI means you cannot use a
lot of operating systems.  Or you must upgrade your system software [to
get ACPI support] from something well-known, well-tested and stable, to
something unknown and potentially unstable.  Locked out operating
systems and nervous IT managers combined mean that ACPI won't be a
requirement for a while...

Hell, just imagine trying to get mobo makers to mass produce something
that cannot run DOS and Win3.1 ;-)

&gt; Milo; I fear we would be looking at literally thousands that might need
&gt; ACPI fixes.

The number of machines with buggy ACPI tables is totally irrelevant. 
It's the diversity and number of problems which affects the tables. 
Consider 100,000 Toshiba laptops fail to return objects from the _STA
methods, thus killing ACPICA -- fixing that one problem will probably
fix 100,000 laptops in a single stroke.

BIOS engineers don't purposefully create ACPI tables which kill your
machine.  But sometimes they make common I'm-new-to-ACPI mistakes.  Or
their ASL compiler is buggy.  These sorts of things can be detected and
corrected with hueristics.

I'm not saying that bitching at OEMs shouldn't be the first option.  It
should.  But when a machine is too old, or a vendor too slow or
nonresponsive, fixing ACPI tables yourself should not be a big deal.

I agree that, if possible, the replacement ACPI tables should be
provided to the kernel from the bootloader.

However....   -if- a machine boots and sets up correctly, there is no
reason why you cannot load ACPI tables from userspace.  Maybe you must
avoid CPU or PCI bus type initializations.  So be it...  But that is not
100% of ACPI.  Uploading tables after boot has value for users desiring
poweroff and other S-states... and also it would be handy for developers
who are debugging power management code too.

Jeff,
Once the system is up and running it is difficult to re-initialize in ACPI
mode. Linux32 has a PNPBIOS legacy that it can rely on but ACPI only systems
do not. The _PRT must be parsed to get the PCI IRQ routing (file system).
During ACPI init, _INI methods are run and power resources are manipulated.
MP systems read and apply the Multiple APIC description table etc. All of
this cannot be done on a system that is already initialized without a TON of
coordination. The tables must be available EARLY. We can replace system
tables currently by combining them with the kernel otherwise an OEM BIOS
upgrade will fix problems.
Regards,
Guy

&gt; one... that would be great as it it currently low on our priority list -
as
&gt; we can do the former.

This semi-coincides with linuxbios' need to be able to provide a memory
map to the kernel, when the E820/E801 (and other) BIOS calls are not
available.

I would still prefer the former (as given the above example) -- such a
solution works just fine from an initial ramdisk ("initrd"), and
requires no modification of the low-level boot/setup code, nor
modification of boot loaders.  And since initrd data is loaded when the
kernel image is loaded, its data is present when ACPICA needs it to be.

Regards,

	Jeff

Well yeah, we still have bugs.

Eventually, ACPI should either 1) work or 2) fail gracefully. If we cannot
fail gracefully (and we can't right now on Toshiba laptops) then we can fail
gracefully by using a bad BIOS list. This is what MS does, BTW, and I don't
see a way around us doing the same thing. There are just too many buggy
BIOSs.

&gt; who are debugging power management code too.
&gt; 	Jeff

Yes, it would be handy. We're currently making some assumptions that we
probably couldn't make anymore, though.

&lt;thinking out loud&gt;
MS can load new tables at init from disk. We could do the same thing,
couldn't we, if only the root filesystem were mounted.

So, why is the root mounted when it is, as opposed to earlier? I'm sure
there's a reason, but I don't know it.

OR, modify lilo to take an alternate DSDT, and overwrite the bad one with
the new one before we see it? This would require no other changes, but this
sounds like a nontrivial lilo change.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

Agreed.

&gt; &lt;thinking out loud&gt;
&gt; MS can load new tables at init from disk. We could do the same thing,
&gt; couldn't we, if only the root filesystem were mounted.

You can't do it once the (Linux) kernel is up and running, due to the 
chicken-and-egg problem I've already mentioned.

&gt; OR, modify lilo to take an alternate DSDT, and overwrite the bad one with
&gt; the new one before we see it? This would require no other changes, but this
&gt; sounds like a nontrivial lilo change.

This is more or less the approach we'll be taking with FreeBSD.  Our 
bootloader is a lot more sophisticated though, so it's trivial to deal 
with (and not really relevant to this list).  But loading before you 
start the kernel is really the only way that makes any sense if you're 
going to use ACPI properly.

&gt; 
&gt; Send me a machine :)

Dell Inspiron (5000, 7500 series at least).  Sony F-series Vaio, just to 
name two that are giving me a headache.  The Inspiron is currently 
failing due to bugs in the ACPI CA interpreter (we think).  There's 
another failure mode that's hard to debug because the AML turns off the 
Super-IO chip (and thus you lose serial I/O) before ending up in a tight 
loop.  You can't even get a keyboard interrupt in (because the keyboard 
controller is gone too...).

&gt; Hell, just imagine trying to get mobo makers to mass produce something
&gt; that cannot run DOS and Win3.1 ;-)

Look for labels that say "legacy-free".  Some still work, some don't.

&gt; &gt; However, the
&gt; &gt; solution is, if anything, less easy, due to the fundamental nature of
&gt; &gt; ACPI to platform autoconfiguration, and the massively diverse set of
&gt; &gt; platforms out there.  There are only a handful of machines that need
&gt; &gt; Milo; I fear we would be looking at literally thousands that might need
&gt; &gt; ACPI fixes.
&gt; 
&gt; The number of machines with buggy ACPI tables is totally irrelevant. 
&gt; It's the diversity and number of problems which affects the tables. 

Yes, I realise this, sorry if I wasn't clear about it.  I meant 
"literally thousands of different models of system".

&gt; Consider 100,000 Toshiba laptops fail to return objects from the _STA
&gt; methods, thus killing ACPICA -- fixing that one problem will probably
&gt; fix 100,000 laptops in a single stroke.

Sure.  But that's one Toshiba laptop. They probably have a good ten 
different models using the same buggy ASL, multiplied by (say) five or so 
BIOS releases per model over the lifetime of the model, and that's fifty 
different sets of AML you need already.

&gt; BIOS engineers don't purposefully create ACPI tables which kill your
&gt; machine.  But sometimes they make common I'm-new-to-ACPI mistakes.  Or
&gt; their ASL compiler is buggy.  These sorts of things can be detected and
&gt; corrected with hueristics.

Typically, so far, the problems are mostly related to "it works with 
Windows"-syndrome, which is why I tend to argue for bug-compatibility 
rather than a painful mechanical workaround process.

&gt; However....   -if- a machine boots and sets up correctly, there is no
&gt; reason why you cannot load ACPI tables from userspace.  Maybe you must
&gt; avoid CPU or PCI bus type initializations.  So be it...  But that is not

&gt; poweroff and other S-states... and also it would be handy for developers
&gt; who are debugging power management code too.

Agreed.  It's just not a "correct" solution, hence it bugging me. 8)

-rather than a painful mechanical workaround process.

We will not implement bug for bug compatibility with Microsoft's ACPI
implementation. One of the reasons for a second ACPI implementation is to
verify implementation to be in accordance with the ACPI specification. It
undermines the spec to allow a dominant OSV to establish a defacto standard.
In some cases, it may be necessary to mimic OS behavior that is not clearly
specified or if ambiguous in the ACPI spec. Of course, the difficulty of
being bug for bug compatible also plays a role here. If it was easy then it
may seem reasonable to have a switch that would enable certain non spec
system behaviors. The _STA issue (no return), is not something we can easily
accommodate.

Guy

Well, this could even be done before lilo in a mbr (remembering of a mbr i
did to correct the year of a BIOS working only from 1995 to 1999).

But this kind of stuff is needed only on the new ACPI only hard, old
hardware could use Jeffs method, couldn't it? I mean, I still think that for
a lot of systems Jeff solution makes more sense and is implementable.

I couldn't figure out exactly why this patch failed, but I was

&gt; It fixes the error message, although the system still doesn't shut
&gt; off. So probably, these are not actually related?

Yeah, I agree.

So, outstanding issues are:

1) AE_EXIST error on PCI init (you're not the only one seeing this)

I just figured out what the problem here is. Probably be tomorrow before I
have a fix, though.

2) acpi_power_down() doesn't.

We need to know if the right values are being written to the sleep type
registers, etc.

In sys.c, could you add this line right before the three calls to
hw_register_bit_access():

	printk("slp type a = %x slp type b = %x\n", 
		ACPI_SLP_TYPA(acpi_slptyp[ctx-&gt;state]),
		ACPI_SLP_TYPB(acpi_slptyp[ctx-&gt;state]));

According to your DSDT, both of these should be 7.

The other thing to try would be putting a DEBUG_PRINT in hardware/hwregs.c
in acpi_hw_low_level_write() to verify where/what we're writing. This works
for me so I'm going to need your help on this one. ;-)

Just for your Information, this is no bug report ,)

I got a compaq presario 1400 some days ago.
- this laptop does not have APM.
- the laptop has a VIA Chipset
- Running Kernel 2.4.0-test11

Current ACPI works ok:
- ACPI is detected and enabled on startup:
&gt; System firmware supports: C2
&gt; System firmware supports: S0 S1 S4 S5
&gt; ACPI: Found a battery

entering sleep mode works sometimes.
I noticed the following behaviour:
- Sleep mode worked after bootup (battery full, on-line).
- After pulling the power plug sleep mode no longer worked (wakes up
immedeately)
- When i turn on power supply it does not work again
- even when the battery is fully charged again sleep does not work any
more.

What i miss most is suspend-to-disk.
When i had let my bios handle this alone, i could just press the power
button and the bios handles suspend-to-disk itself.
The only drawbacks: after wakeup the system-clock is not correct.

So i was wondering: is there a way to let the bios handle this itself
again?
Or should i just wait for a forthcoming release?

Thanks for all your great work into ACPI on Linux, sorry i cannot help
much except helping testing ACPI and perhaps writing some user-tools (like
a battery monitor).

Howdy.

This is just a report of the results of playing around with the current
ACPI tools on my laptop.  I appologize if this isn't helpful or useful.
I'm not really reporting a "bug" persay, it just seems like some of this
behavior is weird.  Maybe this helps with the development.

I'm playing with ACPI because APM currently crashes my laptop on resume.
(I've played with various kernel options; strangely APM resume works on
2.2.14; even more strangely, it works occasionally under later kernels, but
the system ends up dying a slow death, things begin to segfault, etc...  I
suspect this is a device driver not playing well with PM, but I haven't had
time to test that theory.)  I'd really like to get my laptop to suspend and
resume.  I'm pretty much guessing that ACPI on linux is a bit immature to
have this actually happen.

I have a Sony Vaio Z505LS.  It's a pretty new model.  It's based around an
Intel 440BX/PIIX4.

I've turned on the ACPI options in the kernel (2.4.0-test11), including the
interpreter.  I've enabled ACPI support in the BIOS.  (Which I believe is
by Phoenix.)

Booting with ACPI in the kernel works when the machine is cold booted (ie
waiting a while after shuting down, at least 5 min).  It hangs after "ACPI:
support found" when warm booting.

Various things seem much slower when ACPI is enabled.  I don't know how
else to describe this.  The whole system seems sluggish.  I suspect some
kind of interrupt problems (everything in this laptop is on IRQ 9, the cat,
the kitchen sink, and your mother are all on IRQ nine, see below for
details).  Video in particular is very slow.

echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/acpi/sleep

hangs the system hard.

pmtest reports:
root@smoke:/usr/local/src/pmtools# pmtest/pmtest
  VGA (D0)
  PCMCIA (D0)
  PCI 0x3a (D0)
  keyboard (D0)
  PCI 0x0 (D0)

cat /proc/sys/acpi/event
while pressing various buttons (including the power button) produces no
output what so ever.  There's a whole bunch of function key buttons on this
laptop; none of them do anything while under linux, nor under windows 2k.
They did do stuff under the version of windows ME that came with the
laptop, which I, of course, quickly erased in favor of linux.  (They were
completely functional on the previous model of this laptop (the Z505SX)
which doesn't support ACPI.  One of these keys controls the switch between
external and internal display, which I'd really like to have work).

I suspect that these function keys are now under ACPI control, but simply
haven't been enabled.  (I haven't tried the non-ALM-interpreter version to
see if I can enable them. If this would be useful, I'll try it.)

I've included the information requested in the ACPI readme below.

Thanks for your work so far, and good luck.

That's because we haven't implemented it yet. ;-) Under APM the OS just has
to read battery information from the BIOS. With OS power management (OSPM)
the OS requires more functionality. It's coming soon.

Subject: [Acpi] List of good/bad BIOSes
&gt; as some people have noticed, the list of BIOSes on
&gt; http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/bios.sql is a bit outdated. I'd like to
&gt; change that, but before we start to gather information, I'd like to have
&gt; an your opinion what we should collect.
It'd probably be useful to be able to submit acpidmp's output whole.
That way, the a script could get out of it whatever it wants, and we'd
grow a base of code to test our parsing off of.

Just put fields for dmesg stuff (optional), mobo vendor/name/rev,
BIOS ver, what works/doesn't work, other comments, and a 
&lt;input type="file"&gt; box to upload acpidmp's output.

Then the script can acpitbl it, and get the rest of these data.
Morover, if somthing else becomes relevant, we can get more
data out of the acpidmp that we didn't think of before.

(For example, can we link known bugs to compiler versions,
and cope.)

This issue came up a while back when mkr@redhat was trying to get the
ACPICA code up and running against a Dell Inspiron 7500.  I didn't find
any solutions mentioned in the list archive, and I've hit the same problem
with the same machine.  In my case, I'm running the A11 firmware and the
ACPICA-20000927 code is running under FreeBSD, but the symptoms are the
same (don't you love code reuse? 8).

While we're scanning the namespace in the process of attaching drivers to 
devices that have been enumerated, we come across the first battery.
In order to obtain the HID, we call AcpiGetObjectInfo.  This evaluates 
(in order) _INI, _HID, _STA and _ADR.  During the evaluation of _STA, we 
attempt to make an access to an address space of type 3 (Embedded 
Controller space).  At this point, there's been no Embedded Controller 
driver attached, and so everything stops.

Here is the ASL for the relevant parts of the battery code:

    Device(BAT0) {
        Name(_HID, 0x0a0cd041)
        Method(_STA) {
            If(\_SB_.PCI0.PX40.ECOK) {
                If(\_SB_.PCI0.PX40.EC0_.BAT0) {
                    Return(0x1f)
                }
                Else {
                    Return(0xf)
                }
            }
            Else {
                Return(0x1f)
            }
        }                                                                       

You see that it (correctly) invokes a method outside of the Embedded
Controller's scope (ECOK) to determine whether the Embedded Controller has
been activated.  Test code placed inside AcpiGetObjectInfo immediately
prior to evaluating the _STA method indicates that at this time, the ECOK
method returns 0.  Nevertheless, the interpreter continues and attempts to
evaluate EC0_.BAT0, which is inside the EC's address space and causing the
above failure.

Studying a verbose trace of the execution of the above code suggests that 
the method correctly returns 0 and that the interpreter thinks that it's 
correctly skipping the next block, however it obviously doesn't. 8)

I can provide a verbose dump of execution if desired (please specify 
which options you'd like), or more ASL, or a binary dump of the DSDT, 
etc. if it might help in diagnosing this.

Note that attempting to sort the namespace to eg. attach the EC before 
attaching the battery are problematic, since we would have to fetch the 
_HID manually, and this doesn't really work around the basic problem 
which is that the code above isn't being executed correctly.

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Regards,
Mike

Please see David Woodhouse's patch, which addresses this, I think.

The next source release will also include a fix for this, but another
release will not be immediately forthcoming.

Hi John,

Not finding the RSDP is bad. Does this machine support ACPI under Windows?
How to find the RSDP is described in the ACPI spec, so if we're not working,
they shouldn't be working either...;-)

The big debugging info switches are in include/acoutput.h. I've been meaning
to add this to our FAQ but haven't yet. Basically, the subsystem can spit
out a LOT of information if you ask it. However, your best bet might be
looking at tables/tbxfroot.c acpi_tb_find_rsdp(), and sticking some
diagnostic prints in.

That said, we're supposed to "fake it" on PIIX4 systems, but in that case
there would've been something in the boog log like "tables not found, using
chipset support". Was there?

Hi JMC,

Any test kernel should work.

Does this happen using a release version of your X server? Yhis may be an X
server issue. If ACPI is at fault, I think you'd either see a complete
system hang, or some output on the console, at least.

If you can definitively say it's ACPI, please include the output from dmesg,
and we'll examine further.

&gt; Which test kernel is recommended for use with this release?  I'm
&gt; running 2.4.0-test9, and also the Woodhouse patch to the acpi
&gt; debug sources.
&gt; 
&gt; After a few minutes of use, my X server (dri cvs version, mga card)

&gt; 
&gt; Unless there's any more testing I could do that will help, I'm backing

I'm fairly new to acpi.  I have it compiled into my
kernel, and it seems to setup fine upon boot.  I have
the appropriate entries in /proc/sys.  I compiled and
installed acpid,etc.  and all of that seemed to go
fine.  Now I guess my question is how do I use it? 
How do I set the power management options?  How do I
set it up to turn off my pc when I shut down?  Perhaps
these options aren't available as of yet. I can't seem
to find this info anywhere, and the acpi FAQ seems to
more detail the technical aspects rather than
using/seting up the features. Any help would be much
appreciated.
Please reply to me directly when you reply as I am not
on the acpi list.

Thanks,

Alex

Hi,

&gt; 
&gt; I just want the box to auto shutdown the power supply, APM did this only it

If you look a little further, you will find that the only thing that APM
will do for an SMP box is the power off.  I hacked it so that MAY work.
To give it a try, you need to build APM into the kernel (i.e. don't
configure it as a module) and then boot with "apm=power-off" on the
kernel command line.

At boot time apm should print

apm: disabled - APM is not SMP safe (power off active).

I know this is tha ACPI mailing list, but I though I would stamp on
the not quite correct statement above.

Cheers,
Stephen

&gt;From what I understand, most of the linux ACPI code is dealing with the 
power-down/sleep states.

Has any work been done on some of the other features of ACPI, most 
specifically heat management? (ACPI does this, right?)

Specifically, I have a Toshiba Satellite 2540XCDT, and wish it to manage 
heat better in Linux: in Windows, it runs smooth, but in dos or linux it'll 
slow down in 30 second bursts if you overheat the processor, which doesn't 
take much.

... I'm happy to help out if anyone is working on this aspect of the spec.

oops, sorry.

&gt; Do this release include David Woodhouse's patch plus the one 
&gt; liner you 
&gt; suggested to me (AMD Irongate/MS-6167)?

Not that exact patch, but should fix that issue, yes.

As for the one-liner removing acpi_idle as the system idle handler, no it
does not include it. We used to have a cmdline option to turn this off, I'll
see if I can find it tomorrow..

Sorry about the ambiguous error message. The first one means that ACPI BIOS
support is not present. I think the other one is as we're exiting, and is of
no consequence.

I've corrected these to be more understandable (and labeled them "ACPI", so
no more confusion.)

Stephane, you should not include ACPI in your kernels. No BIOS support
renders it useless, although you may want to see if there are BIOS updates
for your motherboard, and try again. If so, you will want to get the latest
version of the ACPI code at
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm .

 I've been using happily kernel 2.3 and 2.4.0-test with
mandrake's devel acpid rpm for some time. I've never thought
of switching back to 2.2 after discovering acpi:). So thanks
a lot to all the developpers here.

 Now some time ago acpid started requiring the acpi

Summary of changes for this label: 9_29_00

New table initialization interfaces:
AcpiInitializeSubsystem no longer has any parameters
AcpiFindRootPointer - Find the RSDP (if necessary)
AcpiLoadTables (RSDP) - load all tables found at RSDP-&gt;RSDT
Obsolete Interfaces
AcpiLoadFirmwareTables - replaced by AcpiLoadTables

Note: These interface changes require changes to all existing OSDs

The PCI_Config default address space handler is always installed at the root
namespace object.

Linux-specific:
Export more tables and PM timer through proc/sys/acpi
Better handle PM timer rollover, and both widths

After compiling the 2.4.0-test9 kernel with ACPI enabled, and enabling the 
Interpreter and saying 'y' to CONFIG_ACPI_S1_SLEEP, and compiling the latest 
acpid..my system shuts down while booting and the power supply is turned 
off.
One out of 5 boots is succesful so I managed to get the dmesg:

SCSI device sda: 35879135 512-byte hdwr sectors (18370 MB)
Partition check:

devfs: devfs_debug: 0x0
devfs: boot_options: 0x0   &lt;-- at this stage the system shuts down
ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 0 @ 0x0000:0
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0x0000:0
        -0196: *** Error: Sleep State package elements are not both of type 
Number
ACPI: S1 supported
Mounted devfs on /dev

The system is a Dual PIII550, Gigabyte GA-6BXD with the latest bios (version 
F3), 512Mb ram, adaptec 3950U2 SCSI and an IBM 18Gb U2 HD.

Out of the few times the sytem finished booting, when I run
shutdown -g0 or halt -p the system runs the rc.0 shutdown scripts, prints 
the message 'Power Down' but the power supply is still runnin and I have to 
manually switch it off.

What does that PBLK Error Sleep State mean ?
According to the acpi_linux_howto I have all the required entries in 
/proc/sys/acpi, and runnin acpictl -p showed that acpid was running.
Any tips would be appretiated.

Summary of changes for this label: 10_20_00

Linux:
Embedded Controller driver now registers for EC OpRegion
The beginnings of battery support (we detect them on boot, that's all)

Core:
Fix for CBN_._STA issue.  This fix will allow correct access to CBN_
OpRegions
when the _STA returns 0x8.  This code will most likely change as we gain
further
understanding of Microsoft's position on this issue. 

Support to convert ACPI constants (Ones, Zeros, One) to actual values before
a package object is returned

Fix for method call as predicate to if/while construct causing incorrect
if/while behavior

Fix for Else block package lengths sometimes calculated wrong (if block &gt; 63
bytes)

Fix for Processor object length field, was always zero

Table load abort if FACP sanity check fails

Fix for problem with Scope(name) if name already exists

Warning emitted if a named object referenced cannot be found (resolved)
during method execution.

Hello,
I've got ACPI working on my HP Omnibook 2100 but I'm having a problem
getting my sound card to cooperate with it.  With ACPI enabled the ad1848
portion of the Crystal Sound card seems to want irq 11 which acpi is also
sitting on.  Is there anyway to debug why this is happening, or to switch
acpi to a different irq?

Also I wrote a while ago about battery support via ACPI.  I've had some
free time and i read up on the spec and I think i understand how battery
information should be gathered.  I would be interested in writing the code
to do it but i've never really done any kernel development before (I've
done a lot of other development...) if anyone has any pointers to
resources to get me started I wouldn't mind working on it.

Thanks,
Brendan

Hi all,

I got the new acpi driver, recompiled the kernel with ACPI Interpreter, and 
the S1_Sleep ..same old problems the machine shuts down during boot.
I recompiled the kernel using David WoodHouse's hwreg.c patch, it didn't 
give any error messages like it did with the old acpi drivers (the default 
ones that came with the 2.4.0-test kernel gave a hunk #3 error)...and chose 
S1_Sleep, the machine booted fine but I got this:

ACPI: support found
ACPI: enable failed

I tried to manually run acpid and got 'acpi support not found'.

I then recompiled the kernel using the the released driver without applying 
David's patch and without choosing S1_Sleep it gave me the same ACPI enable 
failed message.

I tried disabling PowerManagement in the BIOS I thought maybe it was 
interfering with ACPI and disabled other items in the Power Management 
section of my bios ..still nothing.
The mobo is a GA-6BXD runnin bios V.F3 (latest), this bios supports Acpi 
even though there are no entries/options in the Bios that mention ACPI.

Is it my hardware or my luck or somethin I'm missin ?

Thanks,
Mahmood

Hi,
   Interesting.  It works fine on my ASUS CUSL2 and 2.4.0-test10-pre5.
The kernel spits out:

ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0xe410:0
ACPI: S1 supported
ACPI: S5 supported

I have the kernel configured with the following:

CONFIG_PM=y
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_S1_SLEEP=y
# CONFIG_APM is not set

Mahmoud (et al.),

Please make sure you are running the latest stuff off the website (10/20)
and make sure you are using the debug version. Its more verbose error
reporting would really come in handy here.

That said, the boot messages you're referring to are a little unclear, so
they will be more readable in the next release.

Hello Andi,

please file the link to the download page next time without the trailing \dot.
Do this release include David Woodhouse's patch plus the one liner you 
suggested to me (AMD Irongate/MS-6167)?

Thanks,

Hello Mahmoud,

A fix for that issue will be in the next source release, hopefully to happen
soon. Until then, there is a patch by David Woodhouse, which, if you look in
the list archives, you should be able to locate.

I'm a little concerned because the usual symptoms of that problem are not as
severe as the ones you are describing, but try that patch to start.

Does this still happen if you don't say 'y' to S1_SLEEP?

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your fast reply.
I did try your suggestion - not saying 'y' to S1_Sleep - and the problem 
still exists.
When the S1_Sleep was on I managed to boot the kernel successfully _only if_ 
I first booted an old 2.2.16 kernel then type 'reboot'
(not shutdown) and choose to reboot the new 2.4.0-test9 with ACPI support.

Also I said before that acpid was running this was due to the fact that I 
had turned on acpid twice in my rc.d/rc.* files, however after removing the 
second acpid and rebooting and running 'acpictl -p' I got no pid, maybe that 
-0196 error is causing the daemon to crash?

I tried applying David's S5 patch but it rejected the third hunk, I think it 
needs some number tweaking between them @'s only I lack the knowledge/skill 
:)

I just want the box to auto shutdown the power supply, APM did this only it 
doesn't work with dual processors according to the linux source files APM 
should be disabled when using smp...so I guess ACPI is the only hope.
The 6BXD is the first mobo mentioned under compatable bios Gigabyte section 
in the Acpi4Linux page, I hope it ain't somethin related to my gear ..has 
anybody out there managed to run acpi with a 6bxd, dual processor, aic7xxx 
driver ?

This release no longer fails to load the ACPI namespace on my BP6.
Unfortunately, it doesn't actually manage to enable S5, which is the only
thing I really care about ATM.

It appears not to like the ZeroOp elements in the S5 package:

0000005c: Name _S5_ (\_S5_)
00000062:   Package
00000064:     0x04
00000065:     ZeroOp
00000066:     ZeroOp
00000067:     ZeroOp
00000068:     ZeroOp

This patch fixes it:

Hello Andy,

this 'new' source release plus David Woodhouse's S5 patch fixes my AMD
Irongate system!
All the cool interpreter stuff haven't worked before...

Two problems persists:

If I press the power button --&gt; sleep (4 sec delay to power down) my
system goes immediately
down :-(

My ppp connection speed (both directions) goes down below 1 KB/sec?

My system:

AMD Athlon 550
MSI MS-6167 Rev. 1.0B (AMD Irongate C4)
latest BIOS 1.6 (for Slot A T-Bird)

Linux-2.4.0-test9 (final) + Rik van Riel latest fixes

(different Andy, but...;-)

The 4 sec delay is a feature, not a bug. This is a failsafe so that the
user, independent of the OS, can still turn off the system. If the power
button is working, you should see a message on /proc/sys/acpi/events way
before 4 sec.

I don't have an answer for the PPP problem. Could you try commenting out the
pm_idle = acpi_idle at the very bottom of cpu.c and see if it persists?

Thanks -- Regards -- Andy

&gt; This release no longer fails to load the ACPI namespace on my BP6.
&gt; Unfortunately, it doesn't actually manage to enable S5, which 
&gt; is the only
&gt; thing I really care about ATM.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears not to like the ZeroOp elements in the S5 package:

Hello Intel Andy :-)

Do you know that we are an 'Intel' town, now?
Your company has acquired a chip design firm here in the south of Hamburg,
Germany.

It helps. I am currently running with ACPI and PPP!!!

But I have much fewer entries in '/proc/sys/acpi' with the interpreter than

Without ACPI it:

Well, it's impossible for the hardware by itself to do an orderly OS
shutdown, obviously. Remember the 4 sec thing is a hardware failsafe only.

&gt; But I have much fewer entries in '/proc/sys/acpi' with the 
&gt; interpreter than
&gt; without it?

This is normal. The "without" case needs more entries because that is how
the out-of-kernel interpreter (in acpid) gets its information.

With the in-kernel interpreter, the interpreter already has the data it
needs, and in this case most of the proc entries are just there as a
convenience for developers to examine or dump the tables the interpreter is
already using, to get the status of events, or tweak parameters.

Which test kernel is recommended for use with this release?  I'm
running 2.4.0-test9, and also the Woodhouse patch to the acpi
debug sources.

After a few minutes of use, my X server (dri cvs version, mga card)
locks up completely; upon killing and restarting it, the mouse
(ps/2) doesn't move.

Unless there's any more testing I could do that will help, I'm backing
out to the original acpi directory and sticking to beta testing one
thing at a time!

&gt; From: brendan burns [mailto:bburns@wso.williams.edu]
&gt; Hello,
&gt; I've got ACPI working on my HP Omnibook 2100 but I'm having a problem
&gt; getting my sound card to cooperate with it.  With ACPI 
&gt; enabled the ad1848
&gt; portion of the Crystal Sound card seems to want irq 11 which 
&gt; acpi is also
&gt; sitting on.  Is there anyway to debug why this is happening, 
&gt; or to switch
&gt; acpi to a different irq?

ACPI can't switch to a different irq. However, it can share it. However, irq
sharing only works in linux if all the requesting devices say they can
share, by setting the SA_SHIRQ flag when they do their request_irq.

&lt;looking at ad1848 code&gt;

Nope, it's not setting the shareable flag. (ad1848.c line 1936)

Maybe talk to that driver's maintainer, or just try replacing that '0' with
SA_SHIRQ and see if it locks up ;-)

&gt; Also I wrote a while ago about battery support via ACPI.  
&gt; I've had some
&gt; free time and i read up on the spec and I think i understand 
&gt; how battery
&gt; information should be gathered.  I would be interested in 
&gt; writing the code
&gt; to do it but i've never really done any kernel development 
&gt; before (I've
&gt; done a lot of other development...) if anyone has any pointers to
&gt; resources to get me started I wouldn't mind working on it.

So you've read chapter 11 from the ACPI 2.0 spec? Cool. As you can see, it's
not really that hard -- the CM battery driver just calls a control method
and parses the result. However, the spec also defines Smart Batteries. What
this means is that it probably makes sense to write a battery subsystem
driver, that handles the /proc interface support, and then data from the
control method and smart battery drivers is compiled by the subsystem
driver.

The only other resource I can think of would be the Smart Battery Forum's
site: http://www.sbs-forum.org/specs/index.html

Hi,

&gt;
&gt;Please make sure you are running the latest stuff off the website (10/20)

I was.

&gt;and make sure you are using the debug version. Its more verbose error
&gt;reporting would really come in handy here.

I am now this is what I got:

So ..wat's goin on here? It'd be nice if anybody can shed up some light here 
I feel so blind.

It looks to me as if the ACPI support in the BIOS is broken. Is there a
BIOS update available?

Hi !
This is a bug reporting, included are the output of various /proc file on
my system:
Motherboard: ASUS P2B-F with the latest bios bx2f113.awd (microcode update)
ISDN: Winbond based card (Hisax type=36)
Distribution: based on updated SuSE 6.4

The problem is that if I compile the kernel (2.4.0-test8 pre1,pre2,pre3,pre4)
with both ACPI support and ISDN support there is a conflict in irq 9.
I think ACPI first get irq 9 and then Hisax can't get it. Consequentially
Hisax doesn't work if ACPI support is enabled.
With ACPI turned off, everything works fine as with previous kernel test6
and test5 and ....
Many thanx.

after further testing the problem seems to be in IRQ SHARING.
in fact, with acpi disabled, once the hisax has got irq 9 (it is not possible 
for card type 36 to change the irq), i can load the ethernet modules
8390 and ne2k-pci for my ethernet PCI NE2000 card, but the ne2k-pci
driver also set its irq=9, so everytime i try to do:

ifconfig eth0 up

i get:

SIOCSIFFLAGS: resource temporarily unavailable

why don't add the irq parameter to the hisax winbond driver and to the
ne2k-pci driver ?

p.s.
my motherboard has pci slot 4 and slot 5 condivided and the isdn card is
on slot 4 while ethernet on slot 5.... so one may say "change your 
motherboard", but everything worked fine with previous kernels (ACPI, Hisax,
ethernet)....

Please help me.
Many thanx.

there is no need or even sense to add such parameter, as irqs are
assigned by the bios or OS for PCI type cards. The driver is supplied
with the selected irq which is normally assigned during boot by the
systems bios.
You should change the bios PCI/Pnp setup to reflect your needs.
I don't know if the Winbond driver supports IRQ-sharing, but other i4l
drivers like the HFC-PCI which I maintain allow irq sharing without any
problems even if 3 cards share it.
So please setup your bios correctly and everything will work fine.

Hello all,

The ACPI Component Architecture has continued to evolve - undergoing
extensive changes and enhancements since its first inclusion in the
2.4.0.test3 kernel. There are too many changes to list them here (please see
the changelog). The focus of our efforts in recent months has been on
completion, robustness, and performance. We have also been working on
motherboard device configuration related development (initialization) rather
than on power management policy implementation, which we will be returning
to within the next few months. We are now periodically posting the latest
ACPI CA Linux targeted release packages on Intel's developer website at
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi. The Linux packages include
ACPI CA debug versions and tools that will aid in development. We anticipate
releasing a package containing an updated initialization sequence soon. 

Regards -- Andy

Hi Everyone!

I've just recently decided to have a look at 2.4.0-test7/8 and was
fairly impressed that when I hit my power button it now begins to shut
down. (small things like that make me happy :)

The one thing it doesn't do however is to power it down at the end.
In the past I powered down with APM, but I know that my machine can be
powered off by ACPI because I tried it a long time ago with 2.2.x
(maybe you remember my 2.2.14 patch).

At a guess I think that there must be a problem with my ACPI tables in
the BIOS, as the 2.2.x version didn't have an interpreter and so (I
believe) pretty much ignored these.  Also, when I boot up it says
"ACPI: S1 supported", but not "ACPI: S5 supported".

Is there any kludge I can use to make it ignore the fact that the
tables are messed up?  I don't think it should really go into the
"real" kernel source, but I'd appreciate it if someone told me so that
I could do it to my own sources.

Oh, my board is a Chaintech CT-5AGM2 with a fairly up to date bios.

thanks

&gt; A bad/good BIOS list would also be cool, similar to SCSI and IDE

Well, the current BIOS list already comes from a database, although the
code used to generate the HTML is write-only code (so it has to be rebuilt
from the ground up). What would be needed:

 - A tool that can be run by an unexperienced user to check his system,
    with a "Submit" button
 - Some handler to accept the submitted data
 - A cgi to display this data on the web pages

Number one is something for the experts: Most users will want to run this
on their current system to check whether they should upgrade. The good
thing: On many 2.2 systems, ACPI reclaim memory is never reclaimed, so it
should be possible to find the tables in memory. TODO:
 - Search the memory for the tables
    Problem: The memory is not available to userspace. You will have to
    insert a kernel module that briefly adds the memory to the list of
    accessible pages, does the search and removes the memory again.
 - Send the data to userspace
 - Do a set of validity checks
 - Offer to send subsets of the data back here for inclusion in the
   database
    Question: What subsets? Is there a possible problem (read: privacy or
     copyright) if we send too much data?

There is some code from Max's early experiments which does the first part,
however for older 2.2 and 2.0 kernels which didn't have e820 support and
thus mapped the tables like normal memory AFAIK.

Numbers two and three are easy if you've ever used perl and DBI. :-)

Hi all,

I recently returned from Sea Launch homeport and already made a new patch :))

This patch fixes bothering problem with ACPI interpreter Makefile.

Without this patch ACPI interpreter will unconditionaly recompiled 
every kernel build.

Hope it will be usefull.

Hi Andrey,

It's cool to see this getting some attention.

Just so you know, it looks like you may have accidentally also included some
other code changes in the patch.

APM and ACPI can not coexist.

Currently Linux ACPI has experimental support for S1 (the lightest sleeping
state), which, at least on my machine, leaves the PS on. S3 support does
turn the PS off, but most desktop mobos don't support this, and neither does
the code yet, and both these things have to happen for S3 support.

Anybody know if  the latest acpi code supports  shutting down the power
supply (or putting it some kind of "low power" mode) on suspend?
So far I've got  APM to do everything I wanted in  the way of suspend,
except the power supply fan is still on and it's pretty annoying. 
Jamming  the P/S  fan with a  pen works (the  machine becomes
completely silent!) but the P/S gets pretty hot after a while..
My motherboard manufacturer tells me APM will not power down the P/S on
suspend, so I guess I really need ACPI. Another question: if the linux
ACPI drivers  _do_ support  this feature, can  I install  them without
sacrificing all the gains I've  made with APM? In otherwords, can ACPI
and APM coexist?  
Thanks,

Dear ACPI experts,

I'm having problems with the sound IC of my IPC Topnote G notebook.
This notebook consequently uses ACPI, the I/O superchip's power is
switched off until initialization: I had to flash an old BIOS to
get access to the ports.

In principal, my sound chip is working, with ALSA as well as with
the kernel sound driver. All devices, mixer and tools are working.
I can hear something - but very faint, and only with earphones.

So my question is: could someone please interpret the following
status, does the D0 state indicate that the audio AC part has power?

# lspci -vv -d1102:*

If not, what could I do to switch the power line on?

I have a Toshiba Portege 3015CT laptop and the screen turns off after
30 minutes of not typing or moving the built in mouse.  (The USB

Is acpi up to being able to tell the display not to shut off?  That
and it would be nice for me to tell it to shut off now, but being able
to tell it not to shut off would be good enough for me for now.

The screen has the backlit display and the actual updating the lcd

Hi,

We're having some trouble with the new network card currently, which led
to some downtime today. ATM everything seems to be running (with the old
board), but I still want to get the new card to work, so I may have to
reboot a few more times. The plan is to use a different kernel version
than 2.2.17 now.

Also, there will be another power shutdown in the uni on October 1st,
we've been told (but no exact time or list of affected buildings for now).

I hope the system will be stable again after that. I'm keeping four
backups of everything and we have two backup MXes (which will AFAIK be
generator powered on October 1st), so no data gets lost and mail will
still be accepted.

(CC-ing acpi-linux)

I think acpi's use of module_init etc. was based on APM's similar use of it,
but I'm not sure. Andy H?

Right now, nothing can be modularized. It's broken into separate directories
simply because it is big. We will have drivers (EC, battery, others) that
use the interpreter that will be modularizable, but those aren't fleshed out
yet.

I prefer having directories, but would eliminating them solve its current
linking and dependency issues? Or could mkdep.c be enhanced to handle this?
(Just brainstorming here ;-)

[Andrew Grover &lt;andrew.grover@intel.com&gt;]
&gt; I'm specifically interested in the acpi driver. There's a fix in
&gt; test9-preX so that it doesn't compile all the time, but it still
&gt; *links* all the time, and that was as good as I could get it.

I'm confused here.  Can acpi be modularized?  I ask because according
to arch/i386/config.in it cannot -- yet you have module_init()
functions in arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c and drivers/acpi/driver.c.

Can you post a coherent description of which files/directories can be
built into which modules and what must actually go in the kernel?  Can
it *all* be modularized?  Can just the interpreter?  What?

&gt; do you all think there's a solution under the current build system,
&gt; or will there be, or what? ;-)

We'll see.  I imagine it won't be too tough, but then that's what I
always say.

Chris,

Well, those features are on the top of everyone's want list, but we're still
working on infrastructure. The ACPI interpreter is complex. It replaces not
only APM, but also PNPBIOS and the MPS (multiprocessor spec). Also, all the
drivers may need to be modified to save information on suspend. 

As for the eventual benefits of ACPI over APM - lower battery consumption
due to smarter power management policies, more reliability and
configurability. The commonly used example on Windows for OS power
management is that presentation apps can specify that the screen not blank.
This was impossible under APM. My personal favorite is being able to
configure the lid and power buttons to do different things.

That's what we're working towards...;-)

Ceache,

Glad to hear you're interested! ;-)

Like I said, a lot of functionality is waiting for the interpreter to
stabilize. So, any testing of it on various machines helps that. Also, there
are a things not dependent on this that would be great for you (or anyone
else) to help with. The big one is adding power management support to all
the drivers. Some of them have had this added (e100b, keyb, mouse, more?)
but suspend support requires ALL of them have it added. I think there's a
doc in the kernel source that talks about how to do this. A bad/good BIOS
list would also be cool, similar to SCSI and IDE modules.

Check out http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/ and
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi, if you haven't already.

&gt; Right now, nothing can be modularized.

OK, that's what I needed to know.  #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt; and so
forth is what was confusing me, but I realize these things are quite
valid for in-kernel-only code.

&gt; I prefer having directories, but would eliminating them solve its
&gt; current linking and dependency issues? Or could mkdep.c be enhanced
&gt; to handle this?  (Just brainstorming here ;-)

Separate directories shouldn't be a problem.  I'm currently thinking
about this issue.  One problem I think I've found is in
drivers/Makefile:

  ifeq ($(CONFIG_ACPI),y)
  SUB_DIRS += acpi
  MOD_SUB_DIRS += acpi
  endif

(1) This should be $(CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER) not $(CONFIG_ACPI).
(2) The MOD_SUB_DIRS is not needed (but mostly harmless and makes it
    easier to modularize parts later).

I'm still looking at drivers/acpi/* for other make issues (haven't had
too much time lately).

Jack,
 
I'm thinking that msg is coming from this code, at drivers/acpi/sys.c line
90:
 
if (ctx-&gt;state != ACPI_S1) {
  printk(KERN_ERR "ACPI: S%d failed\n", ctx-&gt;state);
  goto out;
 }
 
This code appears to always print that message when not going into S1. This
is obviously wrong, and not a BIOS problem on your end. I'd bet this code
gets fixed soon ;-)

class=847170001-29092000&gt;This code appears to always print that message when not 
going into S1. This is obviously wrong, and not a BIOS problem on your end. I'd

Subject: ACPI on ASUS A7V
User-Agent: Mutt/1.2.5i

Hello,

I ran into a few problems trying to enable ACPI support on my
computer. The motherboard is an Asus A7V (for socket A processors)
using the VIA Apollo KT133 chipset. The kernel I used is 2.4.0-test8.

When ACPI interpreter support was enabled, the computer hung while
booting. I had disabled CONFIG_ACPI_S1_SLEEP. The last lines of output
were:

ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0xe410:6
ACPI: C2 supported
ACPI: S1 supported
ACPI: S5 supported
VFS: Mounted root ...
Freeing unused kernel memory: 176k freed

Without the kernel ACPI interpreter, the machine booted fine. Relevant
output is:

Linux version 2.4.0-test8-acpi (root@krikkit) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian \
GNU/Linux)) #1 Fri Sep 29 12:48:11 CEST 2000  BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 @ \

[snip]
ACPI: "ASUS" found at 0x000f6730

The output of acpidmp is attached. acpid (version 052200) then crashed
the computer. I couldn't get the output of acpid -dt because it wasn't
written to disk in time (is there a way to redirect output
unbuffered?). The output of acpid -d was:

# acpid -d
acpid: started
acpid: ACPI Subsystem version [Sep  6 2000]
acpid: FACP loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/
acpid: DSDT loaded from /proc/sys/acpi/

acpid: S2 not supported
acpid: S3 not supported

acpid: S5 SLP_TYP (0x0707)
P_BLK 1 @ 0x3410:6
(debug) ACPI C2 works
ACPI C3 works

The lines "ACPI C{2,3} works" appear to come from the kernel.

If there is anything else to test, please tell me.

Robert
