Hello.

This is my first message in the list, so I'll introduce myself: My name is
Javier, and my nickname graffic :) I'm from Spain and these days I'm
investigating some strange behaviour with irssi.

And with the first message.... a strange line of code found:
File: irc/core/irc-servers-setup.c
Function: sig_server_setup_fill_chatnet
Code:
if (ircnet-&gt;nick != NULL) g_free_and_null(conn-&gt;alternate_nick);

With this line, when I connect for the first time to the servers, I don't
have an alternate nickname. then irssi tries to build a new nickname (in a
wrong way, but that's a topic for another mail).

What's the use of that line?

Thanks :)

I've maintained these patches to irssi in my personal branch for some
time and thought it was time to contribute them to the mainline. I've
cleaned them up and generated them against SVN trunk, so they should
apply with no problem.

irssi-account:
Display user account information in its own format (whois_auth), so
users can customize it.

irssi-activity:
Make /IGNORE work on the HILIGHT level, so you can prevent certain
users from triggering highlights.

irssi-names:
Support two new settings that control /NAMES output.
 - show_nickmode_empty determines whether non-op users' nicks are
displayed as ' nick' or just 'nick'.
 - names_nick_max_width is the maximum /NAMES column length.

irssi-target:
Support for the ircu numeric 439 (target change unavailable).

Let me know if there are any problems.

Hi everyone,

I have a suggestion about improving irssi.
It lacks unicode nicknames and tab completion.

most irc servers dont allow that anyway. do you have one that allows
them?

There is a general bug where tab completion no longer works after a
unicode character in the input bar.

BTW, irssi has many problems with /recode, including bugs with
nicklist, motd. I tested it only when locale was in utf-8  and server
was cp1251/koi8-r. Dont know, maybe its only unicode problem in irssi.

Well, a recent UnrealIRCd version added support for nick and channel
names in non-ASCII character sets.  I don't know, if it allows Unicode,
though, but even if it doesn't, that's just a matter of time.

Unfortunately, that ircd is very popular, so if irssi really lacks
support for Unicode nick names, someone probably should add it.

E.S.
