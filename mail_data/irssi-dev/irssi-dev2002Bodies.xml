Hi Folks,

I'm having trouble compiling the 'dcc-send-limiter.c' code against the CVS
snapshot I've got (20020130).  I just get a whole raft of compilation
errors - I presume these are due to it being a work in progress?

I can compile it fine against version 0.7.98.4, but I have a problem with
actually using it.  I've set the limit to 10 (I'm presuming this is
kbytes/s?).  I do a dcc send, and as soon as the remote party accepts,
irssi segfaults (reproducably - every time):

GLib-CRITICAL **: file ghash.c: line 152 (g_hash_table_insert): assertion
`hash_table != NULL' failed.
GLib-CRITICAL **: file gmain.c: line 500 (g_source_remove): assertion `tag
&gt; 0' failed.
Segmentation fault.

I'm running Debian unstable, by the way.  DCC's are fine if the module's
not loaded.  Have I missed anything?

Any one got any thoughts?

Hello.

Just tried out todays cvs snapshot (irssi-20020215.tar.gz) and started
messing with the statusbar changes..

I noticed that if you do: /statusbar prompt disable
irssi will start hogging the cpu after you hit a few keys..

The /statusbar command is pretty useless in its own form if you don't
have a /statusbar list  or so... If you have to bring up a text editor
to check what the statusbars are named, you might as well edit stuff
there..

And while trying to get my theme (isozapp, unreleased to the public
right now) ported over from bx I bumped into some things where I had to
modify the config file to get all things in there.. Is there no way to
add items from inside the theme? (Or is that too evil?)

http://tomas.ogren.pp.se/tmp/isozapp.png
Right now I'm doing that status bar by having a low-priority item which
contains a whole bunch of '-----'.. could there be a better way in the
future? (like a padding char/item ?)

Hi there,

	Just short suggestion - currently it is impossible
	use more than one /ignore for cases like:
	
	/ignore -pattern "blah blah" * ALL
	/ignore -pattern "b00m b00m" * ALL
	
	Second one will replace first one, but (IMHO) different
	patterns should be recognized as different ignores.

Hi there,

	Sometimes, extremely rarely though, I notice that ban list shown by
	/bans doesn't show _actual_ bans, sometimes it keeps old ones.
	
	And additionally - I saw it few times - I see people on the channel
	as not opped while others see them opped. Not sure though, this
	could be a server-side bug...
	
	Both problems are extremely rare so I see no way to reproduce them,
	unfortunately. When I rejoin the channel, lists and modes are
	synchronized as expected.

	Is there any way to "resync" ban &amp; modes list while on the channel,
	BTW?

Regards,
/Al

&gt; 	Sometimes, extremely rarely though, I notice that ban list shown by
&gt; 	/bans doesn't show _actual_ bans, sometimes it keeps old ones.

Might be a server bug, or maybe it's just telling about the bans in some
weird ways (eg. OPN's +q vs +b % mode which irssi doesn't support properly).

&gt; 	And additionally - I saw it few times - I see people on the channel
&gt; 	as not opped while others see them opped. Not sure though, this
&gt; 	could be a server-side bug...

It is, it's called channel desync. Happens mostly with laggy servers.

&gt; 	Is there any way to "resync" ban &amp; modes list while on the channel,
&gt; 	BTW?

Not currently, but 0.9 will have /ban -sync

  I am quite sure this is not the case - no special modes used (this happens

  Well, so what about resyncing of modes/ban lists on every /names, /mode or /ban
  commands, instead of special flags? Anyway data are transferred, so why not
  update internal structures as well? Just an idea :)

&gt; I noticed that if you do: /statusbar prompt disable
&gt; irssi will start hogging the cpu after you hit a few keys..

Well, input line is part of it so it's not very good idea to remove it :)
That CPU eating is because irssi tries to wait for the input line to come
back before reading any data from terminal, and that function is called all
the time. Could be fixed with some kludgeing but I don't think it's really
worth it.

well, first i wasn't going to do this but oh well :) /statusbar prints now a
list of all bars, and /statusbar &lt;name&gt; prints bar info.

Sort of evil i guess :) You should be able to change the look of statusbar
items from theme, but anything else belongs to config file.

hmm. padding char. maybe. i'll put in todo :)

On 16 February, 2002 - Timo Sirainen sent me these 1,4K bytes:

Well, it's an easy, reproducable way to hang irssi... I suppose more
people will do it and report it as a bug (since it is ;)

Maybe list disabled ones too, but with "disabled" noted.. ? Otherwise
you'd have to dig into the config file again..

&gt; 
&gt; Sort of evil i guess :) You should be able to change the look of statusbar
&gt; items from theme, but anything else belongs to config file.

Mm.. but my problem is that the default statusbar define contains too
few items to accomplish what I want.. (need the --- padding and
something that will definately end up on the far right side).

&gt; &gt; http://tomas.ogren.pp.se/tmp/isozapp.png
&gt; &gt; Right now I'm doing that status bar by having a low-priority item which

&gt; 
&gt; hmm. padding char. maybe. i'll put in todo :)

Maybe add an item that ends up to the far right (could be blank by
default).. Explanation:
Right now the -- more -- thing ends up to the far right even if you want
it or not.. It would be nice to be able to put something in the theme
that will be at the end no matter what.. (like my [=] thingies at the
ends)


Another thing that I noticed now is that the config file supplied with
irssi could be nice if it had been run through irssi once (load + save)
so it's in the same format as the user config file will be.. so it's
easier to diff and see what you have changed (to hand out to friends)..

.. and maybe add a GIMPnet server define? (the net where Gimp, Gnome etc
lives).. Would be same config stuff as EFNet but irc.gnome.org as
server..

not that important I'd say, and it doesn't crash ;)

&gt; Maybe list disabled ones too, but with "disabled" noted.. ? Otherwise
&gt; you'd have to dig into the config file again..

I'll leave this after 0.8.0 as well, since it's not too simple to do. First
I was going to make the /STATUSBAR only do a few simple things so most
people wouldn't need to touch the config file directly.

&gt; Maybe add an item that ends up to the far right (could be blank by
&gt; default).. Explanation:

there is. "barend", it's even after the --more--.

&gt; Another thing that I noticed now is that the config file supplied with

done.

done.

How about not letting the user do /statusbar prompt disable?

OK, right, so it didn't actually work with 0.7.98 like I remembered :) Oh
well, updated the version in irssi.org so that it works at least with
current CVS irssi.

I was wondering, if it would be possible for Timo to add some
sort of /set, with which one could specify if you want tab
completion to strip special characters (e.g. ^, _, -, and so on)
when completing the nick with a hit of tab. 

Or if this is out of the question, would someone be so kind and
guide me to the correct direction with a Perl script? ;-) I can
somewhat code Perl in order to create system scripts, but scripting
Irssi is so far out of my knowledge...

hi,

hmm i would say perl script.
maybe bc-bd could combine washnick.pl and niq.pl.
so it would be an option for it. :)
or someone writes a standalone script.

cras: would it be possible to have e.g. niq.pl completion and if it is
finished the nick would be cleaned from the special chars? some chaining
of completion scripts?

That's great - I've givven it a quick go and it seems to be working
fine.  While I'm posting, I seem to be having trouble now with the /RUN
command.  I'm using 0.7.98.20020131 and I'm getting:

Irssi: Unknown command: run

when I attempt to /run a script.  The perl module's definatly loaded.  I
can get around it by placing my scripts in autorun, so it's not a huge
problem.

Cheers,

John

&gt;   Well, so what about resyncing of modes/ban lists on every /names, /mode or /ban
&gt;   commands, instead of special flags? Anyway data are transferred, so why not
&gt;   update internal structures as well? Just an idea :)

Currently /names doesn't transfer any data, and /ban neither - they just
print the stuff from memory.

For 0.9, I did think first that "/mode #chan b" could have resynced the
list, but the code got so messy (like handling /mode bb correctly) that I
thought it's better to put it as /ban -sync option :)

&gt; cras: would it be possible to have e.g. niq.pl completion and if it is

yeah, I think I'll need to add some kind of support for that in 0.9.

TAB completion might be broken in some commands, so irssi doesn't like

&gt; How hard would it be to add Ruby as an extension language
&gt; like perl to irssi?

Probably not very, as the core irssi doesn't know anything about perl
either. Most problematic thing would be the signal handlers, as from C side
you only get 0-6 pointers which you'd need to convert to something that ruby
understands. I don't know anything about ruby really, but I'd guess there's
some kind of objects in it? Perl uses docs/signals.txt anyway to figure out
what parameters signals get.

&gt; Is there any documentation how to do 
&gt; this except the perl documentation and the source?

Not really. I could help some though :) Anyway, if you understand how
irssi's signaling works and can get that to work with ruby then it's pretty
much done, as you'd only need to add some wrappers to functions.

Tabs have always shown up as inverse I's for me, ever since 0.7.98
And they still do in 0.8.4.

Hi,

cras and I spoke briefley on #irssi, opn, about vi mode for irssi. I thought i'd \
sketch out some ideas here so they dont get lost.

* command/insert mode. *everything* gets sent to channel/query/whatever when in \
insert mode, unless you press escape to go back to command mode. This makes /commands \
the equivalent of :ex commands. i currently have cmdchars set to ":", but i want to \
be able to toggle between insert and command mode too. pasting /'s, :'s etc will not \
be a problem with this. (set vimode)

* inline commands, like d$, dw, x, r etc for editing the command line (set viediting)

* cursor movement with h,j,k,l (set vicursors) - just personal choice, really. it'd \
be nice. would only be applicable when using vimode and having pressed escape for \
command mode :) ^ for start of line, $ for end... especially useful if you are using \
some wierd terminal with broken arrow keys (yes, i irc from a serial terminal, hp-ux \
console and a minix handheld :)

I think that's all for now, just wanted to get those written down somewhere. Comments \
welcome, although i dont have time to join irssi development as activley as I would \
like to :/

- Sophie

Remove the translation line in your config. I got the same problem but

It seems irssi crashes whenever translation is set independent of it's

Btw. what is translation for? :)

The input line doesn't have to be in statusbar named "prompt", and I'd
rather not add such kludge anyway. If it checked that the last visible input

Some background mIRC colours would make irssi blink on certain terminals. 
With some help I tracked down the source of this to be the 0x08 bit set. 

Apparently, on some terminals, including the Linux text console, and the KDE 
konsole, this bit means "blink", but on other terminals (including rxvt and 
the Linux framebuffer console) it provides 8 more shades of the same colours 
(as with the foreground colours).

This patch will when applied by default do nothing compared to vanilla irssi, 
but when activated with /set mirc_blink_fix ON, it will strip the 0x08 bit 
off the background colours. This will stop the blinking on the terminals 
which blink when the 0x08 bit is set on colours, but also reduce the amount 
of colours irssi uses on the other kind of terminal.

An easy way to check if irssi needs this patch on your favorite terminal, is 
to try the colour 4,1 ([Ctrl+C]4,1test). If the word "test" blinks, you need 
this patch.

If it doesn't blink, your terminal is not of the kind which blinks when the 
0x08 bit is set, and you shouldn't enable this patch. If you do, it will 
reduce the accuracy of colour representation even further.

Hope this will eliminate insanity and headaches caused by blinking text for 
all of you. :)

Please tell me if you have any trouble with this patch, although it's so 
trivial that technically there's probably nothing that can go wrong with it ;)

Bug report:

Running a 2.4.17 linux kernel on a Debian unstable version.
Irssi: Client: irssi 0.8.1 (20020217 1542) stable, compiled from tarball

To cause the bug:
I connect to my local ircd, identify myself as ircop and send a very long
line to a channel, then the client crash with a segmentation fault.

hi

&gt; I have noticed that the rawlog file cuts the long lines and only sends a
&gt; part, but in the channel windows appears the entire line. I have done it
&gt; wihtout ircop identification and with identifycation, in various channels,
&gt; with various characters, but always irssi crashes.
&gt; 
&gt; Only join a channel and start to send long lines, see you.


as i thought. it is the 1024 chars bug. its already fixed in cvs. :)
i send a 2200 chars line to with my irssi and it works fine.

and of course irssi cuts the msg it sends to the server. only 512 chars
are allowed. currently irssi didnt split msg by itself. use splitlong.pl

is a bit more interesting. its a protana minifon attache, as u will see
ive enclosed notes from a web site regarding this and you will see back in
the 50's it cost $340.00 so i could imagine this to be worth a bit. it
also has an original tape inside i do not know what is on this tape, but
judging by who made it and the cost of the machine, the tape could have
some important information on it. heres the note.....

 

The Minifon, developed in the early 1950s by Monske GMBH of Hanover(or by
Protona GMBH- I'm not certain), was an ultra-miniaturized, battery
operated magnetic recording device. It could not (initially at least)
record the full range of sounds and was thus limited to voice recording,
but it did offer easy portability in a very small package. The idea of
offering a pocket dictating machine was novel, since dictation had
previously been done in the office. However, it was thought that people
like salesmen could take the machine "on the road" with them. Once on the
market, the Minifon's promoters discovered that many people took advantage
of the recorder's small size to make secret recordings to be used as
evidence, as in court.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The "legitimate" use of the Minifon, as a dictating machine, was somewhat
problematical. Recordings made on regular dictating equipment were usually
letters, and thus were normally sent almost immediately to a typist. The
Minifon offered no obvious advantages over standard dictation equipment
for office use, but its developers hoped to cultivate new uses for
dictation equipment, such as stock taking in warehouses, or the use of the
machine as a substitute for note-taking by reporters, insurance adjusters,
salesmen, and others.

In its original form, the Minifon was a wire recorder, using a type of
wire medium developed by the Armour Research Foundation of Chicago and
employed in many similar devices since the late 1940s. The machine at its
introduction in 1952 had a recording time of one hour, which was
remarkably long, and weighed only about 3 pounds at a time when a typical
office dictating machine weighed upwards of 10 pounds. It accomplished
this small size and light weight in part through the use of miniature
tubes and clever mechanical design. The basic machine cost $289.50-- a
price that sounds high today but was very much in line with competing
office dictating machines.

The parent company attempted to set up distribution, sales and service
networks in the United States. It established a business office called the
Minifon Export Corp in New York, and an existing company, Harvey Radio in
New York City became the main distributor. Although smaller tape recorders
appeared at about the same time, the main competition in the voice
recording field was from an American company, Mohawk, which made a small,
battery-operated cartridge tape recorder called the Migetape. Both
products sold less than 10,000 units per year in the U.S.&lt;BR&gt;

After a few years, the Minifon was modified to use transistors and
magnetic tape, further lowering its weight and cost. By 1962 the basic
machine weighed in at only 1.5 pounds. Competition by this time had helped
bring the cost down to $249.50.

The Minifon after about 1962 was distributed by the international
conglomerate ITT through its subsidiary in the U.S., Federal Electric
Corp. A little later, distribution was taken over by the ITT Distributor
Products Division in Lodi, New Jersey. (I don't know whether these were
the same company with different names)

By the time ITT became associated with this product, it had taken on the
name of Minifon "Attache," and a new line of models and options appeared.
These included a hi-fi model, the 978H, which sold for $330.50.Usinga
two-track, 1/4 inch tape cartridge operating at 1 7/8 inches per second,
the machine claimed a frequency response of up to 12,000 Hz, plus or minus
3db.
The coming of magnetic tape did not completely displace wire. The Model
240 series of recorders introduced in the early 1960s were probably the
last wire recorders in regular production. The 240L, at a price of $269.50
used a special long-playing wire cartridge that held 4 hours of wire.
Otherwise it looked like both the tape model and the 240S, which used a
2-hour wire cartridge and sold for $249.50.

Another innovation was the introduction of more conventional recorders.
After years of offering only "half" of a complete dictation system,
Minifon finally developed a restyled, non-portable "office" machine,
mainly for use by a transcriber, with pedal controls.

By the mid-1960s, Minifon was trying to market its machines as
multi-purpose devices suitable for nearly any recording need. In addition
to the hi-fi and long-playing machines, the company offered an astounding
variety of optional equipment such as foot controls, microphones, external
amplifiers and loudspeakers, headsets, external power supplies, telephone
recording attachments, conference recording adapters. One of the most
interesting options were the miniature microphones intended to allow users
to make "spy" recordings. In addition to a small tie-clip microphone, the
Minifon could be equipped with a microphone disguised as a wrist- watch.

Hi.

I am using irssi 0.8.4 (20020313 0430).

The documentation says:

  /WINDOW GOTO #NUMBER
     - Moves into the specified window.

  /WINDOW GOTO #CHANNEL|NICK|=NICK 
     - moves you to the window with the channel, query or 
       dcc chat.

In my experience, only numbers are accepted. For example, if I have
the following window:

  Ref Name                 Active item     Server          Level
  [..]
  14                       steve           foo             

"/window goto 14" works, but "/window goto steve" doesn't.

Regards,

Hugo

Well, guess we'll have to roshambo for it.

Hello

How hard would it be to add Ruby as an extension language
like perl to irssi? Is there any documentation how to do 
this except the perl documentation and the source?
Interfacing Ruby and C is quite easy so the main
problem is the lack of documentation of irssi.

&gt; Hi.

Heya.

&gt; I am using irssi 0.8.4 (20020313 0430).

Mine is 0.8.4.CVS.20020427-(2353).

&gt; The documentation says:
&gt; 
&gt;   /WINDOW GOTO #NUMBER
&gt;      - Moves into the specified window.
&gt; 
&gt;   /WINDOW GOTO #CHANNEL|NICK|=NICK 
&gt;      - moves you to the window with the channel, query or 
&gt;        dcc chat.

Yup, and that's how it works, too. In my Irssi, at least; just tested
it. Created a query with a person, switched to some other window and
typed '/window goto &lt;nick&gt;' and Irssi goes straight to that query
window. 

&gt; In my experience, only numbers are accepted. For example, if I have
&gt; the following window:
&gt; 
&gt;   Ref Name                 Active item     Server          Level
&gt;   [..]
&gt;   14                       steve           foo             
&gt; 
&gt; "/window goto 14" works, but "/window goto steve" doesn't.

    Ref Name                 Active item     Server          Level
    [snip...]
    18                       ekhie           IRCNet

Works fine. I'd suggest upgrading to the most recent CVS version, and
try if it works, because I don't have any idea whatsoever why this
feature doesn't work in your Irssi. I'd remember reading from some
FAQ, that "Before you complaing about a bug, try upgrading to the
most recent version", or something to that matter. :-)

So, fetch the the CVS sources and compile yourself a brand new Irssi
and let us know if it's still not functioning. Weird problem, because
it works fine here. OTOH, I haven't even used '/window' very much,
as I've bound all the windows I need to M-&lt;number&gt;. Anyway, try the
newest sources and see if it starts to work. Otherwise, I have no
ideas nor any clue why this is so. Good luck!

Oh yeah! I didn't come to think this at all. My apologies for the
misinformative mail I wrote; about "upgrade your Irssi to the
latest CVS version" and that kind of shit. It didn't occur to me
at all, that the space after tab completed nick would screw it up.

I expect, that Timo is going to fix this soon, right? One more to
the wishlist... :-)

I downloaded irssi 0.8.4 stable (sources). I compiled and installed it and 
all was ok. However, when I try to start irssi, I obtain a segmentation 
fault. I think the cause is my config file, because if I delete the 
.irssi/config, irssi starts normally, and with other users there are no 
problem. With my older client, irssi 0.8.1, I used this .irssi/config without 
problems.

I use GNU/Linux Debian testing, linux kernel 2.4.18.

The bactrace:

On Sunday 24 February 2002 04:13, escribiste:

&gt; hi
&gt;
&gt; would you send me the line you send to your ircd ?
&gt; as attachment :)
&gt;
&gt; otherwise the mail client maybe shorten it.
&gt;
&gt; thx in advance.
&gt; i will try to reproduce it then.
&gt;
&gt; runnning hybrid ircd 7b10/ircnet ircd 2.10.3/unreal ircd 3.2b6 here :)
&gt;
&gt; let me see what irssi makes crashing.
&gt;
&gt; btw. if you reproduce it for your self do a "/rawlog open ~/rawlog" before
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; darix

I have noticed that the rawlog file cuts the long lines and only sends a
part, but in the channel windows appears the entire line. I have done it
wihtout ircop identification and with identifycation, in various channels,
with various characters, but always irssi crashes.

Only join a channel and start to send long lines, see you.

I was connect to efnet, and my irssi client crashed when I typed

What could be the cause of this?

I hope it will be useful :)

PD: This is my third "bug" report, lol

&gt; I was connect to efnet, and my irssi client crashed when I typed 
&gt; /ctcp * xdcc list ¶
&gt; 
&gt; What could be the cause of this?

/ctcp * goes to active channel/query, and you didn't have either in the
active window. This bug is fixed in cvs.

I was trying my local ircd with irssi and I have discovered that if I 
identify myself like oper and send a very long line to a channel, the irssi 
client crashes with a segmentation fault.

irssi version: 0.8.1 (20020217 1542)
ircd version: 2.8/hybrid-6.2(20010925_1)

I have the core dump if you need too.

That's all :)

hi

core is always good. but read
http://irssi.org/index.php?page=documentation&amp;doc=crash

&gt; I have the core dump if you need too.
i add to my bug reports the backtrace generated with.

"gdb /path/to/bin/irssi /path/to/core &gt; bt-`date -uIs`"

anyway i think you use 0.8.1 stable?
there is a bug, already fixed in cvs, for a problem with too long lines
in irssi. maybe you should try this. but save a copy of your current
irssi binary for debugging.

hope this helps a bit.

Irssi is really great.. but I'm missing scripting features to 
the proxy module to make cool scripts where irssi interacts 
with the remote client.

1. command sending raw text to the client
2. hook to change/stop text regulary sent from irssi to the 
client
3. hook to change/stop text sent from the client to irssi on 
the way to irc

with that you could control many irssi things from the remote 
client, like ignore, away logs ...

is there any way to get text in the statusbar instead of hidden items?
say i want a base layout like

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

or something and i want items to simply pop up when available, e.g.:

+------[act: 2,3]------------------------------------------[lag: 0.09]-+
+------[mail]----------------------------------------------------------+

is this possible?

you want it always in those locations? .. a bit difficult, but could be done
if you used perl scripts to do all those items, so that they always exist
but just print empty space when they're not used.

I've started work on a Python module for irssi, more for educational
purposes than anything else. So far, I can load python scripts from
~/.irssi/python/ which have access to the irssi SERVER_REC. I'm only
working on it in my spare spare time, so don't expect it for a while. :)

Anyway, I have a few questions about irssi internals, which I'm still
pretty fuzzy on:

I don't have irssi-signal handling working quite yet. The main thing in
the way is that I need a good way to recognize the type of each
structure pointer (server, window, reconnect, etc.) and map it to the
python wrapper object I've written for it. I haven't quite parsed out
yet how the Perl module does this yet; what's the easiest way to go
here?

What kind of relationships (inheritance, delegation, etc.) should I try
to set up between the various irssi objects? For example, I haven't
quite figured out whether SERVERs should be considered subclasses of
SERVER_CONNECTs, vice versa, some form of containment/delegation, or
none of the above. Any advice here would be appreciated.

Thanks for your help.

Greetings,

Just installed RedHat 8.0 to give it a look, and as I didn't find irssi with
its packages, I've download the irssi 0.8.5 tarball.

Configuration was ok, compilation too.

But after installing irssi, and trying to launch it, it segfault just after
clearing the screen -makes me wonder if the problem wouldn't be in ncurses?-

Is this a known issue ?

Should I try the current CVS code ?

Thanks for any hint.

Some info :

[shaman@m214 irssi-0.8.5]$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.2 20020903 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7)
[shaman@m214 irssi-0.8.5]$ rpm -qi ncurses

Hello!


Maybe this comes a bit late for 0.8.5, but with this version some of
my scripts stopped working.  Anything which binds to dcc events seems
to cause irssi to crash on incoming dcc connections.

   Irssi::signal_add('dcc created', 'ag_sig_dcc_created');


Did I miss some changes?  Did the dcc_rec change?  The docs don't
mention anything about that.  I'm sure there is a trivial solution I'm
yet too dumb to find.

Regards,
Sascha

Perl uses docs/signals.txt and generates perl-signals-list.h from it, using

They're not inherited too much. Mostly just IRC (and other protocol) objects
inherit the core objects. Then CHANNEL_REC and QUERY_REC are inherited from
WI_ITEM_REC. I'm not sure if there was others. You should be able to see
these by looking if there's #include inside structure definition.

SERVER_REC contains connrec which points to SERVER_CONNECT_REC, but I don't
think it should be considered inherited or anything.. or .. um.. well.. :)
Looks like my perl code just merges the server and server_connect into one
perl object. I probably did it just because it was easier that way to use,
guess you should too :)

I'd like to see this implemented very much, too! I think I once asked
about this in #irssi (@ IRCNet), but I'd remember that in response I
only got disappointed sighs from Emacs-advocates. ;^)

Hehe, no -- seriously, if someone is working on this one, let us know!
It's getting harder and harder for me to type stuff in irssi, as I've
got so used to home row (by Vim itself, and shell, too). :-)

Maybe in the future, each _REC could include a field with a magic number

If a rewrite is consitered, it might make more sense to shift to
GSignals (as they no longer depends on gtk+ byt only glib). Rather than
adding introspection to the existing system.

Python allready has exelent support for GSignals.

There's one problem with that - the string type. I'd rather keep all strings
in regular char*s than put them into some structure which gets passed around
in signals..

Actually, the rewrite won't use glib at all :) Also, GSignals is annoying in
the way that it requires each signal to be registered. But .. hmm. maybe
that registeration wouldn't be that bad :) "event xxx" are problematic since
it depends on server what events it sends, but I could just register them
all at once by saying "all signals beginning with 'event '".

Oh, and GLIB signals aren't powerful enough for irssi anyway. At least they
weren't in 1.2.x.

&gt; Oh, and GLIB signals aren't powerful enough for irssi anyway. At least they
&gt; weren't in 1.2.x.
&gt; 

Not powerfull enough? How so?

I won't be insulted or anything, I just figured GSignals would be nice
as they are easily marshalled into perl (or python if you're into that
kinda thing).

&gt; I'd like to see that feature implemented very much. Any estimates on when it
&gt; may happen? :&gt;

I guess it's waiting for someone motivated enough to code it? :) I
almost started it one day, but then noticed it wasn't as easy as I
thought..

I think it should be implemented so that there would be possible to have
multiple keyboard states each having their own bindings, then some
commands to switch between the states. vi-keys could be implemented with
configuring two of these states. It's just that the current way it's
done requires quite a lot of changes to support multiple states..

It's in CVS now. "no_connect" flag.

Hi there,

I'm looking into MIT Zephyr support into irssi, by writing a plugin
module, since my goal is to reduce the number of instant messaging
clients that I have to run.   

The problem I have is that Zephyr is datagram based, not TCP stream
based, and near as I can tell, the work of opening up a TCP stream is
done in the high-level code.   

What would be the easy way to bypass the net_connect code, so that it
necessary protocol exhcnages could be done in the low-level CHAT
protocol module.  There is still the concept of "connecting" to the
zephyr realm, so it makes sense to use /CONNECT to login to a Zephyr
server.  It just doesn't involve a TCP connection.

Thanks!!

						- Ted

a) It's rather irssi-users-related question.

b) my $server = Irssi::server_find_tag("ircnet");
   return unless $server;
   my $channel = $server-&gt;channel_find("#TheChannel");

I'm not sure if you're intentionally looking for a console method but I'd
suggest looking into gaim (http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) for a
multi-protocol IM client. You might also want to look into bitlbee
(http://www.lintux.cx/bitlbee.html), though I don't know anything about
that as I haven't used it.

hmm if you make advertisments for other programs:
centericq &lt;http://konst.org.ua/centericq&gt; is quite nice.

but i think it shouldnt be this hard to add udp based protocols to
irssi. see the icq plugin or irssiq.pl. both implement icq protocol
which is mainly udp based. maybe the plugin source is a good starting
point or is there a perl module for MIT Zephyr?

just my pi cents

No, I definitely want a console based program.  Part of the problem is
that I hate the UI of all of the X based clients I've seen to date
(and this includes gaim).  IRSSI is the first IM-style client I've
found whose interface hasn't sucked.

Also, I want to be able to run a single instance of a console-based
messaging client under screen, and then attach to it from multiple
locations (depending on whether I'm upstairs at my development
station, or downstairs at my laptop, etc.)

Your mention of Gaim brings up an interesting point, though.  It would
be really cool we could reuse IM-protocol drivers from other clients;
I've often wondered why there hasn't been a standard ABI/API defined
so that multiple clients could dynamically load protocol modules.  

Gaim does support an impressive number of protocols that I'm
interested in, including jabber. I wonder how hard it will be to write
a generic irssi plugin which interfaces with an gaim protocol module.
Hmm....

&gt; but i think it shouldnt be this hard to add udp based protocols to
&gt; irssi. see the icq plugin or irssiq.pl. both implement icq protocol
&gt; which is mainly udp based. maybe the plugin source is a good starting

Errr... I started my work by passing it off the icq plugin, in the
absence of a "how to write your own protocol module" documentation, or
an example framework module which only had the irssi glue and had a
"drop in code to connext here".  (Wishlist: having either would make
it a lot easier for developers to add support for new protocols).

However, having looked at the irssi-icq sources, it appears to have
implemented a TCP-based protocol, unless I'm completely misreading the
code.  (There's not a single send/sendto/recv/recvfrom in the entire
source; it's calling net_connect(), and net_sendbuffer_send().)

an command bind in irssi gets the  following 3 parameters
Irssi::command_bind 'foo' =&gt; sub { 
    my ($data, $server, $windowitem) = @_;
}

if you call /foo in the target window with the channel as aktive item
you just could do 
$windowitem -&gt; command ("say $data");
# $data == parametes to the /foo command

otherwise you could use 
if ( ref ($windowitem) == 'CHANNEL' ) {
    $server-&gt;command ("msg $windowítem-&gt;{'name'} $data");
}

hope this helps a bit.

Hi,

I'm developing an irssi script that uses the following modules:

POSIX
Fcntl
Digest::MD5
DBI
DBD::Pg
Carp

On /quit (when I used my script once) irssi dumps core by segfault. 
Here's a backtrace:

(gdb) bt
#0  0x2846948c in ?? ()
#1  0x80fdb25 in S_call_body ()
#2  0x80fd91a in Perl_call_sv ()
#3  0x81481d9 in Perl_sv_clear ()
#4  0x814879d in Perl_sv_free ()
#5  0x8142768 in do_clean_objs ()
#6  0x81426dd in S_visit ()
#7  0x81427fe in Perl_sv_clean_objs ()
#8  0x80fb55b in perl_destruct ()
#9  0x80f3a92 in perl_scripts_deinit () at perl-core.c:166
#10 0x80f49ed in perl_core_deinit () at perl-core.c:467
#11 0x807f3c9 in textui_deinit () at irssi.c:213
#12 0x807f7a6 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbfbff6b4) at irssi.c:375
#13 0x8069077 in _start ()

I played a bit with the code and it seems to me that 
perl_scripts_deinit(void) contains the problem. 

I don't understand what the following code should provide what 
perl_destruct() not already does for us:

/* Unload all perl libraries loaded with dynaloader */
perl_eval_pv("foreach my $lib (@DynaLoader::dl_modules) { if ($lib =~ 
/^Irssi\\b/) { $lib .= '::deinit();'; eval $lib; } }", TRUE);

perl_eval_pv("eval { foreach my $lib (@DynaLoader::dl_librefs) { 
DynaLoader::dl_unload_file($lib); } }", TRUE);

Clearly I should clean up modules loaded dynamically by DynaLoader 
(first Irssi, then the rest) but won't perl_destruct() do that
automatically for us? If I comment out the second perl_eval_pv line,
irssi stops segfaulting on /quit.

The DynaLoader documentation doesn't mention any special cleanup magic 
that needs to be done (with a few exceptions).

I tried the above with perl 5.6.1 and "perl, v5.8.0 built for 
i386-freebsd". Irssi is configured with "CFLAGS=-g ./configure"

Please comment on that.

This sounds like a good plan to me.

In the mean time, what I'm doing is to work like C does. Signals that
python code receives pass along up to 6 PyCObjects, which are just
wrappers around void *'s. Then, the signal functions "casts" them using
functions from the irssi module to the correct type. I've only tested
this with the Server type (since that's all I've implemented so far) but
it seems to be working.

Hmmm, there's no reason that until signal_register is in the core, it
couldn't be a python function that assists in automatic type selection.

Hi,

I have three things i'd like to see fixed in irssi...
Two of them are theme related, one is scripting related.

1) I'd like to see a special variable that holds the nick of the person
one has in query, so I can use that in my themes for queries. Example:

Public:
| &lt;Fluor&gt; my own public message
| &lt;John&gt; someone elses public message

And private message:
| (-&gt;John) this is a private message to john
| (&lt;-John) John replied in private

And queried:
| (:Q:-&gt;Fluor) This is a private message to john in a query
| (:Q:&lt;-John) John replied in the query

This query format differs. I can't get it to show 'John' on both lines
so I can use my &lt;- and -&gt; 'theme' as I use in private messages...
So i'd like it to show: 

| (:Q:-&gt;John) blabla
| (:Q:&lt;-John) what blabla?

on the first line just as if I were private-messaging with John and not
using a query.  At this moment this seems impossible. Correct me if i'm
wrong.

2) Another theme thing. I'd like to be able to set the way my own
actions look like, and seperate public actions from private ones.
Right now I have:

| Own public action
| * Fluor says hi!
| Own private action in a query
| * Fluor says hi!
| John's public action
| * John waves
| John's private action in a query
| (:Q:) * John waves

I'd like to have:

| Own public action
| * Fluor says hi!
| Own private action in a query

There is a 'pubaction' which formats public actions by others, and
there's 'ownaction' which formats my own actions. Then you have
'pvtaction_query', that formats actions sent in private by others.
But there's seems not to be a 'ownpvtaction_query' setting.

Then the last thing:

3) Scripting. I really would like to have a (list of) channel(s) on
'message quit' signals. At this moment I can't tell what channel(s) the
user quitted. It would be great if $channel would contain something like
a comma seperated list of channels the user quitted from. I need this
for scripts that need to act on quits but not on all channels. This
seems impossible, correct me if i'm wrong. $target holds no value.

Kind regards,
Sander Smeenk
Happy irssi user

&gt; &gt; you want it always in those locations? .. a bit difficult, but could be done
&gt; &gt; if you used perl scripts to do all those items, so that they always exist
&gt; &gt; but just print empty space when they're not used.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; ok...so one would monitor for statusbar related signals and update

I guess this is the solution for showing topics on 2 rows too?

&gt; Not powerfull enough? How so?

There's only two "priorities", normal and G_CONNECT_AFTER. Irssi has always
required at least 3, and nowadays it has infinite amount of them of which 4
are actually useful :)

Also GLIB's signals don't really fit into how irssi wants to use them.
They're always bound to some object, while irssi (or scripts) rarely cares
about which "object" (could be eg. server or channel) actually sends the
signal. Of course, there could always be a single object which emits all
signals but that feels somewhat nasty :)

One final thing CVS irssi has is signal_continue() for continuing signal
emission with different parameters. This is excellent feature :)

Maybe if all I did was move the signal definitions from signals.txt to
sources. Something like

signal_register("event ", "SERVER_REC", "string", "string", "string", NULL);

And maybe to prevent typos breaking things:

signal_arg_register("SERVER_REC");
signal_register("event ", "SERVER_REC", ARG_STRING, ARG_STRING, ARG_STRING, NULL);

and signal_register() would fail if it found any unregistered arguments.

Scripts could also then create their own signals using
Irssi::signal_register().
