Hello.

Recently I received an e-mail from a person interested in the i18n of irssi \
(www.irssi.org, nice irc client, mainly ircnet-centric but can be configured for \
other net's quirks).

I had actually forgotten that irssi was i18nized (by 	me, even! :) because the themes \
where all in-client text is installed was not i18nized (but thats another story) but \
a LOT because the irc server sends text in english!

Note that I'm not trying to make ircd do some sort of babelfish translations, i'm \
just suggesting an i18n of messsages such as "End of /WHOIS list."

i18n of an irc server would be a tedious process, mainly because the current code \
doesn't have any such measures, but also because an irc protocol extention would be \
needed for the client to choose their language.

I don't remember if the IRCnet ircd sends a PING before letting the client in, but \
somehow the server would have to know the language before the MOTD was diplayed. I've \
thought of several possible kludgy solutions, like ircd sending an interesting PING \
message with a LANG query integrated in the ping text. Wouldn't break any clients, \
but might break some clients with the new protocol connecting to a server which \
happens to coincide with that protocol.

That's why I thought of sending a LANG message before sending the PING. An \
i18n-supporting IRC client would respond to the LANG before responding to the PING, \
but an older client would just ignore the LANG and just reply to the PING and defualt \
to English.

Any ideas on this approach? Except that it's a bit of work, that is.

I'm CC:ing this to the irssi-dev list, because it might interest some people there \
too.

The problem with using gettext is that it expects text strings exactly
as they are.

You'd have to account for IRC servings modifying their texts to remotely
amusing or non-standard texts in English, like that on DalNet.

Also, if it was i18nized at the IRC server level, work wouldn't have to
be duplicated for i18n of replies in other clients. They would just
have to reply to a LANG request and presto, most of the IRC server
text is translated.

Sure, you could do this with numerics already, but how good is that?
The numerics namespace isn't centrally controlled. Earlier on this
list there was someone who commented on one particular horrible
numberic that could mean four(!) different things depending on what
IRC server it was.

This is the elimination of work duplication which is all that Free
Software is about anyway. Sure, the work would have to be duplicated
over several IRC server platforms, but there are less widely deployed IRC
server softwares than there are widely used IRC clients. And of course,
less work in maintenance on the IRC clients.

I'm willing to look at the ircd code and see what has to be done to
i18n it. It should only be to dig out all character array constats and
replace that with a call to something similar to GNU gettext, or even
GNU gettext itself.

As for IRC clients, the changes would be trivial, and feasible in
under 20 lines of code (even that would be bloated) unless the client
is extremely poorly designed.

Sending a ping before the client is connected is a violation of
the RFC.  It can easely break a client.

I do want some protocol that allows extentions, like this,
between client and server, or server and server.

There just isn't any "clean" way of doing it that I can think of.
The best thing so far is that a client sends some command to the
server before it registers.  But then you can have the client
waiting for the answer of the server, before it continue's, if
the server doesn't know about it.

Most servers don't generate a reply on bad commands while you
aren't authenticated yet.  If you except a reply of the server
before you can continue, this will give a problem.

Note that for this problem it wouldn't give a problem, but for
others it would.

For numeric reply's, we can probably support all possible
language.  But don't expect us to allow all possible nicknames
for instance.  We can't change much about how the protocol is
defined.

True, but now, being a practical type person, many IRC server
software, like that of Undernet already does send a PING before
connected. This IMHO is a great thing protecting against floodbots
from borken FTP servers or any other exploits that require a client
only being able to write on a socket. So, IRC clients in use now
support PING before connect.

&gt; waiting for the answer of the server, before it continue's, if
&gt; the server doesn't know about it.

That's why I proposed sending it just before a PING command. Here
are some examples. C is client, S is server.

C: USER jdoe host host :John Doe
C: NICK DowJohn
S: LANG         /* This could be some numeric. Might be better. */
S: PING :somerandomnumber

Here the server waits for a PONG.

IRC clients would generally just ignore the LANG request, which could
be a numeric, and instead just respond to the PING.

But an extended IRC client would recognise the LANG request and
respond to it, and because it programmatically came before the PING
request, it won't be properly connected yes, so no Non-english text
will have had the chance to send any non-english text yet.

Then, the IRC client, regardless of whether it is an extended client
or not would just respond to the PONG.

If the LANG was not received by the server, then it would just default
to English.

Oh, also. Without checking the RFC right now, does it actually
prohibit a PING command in the handshaking sequence before the MOTD?

&gt; language.  But don't expect us to allow all possible nicknames
&gt; for instance.  We can't change much about how the protocol is
&gt; defined.

No, I never said that we should allow foreign nicknames. Some IRC
servers allow long nick names, but that technically breaks the RFC
and even some current IRC clients that truncate the nicknames.

A side note:

Ironically though, the reason for }, {, and \ to be the lowercase
variants of ], [ and | is because of IRC's Finnish origin.

In the dark ages of 7-bit SE-ASCII, }{\][| corresponded to åäöÅÄÖ.
These letters were used in the Finnish and Swedish language.


* end of personal reply, starting general comments added on *

I received some constructive comments from pht on #c on IRCnet, pointing
out that the IRC server isn't the right place to i18nize. He pointed
out that the IRC protocol is defined as a numeric, some arguments, and
then some explanatory "garbage" text. This text is just there to speed
up the development of "half-baked" IRC clients.

I reply that that most modern IRC clients are half-baked in that aspect. I
see this as a good thing. Centralising i18n is always a good thing.

He always pointed out that menus and so and such don't get translated
with this approach. This is true, but likewise, if I translate IRC client
menu's, the responses won't change either.

He then argues that the IRC client writer should handle the numerics
and translate them himself. This is a good point, but with the
impurities in the IRC protocol, with that particular numeric which
could mean four(!) different things depending on what network you're
on, it would be too fragile. And then every IRC client writer would
have to duplicate those particular efforts. That isn't good either.
Lots of wasted time that could be better used.

I have no clue how to "exploit ftp", but it was only intended to
prevent someone from doing an ip spoof on a broken OS.

I like that idea that the server sends it first, to say it
supports that.  It should be a numeric tho.

What about sending the numeric before it sends the USER or NICK
message? (Wonder how a server will react on that.)

You could send :server XXX * YYY

XXX being a numeric everybody should agree on.

No idea what that YYY should contain tho, maybe something like
":this server supports different languages.", or a list of the
languages it knows.

At that point the client has to wait again, so I don't like it.

I don't like sending a broken ping request at all.
"somerandomnumber" is not a name of a server (or client).

The easiest sollution I see for this problem is that the client
just sends a "LANG XXXX" request before sending either USER or
NICK.  It should always work. XXXX could be a list of languages
it likes, in that order.  If non found, use a default (English,
or some compile time option.)

&gt; Oh, also. Without checking the RFC right now, does it actually
&gt; prohibit a PING command in the handshaking sequence before the MOTD?

The strongest point against the PING is that it does not use the
name of the server sending the request.

Also, the RFC does not say anything about ping in section 4.1
Connection Registration.  It's put under section 4.6 Miscellaneous
messages.

&gt; Ironically though, the reason for }, {, and \ to be the lowercase
&gt; variants of ], [ and | is because of IRC's Finnish origin.

Don't forget ^ and ~, which weren't documented in rfc1459.

The RFC does define how the numerics should look, but with some
it depends on the error it gives, or what server you're connected
to what the error message is.

One thing you forget however is that you can get reply's from
remote servers.  We would have to change the server server
protocol to be able to support it fully.  I doubt this is going
to happen.

then always add the &lt;data&gt; to the PONG reply. This wouldn't necessarily need
to work with remote servers (would be nice though), if client used "PING
:remoteserver somedata" the server could just remove the somedata part.

Then add a kludge for this to support the language selection:

Server: PING :server LANGUAGE
Old client: PONG :server LANGUAGE
New client: PONG :server &lt;language code(s)&gt;

Or if ip spoofing is still a problem it could add the random number between
server and langauge.

An proxy should just forward things, specially if it doesn't know
about those commands.

ircd should generate an ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND (421), or optionally
just ignoring during authentication, like most do.

&gt; &gt; The strongest point against the PING is that it does not use the

Now the name of the server would be "server &lt;data&gt;".  If you said
"PING server &lt;data&gt;", it's wrong too. &lt;data&gt; would have to be my
nick.  I still wonder why the server sends a "PING :server",
with ':' tho.  It's in my TODO to remove that, altho it doesn't
hurt, since no data follows that.

As client I should either send "PONG mynick", or 
"PONG mynick server"

If the server sends a "PING a", that a is the name of my server,
so I can send a "PONG mynick a", "PONG mynick myserver", or just 
"PONG mynick".
If the server sends a "PING a b", then I can assume b is my nick,
so I send a "PONG b", "PONG b a", "PONG b myserver", "PONG mynick", 
"PONG mynick a", or "PONG mynick myserver".

Note that a client can send anything for mynick, the server will
change it to the correct one.  It could easely be a fix string.

A client can choise between alot different options when to reply
to the server, and you can only wonder why so many clients had a
problem with it.

The easiest thing to do as client is send "PONG mynick a".

&gt; Server: PING :server LANGUAGE
&gt; Old client: PONG :server LANGUAGE
&gt; New client: PONG :server &lt;language code(s)&gt;

This simply won't work.

&gt; server and langauge.

It still is on certain OS's.

I mean those proxies that first let you connect inside them, then give
command to connect to real server, like "proxy server irc.funet.fi 6667". I
don't think clients have ever sent anything else to server at registration
than PASS -&gt; NICK -&gt; USER, so there could easily be proxies that fail if
they receive some weird command from client.

...
&gt; The easiest thing to do as client is send "PONG mynick a".

Oh, didn't remember PING worked like that.. I've always just sent in PONG
whatever there's after PING, seems to work fine everywhere. So, specs say
PING and PONG has one or two parameters, how about adding the data as third?
Adding parameters shouldn't break things?

&gt; &gt; Server: PING :server LANGUAGE
&gt; &gt; Old client: PONG :server LANGUAGE
&gt; &gt; New client: PONG :server &lt;language code(s)&gt;
&gt; This simply won't work.

Server: PING server nick LANGUAGE
Old client: PONG nick (or whatever other combinations)
New client: PONG nick server &lt;language code(s)&gt;

But maybe the LANG command would be better, it could even be used to change
the language while already being connected.

  Remember, PING/PONG is also used for anti IP spoofing on other nets..

Server sends "PING :random#"
client sends back "PONG "random#"


LANG command would be much better idea...

This is actually useless, there's if (!log-&gt;temp ..) a few lines up :)

&gt;  	log = logs_find_item(LOG_ITEM_TARGET, item-&gt;name, item-&gt;server, NULL);
&gt; -        if (log != NULL) log_close(log);

but this is right .. except I don't think it should stop logging either,
after rejoining to the channel wouldn't start logging again then, or if there
was multiple channels being logged to same log it wouldn't be nice to close
the log then either. so, if (log != NULL) -&gt; if (log != NULL &amp;&amp; log-&gt;temp)
is what I'll do :)

Dies ist eine mehrteilige Nachricht im MIME-Format.

Fixes automatic log closing - so irssi won't remove log entries you
want to keep forever and save in config when the log target is
closed.
