[Attachment #2 (multipart/alternative)]


Hello again! 
 
I have now compiled loop-AES on my Gentoo system (works like a charme!) and am doing \
initial tests. Have been wondering about using EVMS to manage my disks. Does anyone \
have any experience with this (good or bad). Does it work with encryption?  
I have been thinking about it and concluded that theoretically this must be the way \
to do it:  
Use EVMS to make a logical new device called for instance /dev/evms/evmdev1 or \
similar. This could be a drive linked volume, raid5 or whatever. And from this point \
start the encryption.   
Do you think this will work (I will try this in a Vmware session soon ...!)

Hi, 

i seem to have the same problem (the error message mounting /dev/hde1 as /lib 
failed). So, I read your answer Jari, and altered my bootdev and my cryptroot 
according to your suggestions (before they were set to hde1 and hda10). 
Sadly, I still get that error (now with /dev/discs/disc4/part1). Any help 
greatly needed.

Are you sure /dev/hde maps to devfs disc4?
Try this:

BOOTDEV=/dev/discs/disc1/part1

&gt; CRYPTROOT=/dev/discs/disc0/part10

This looks OK.

OK,

after some research i found out, that the paths provided by you were not 
correct (at least on my kernel/system), the correct ones are:

BOOTDEV=/dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 [this is /dev/hde1]
and
CRYPTROOT=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part10 [this is /dev/hda10]

These settings get me just a little bit further. When it tries to execute the 
losetup command, it gives the error "/dev/loop/0" not found. I already edited 
the build-initrd.sh files, to disclude the last "/", making it /dev/loop0, 
but that gave me the same result.

Any ideas ?

Are you sure that you manually copied correct loop driver to /dev/hde1
(/boot) under name loop-KERNELVERSION.o that matches kernel that you are
trying to boot?

Yes,

there is a "loop-2.4.19-gentoo-r10.o" file...and while booting i get something 
like "loop loaded (max 8 devices)". Anyhow i get the message that he couldnt 
find /dev/loop/0, and then that there was an error issueing the losetup 
command, it seems to retry this 3 times or something, then aborting. Oh, and 
yes i get a message that devfs was mounted to /dev.

OK. So losetup is unable to open device /dev/loop/0 because it doesn't
exist.

When kernel is configured with CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y, drivers register their
devices at runtime so that devfs knows about them. And in loop driver case,
loop is supposed to register above /dev/loop/0 device. That device is not
registered there as above error message shows.

One reasonable explanation is that your kernel was compiled with
configuration that had CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y, but externally compiled loop.o
module was compiled for kernel configuration that had CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=n.

What does this command output?

    nm /boot/loop-2.4.19-gentoo-r10.o | grep devfs

It should look something like this:

0000000c b devfs_handle
         U devfs_mk_dir
         U devfs_register_blkdev
         U devfs_register_series
         U devfs_unregister
         U devfs_unregister_blkdev

Your loop.o module is compiled for wrong kernel configuration
(CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=n) if it looks something like this:

0000000c b devfs_handle

I apologize in advance if this has been extensively discussed, but I'm 
curious about facts/opinions regarding the use of file-backed loop where 
the file lives inside an ext3 filesystem.  For example,  I setup 
/dev/loop3 to point to /home/rigsby/bigsecrets.dat and /home is an ext3 
file system.

Are there any concerns, advantages, or disadvantages to having the 
source file for a file-backed loop in an ext3 filesystem versus ext2?

Thanks,
&lt;/CR&gt;

hi, under mandrake's distro 9.0 :  2.4.19-16mdksecure , I get occasional
bad reads from disk into buffer. filesystem reiserfs (if that matters),

/etc/fstab:
/dev/hdd2 /mnt/pepsi reiserfs encrypted,encryption=AES,notail 1 1

it appears that the corruption is always in 17-byte chunks.
Also, the buffer stays same until it is removed and re-read.

please note that in the examples below, disk reading activities were
performed between comparisons (cmp -l), to force invalidation of the
current buffer in hopes that next read would re-read the disk and get the
copy into the buffer correctly. Sometimes it is read into the buffer
correctly, sometimes not, as can be seen from below.

through the whole experiment, the files (pepsi-semifinal-JYp*m)
haven't changed, but cmp -l has reported them differently a few times.

what's wrong ? how can this be fixed ? what do i do ?

thanks - rkelly

I have had a lot of success using the dvd+rw-tools to burn DVDs.
What I would like to ask is if there is a way to burn encrypted DVDs?
I am looking for a way to do it so I do not have to pipe an entire 
image through GnuPG. I think there may be a way to do it with the 
built in crypto in the 2.6 Kernel but I have not tried that yet. Can 
someone explain 1) how to do it and 2) Is there a way to make a
backup key so that If I burn the Encrypted DVD on one computer I can 
somehow move the Key to another computer later on and still access 
the encrypted content later if I want? Thank you

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Maybe someone can help me.
I would like to have an encrypted home directory for each user. I have created 
an encrypted partition for each user and would like to have it mounted 
automatically when a user logs in.

It would be perfect, if the home dir would be mounted with the same password 
like the user uses to log in, but for the beginning it would be good to have 
the user to login with password and again type in the password when his 
homedirectory gets mounted (encrypted file system).


I have tried everthing I could imagine, but it didn't work (I am not an 
expert). Hopefully one of you has solved this problem already and can give me 
some hints.

It should be a common problem, so please copy&amp;paste&amp;send your solution.


I am working with RH 8.0 and loop AES is working without problems so far when 
I am manually mounting the partitions. SWAP is also encrypted. 


Regards,
Robert

hi,

recently i set up a crypted filesystem and use it already successfully.
for testing purposes (and 'cause i'm lazy) i've always used the option 
"-p" when initializing the loop-device via losetup:

losetup -k 128 -p 26 -e serpent /dev/loop6 /dev/sdb2

that way, i don't have to type in the passphrase manually, instead, as i 
understood correctly, the passphrase is taken from the file located on 
inode# 26.

now i really _want_ to type in the passphrase manually. but losetup 
seems not to accept it. there is no error message like "wrong pw" or so 
but the following mount (right after losetup) is
failing, which leads me to the assuption that losetup has not recognized
the passphrase and the loopdevice was not set up correctly, hence the
mount fails.

the "-p" option is not that much documented in the manpage, am i missing
an important fact about it?

an no, and it's no typo here, the passphrase is right :-)

below is the output of some operations i took from the Loopback 
Encrypted Filesystem HOWTO and CryptoAPI doc resources. i'm new to this 
crypto-fs stuff, so maybe there is even more wrong, please have a look.

Thanks,
Christian.

Dear Sir linux-crypto ,

                                Dear Sir,

Listen and read carefully, i have found seriousness in
you and that is why i have decided to involve you in
this transaction o.k , i am  a woman of substance and
of great importance to my nation and the society in
general. i wll not entertain any act of unseriousness
from you in this transaction o.k

you must take instructions from me at all time and for
security reasons you will only communicate me only by
my email for now o.k.

I,am Mrs LOUISA EJERCITOR ESTRADA , the wife of Mr
Joseph Estrada the former president of Philippine
located in the south east Asia. My husband was
presently impeached from office by a backed uprising
of mass demonstrators and the senate.                 
                                        
During my husband's regime as president of
Philippine, I realised US$28.5millions of dollars
from various contract projects I executed
successfully. I had planed to invest this money in 
real estate and industral production.                 
                                                      
Now i have used an NGO to move the money to a bank
in overseas, i want you to assist me transfer the
money to your bank account as the beneficiary because
i do not want the philippine government to trace  and
confiscate this one. they have confiscated all our
asset. This is the only money left for me and my
family o.k
Now if you agree, i will offer you 15% of the total
fund, and you must keep it very secret and
confidential o.k. There is no risk involved, all i
want from you is , your complete name, address, bank
particulars phone and fax numbers, company name if any
and you must be honest o.k
this money will be transfered to your account as soon
as you release this requirements o.k
i look forward to having a good relationship with
you o.k
regards,

Mrs Louise Estrade

Ben:

Thanks for these patches!

I have been working on encrypted-root, with the password mangled via gpg
key pairs.

I can get everything to work (almost) with a "stock" util-linux-2.12 via
the following losetup chain:

gpg --homedir /mnt/usb/.gnupg \
~ -d /mnt/usb/.gnupg/hard-disk-keyfile.gpg | \
~ losetup -e twofish -p 0 /dev/loop/5 $DATA

This works -- *until* you try to run something like this from PID 1
(init), for example in a pivot_root set-up script at boot time. When you
do that, you don't have a TTY, and GPG will die with "can't open /dev/tty".

So I need something like Jari's lomount patch, which expands the getpass
~ functions in lomount to call GPG (with the --no-tty option, and using
xgetpass).

Is there some way to merge the two approaches? Or to use your approach
with GPG that I am missing?

Thanks!

oh, well, --&gt; what? who did such a thing to losetup? "reading from an 
open file descriptor", i guess it could not be made any more complicated.
hm, ok, now that i've got this it i found out that it was really set to 
an empty password. ouch!

the manpage of "losetup" said:

--pass-fd, -p num
   read the passphrase from file descriptor num instead of the terminal.

i was not familar to this "#&lt;/path/to/file" thing yet.

&gt;&gt;(undefined encryption?)
&gt; 
&gt; undefined == CryptoAPI

ah, ok.

Thank you very much for this quick response!

I'm trying to recompile util-linux source under a sarge
dist and it's failing. Same source as I used only days
ago so I suspect something in an upgrade caused the problem.

I've used source both from upstream and via apt-get. The
only thing that changes is in which .c the error shows
up first. The below is from upstream sourceL

cc -pipe -O2 -mcpu=i486 -fomit-frame-pointer -I../lib -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes \
-Wstrict-prototypes -DNCH=1   -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DSBINDIR=\"/sbin\" \

make[1]: *** [blockdev] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/dma/Sbuilder2/Obj-mourne/util-linux-2.12/disk-utils'
make: *** [all] Error 1


There are actually only 3 errors; the rest are just 
caused by them:

	blockdev.c:70: error: parse error before '[' token
	blockdev.c:73: error: parse error before '[' token
	blockdev.c:331: error: parse error before '[' token

I narrowed things down by doing a macro expansion. blockdev.c
line 70 contains this:

#ifdef BLKSSZGET
        { "--getss", "BLKSSZGET", BLKSSZGET, ARGINTG, -1, NULL, N_("get sectorsize") \
}, #endif

which macro expands to this:
        { "--getbsz", "BLKBSZGET", (((2U) &lt;&lt; (((0 +8)+8)+14)) | (((0x12)) &lt;&lt; (0 +8)) \
| (((112)) &lt;&lt; 0) | (((((sizeof(sizeof(int)) == sizeof(sizeof(int)[1]) &amp;&amp; \
sizeof(sizeof(int)) &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; 14)) ? sizeof(sizeof(int)) : \
__invalid_size_argument_for_IOC))) &lt;&lt; ((0 +8)+8))), 4, -1, ((void *)0), ("get \
blocksize") },   
If you look closely you will see sizeoff(int)[1]. That
is the error which occurs in all three lines here (and
also once in get_blocks.c.

Has anyone else run across this? It looks like a problem
in the _IOR and _IOW macros.

I'm not subscribed to the list, but I'll check back via
the web archive.

This is a multi-part message in MIME format

Dear Sir,

It's my priviledge to briefly introduce myself and the confidential business =
proposal in concern. I write you this letter of request for partnership which =
i hope you give your urgent attention as a
reputable and trustworthy businessman.

I am Mr Godswill Zabina from (Democratic Republic of Congo) a consultant, =
estate and properties valued visiting holland. I was consulted by Dr. Edoman =
Zabina (my Uncle) a personal assistance to the Director General of the Banque =
Du Congo, this is the highest bank in  Congo. The said Dr. Edoman Zabina is a =
uncle and has ask me to help him to look and arrange with a trustworthy =
foreign partner who can assist in keeping the sum of US$18.5M (EIGTHTEEN =
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in his Bank account for =
further investment.

The said amount US$18.5M was transported through Diplomatic Means in Two =
treasure boxes and is presently deposited with a security company here in =
holland since 18th of November 2002 although they do not know the contents =
and he declared the content of the trunk boxes to the security company as =
antiquities and personal effect. This was aimed at protecting the money from =
theft.

Basically, the money was deposited by Uncle Dr. Edoman Zabina before he was =
arrested by the government of my country and when there was probing to =
unravel the circumstances leading to the disapperance of some millions of =
dollars in the country's coffer, my uncle was subsequently arrested along =
with other high ranking officials of the bank.

We would have been able to claim this trunk boxes out on our own but our =
problem is  compounded with the fact that my uncle told the security company =
that the trunk boxes belong to a foreign affiliate who will come forward to =
claim it when due.

However your assistance is seriously needed because as Government official =
they are not allowed to operate any foreign account due to the D.R.C law, =
which does not permit government officials to operate foreign accounts. Dr. =
Edoman  Zabina has decided to compensate you with 25% of the total sum of =
US$18.5M then 5% will be set aside for expences incurred in the course of =
this transaction, while 70% will be for him and his partners.
If you are willing to render him your assistance regarding this transaction =
and safe keeping of the money, all necessary arrangements required for the =
speedy conclusion of this within TEN(10) working days has been concluded.

So i desire all information i have provided you to be kept secret to avoid =
more harm to him, Dr. Edoman Zabina (Personal Assistance to the Director =
General). I am in a position to provide you with further details immediately =
i received acknowledgement of this mail from you as soon as possible as you =
identify positive interest to assist.

For further informations and clarification on this issue please contact me =
through my directline +31-622-535-488 OR my email address.

Awaiting for your urgent responce.

Best regards,

Mr. Godswill Zabina.

1) For encrypted swap, best choice is to put put swap on encrypted
   partition. Type "man swapon" for more details.

2) You recommend use of unseeded (unsalted) passwords. Please consider using
   'losetup -S XXX' and 'mount -o pseed=XXX' options. Seeded passwords offer
   much better resistance against optimized dictionary attacks.

3) You recommend loop-AES-v1.6i version. A small but important bug was fixed
   in loop-AES-v1.7b that affects version v1.6i. If you insist on using
   version v1.6i, please apply this patch after applying

Util-linux patch in loop-AES-v2.0b tarball fails to compile if C library is
compiled against 2.6 kernel headers. This patch should fix that problem.

1) unpack util-linux-2.12 tarball
2) patch util-linux with patch in loop-AES-v2.0b tarball
3) patch util-linux with this patch
4) configure and compile util-linux as usual

Same patch is also here:

Hello,

	I am setting up SuperFreeSwan and one of the options is to use cryptoaip. 

I have tried to find some info on why I would use this. From the web site is says I \
don't have to reboot and can build things as modules. 

So does this mean that the algorithms such as AES and BlowFish can be changed and \
update with rebooting or rebuilding ?

What about adding in new algorithms ?

And where is the install or readme file ? How do I install it ?

It's a known breakage caused by the splitting of libc6-dev and 
linux-kernel-headers, see bugs #220991 and #222878

The Word of the Day for December 8 is:

adventitious • \ad-ven-TIH-shuhs\ Audio icon • adjective
	*1 : coming from another source and not inherent or innate 2 : arising or
occurring sporadically or in other than the usual location

Example sentence:

"Unlike most historic houses in the city, it's all of a piece, with no
adventitious intrusions and no supplemental period pieces." (Hudson Bridges,
Gourmet, December 1989)

Did you know?

"Adventitious" is an adventitious word: it comes to English from the Latin
"adventicius," meaning "coming from outside." This, in turn, comes from
"adventus," the past participle of the verb "advenire," meaning "to arrive"
or "to happen." That verb is also a source of several other English words,
including "advent" (which, in its uncapitalized form, can refer to any
coming or arrival), "adventure" (a word whose earliest sense was "chance
happening"), and "avenue" (a means of arrival).

hi, under mandrake's distro 9.0 :  2.4.19-16mdksecure , I get occasional
bad reads from disk into buffer. filesystem reiserfs (if that matters),

i've seen the corruption mentioned on this list in connection with XFS
but i use reiserfs and experience it too - with me it shows up (as far as
i've noticed) as corrupt file contents. maybe it corrupts the fs
structures too -- don't know.

/etc/fstab:
/dev/hdd2 /mnt/pepsi reiserfs encrypted,encryption=AES,notail 1 1

it appears that the corruption is always in 17-byte chunks.
Also, the buffer stays same until it is removed and re-read.

please note that in the examples below, disk reading activities were
performed between comparisons (cmp -l), to force invalidation of the
current buffer in hopes that next read would re-read the disk and get the
copy into the buffer correctly. Sometimes it is read into the buffer
correctly, sometimes not, as can be seen from below.

through the whole experiment, the files (pepsi-semifinal-JYp*m)
haven't changed, but cmp -l has reported them differently a few times.

what's wrong ? how can this be fixed ? what do i do ?

thanks - rkelly

Looks like something trashes bit 5 of RAM page at address 0x?????FD9. Such
one bit errors of encrypted data always cause one 16 byte block to decrypt
to garbage, plus one bit error in the next 16 byte block because of cipher
block chaining. All of the "cmp -l ..." dumps show exactly same pattern.

May I suggest that you run memtest86 for 24 hours on that box. Last time I
looked (it has been a while), memtest86 was available at:

Looking over Jari's patch, it seems that

Dear friend,
I am Mr. Tony Smith, an official with one of the APEX banks in South Africa. My
colleagues and I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.

On the 6th of June 1998 an American gold miner ran an account with us and his
present balance is valued at US$18,500,000.00 ( Eighteen Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent
a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out from his account
file that he never made a will and all attempt to trace his next of kin was
fruitless, as he had none.

We therefore made further investigations and discovered that he did not declare
any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files.
This sum of $18,500,000.00 is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and
interest is being rolled over at the end of every year.

As it is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this money. According to
the S/African law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to
the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of
kin. This is simple; all we need is some of your details so that the Attorney
will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place
as next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for
the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents
and letters of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money
would be shared in the ration that we both shall agree upon.

There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by
the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of
this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for us. I shall still require your assistance to invest
my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our
share.  

Awaiting your urgent response.

Mr.Tony Smith.

Hello


I cannot seem to get crypto loopback to run.


This is 2.4.22 + patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 from kernel.org on an Debian Woody \
usntable


# losetup -e blowfish /dev/loop0 /tmp/cryptfile
Password :
The cipher does not exist, or a cipher module needs to be loaded into the kernel
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument


i also tried it with util-linux-2.12pre with this result:

usr/src/util-linux-2.12pre/mount# ./losetup -e blowfish /dev/loop0 /tmp/cryptfile
Unsupported encryption type blowfish


i already tired the modular way and also tried to use cryptoapi and loopcrypt static \
complied in the kernel, but always the same result

in the modular way the modules listed below are loaded.


# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
twofish                36112   0  (autoclean)
blowfish                6832   0
cryptoloop              1404   0  (unused)
loop                   11860   0  (autoclean) [cryptoloop]


Why doesn't it work?


Thanks,
Alex

Uhm. Woody is "stable", and has been for a very long time.

Woody is "stable"
Sarge is "testing", and will become "stable" when it's released.
Sid is "unstable". Sid will always be the "unstable" branch.

I just thought I'd point that out since nobody else did.

&gt; I've a big problem with cryptoapi.
&gt; After upgrading to kernel 2.6.0-test4 for several testings I get the
&gt; following message:
&gt; "Error: Password can contain characters only from the set:
&gt; a-zA-Z0-9./". This happens by mounting my AES-cryptofile.
&gt; I've used blanks in my passphrase since last December. How can I get

&gt; Which version of cryptoapi and/or util-linux will work again?
&gt; Now I'm using cryptoapi 0.1.0 and util-linux 2.11r patched for
&gt; cryptoapi.

You seem to be using mount (and losetup) from loop-AES package. This
"character only from set a-zA-Z0-9./" is for compatibility with ancient
loop-AES-v1.0c versions. No one should be using that anymore.

To mount old vulnerable kerneli.org formatted partitions, use mount command
like this:

 mount -t ext2 /dev/hda9 /mnt9 -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,phash=rmd160
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note that kerneli.org implementations do not use seeded+iterated passwords
and are vulnerable to optimized dictionary attacks. If you want your data to
be secure, you should re-encrypt it with seeded+iterated password setup.

From: Barrister Bako Davis Esq.
      B. Davis &amp; Co
      Attorneys/Legal Pratitioner.
      Nigeria.

Dear Friend,

Compliments of the season.Grace and peace and love
from this part of the Atlantic to you.I hope my
letter does not cause you too much embarrassment as i
write to you in good faith based on the contact
address given to me by a friend who works at the
Nigerian embassy in your country.Please excuse my
intrusion into your private life.

I am Barrister Bako Davis, i represent Mohammed
Abacha, son of the late gen. Sani Abacha, who was the
former military head of state in Nigeria, he died in
1998. Since his death, the family has been losing a
lot of money due to vindictive government officials
who are bent on dealing with the family, based on this
therefore, the family has asked me to seek for a
foreign partner who can work with us as to move out
the total sum of US$75,000,000.00 ( seventy five
million united states dollars ), presently in their
possession. this money was of course, acquired by the
late president and is now kept secretly by the family.
The Swiss government has already frozen all the
accounts of the family in Switzerland, and some other
countries would soon follow to do the same. This bid
by some government officials to deal with this family
has made it necessary that we seek your assistance in
receiving this money and in investing it on behalf
of the family.

This must be a joint venture transaction and we must
all work together. since this money is still cash,
extra security measures have been taken to protect it
from theft or seizure, pending when agreement is
reached on when and how to move it into any of your
nominated bank accounts. I have personally worked out
all modalities for the peaceful conclusion of this
transaction. the transaction definitely would be
handled in phases and the first phase will involve the
moving of US$25,000,000.00( twenty five million
united states dollars ).

My clients are willing to give you a reasonable
percentage of this money as soon as the transaction is
concluded. I will, however, based on the grounds that
you are willing to work with us and also all
contentious issues discussed before the commencement
of this transaction. you may also discuss your
percentage before we start to work.As soon as i hear
from you, i will give you all necessary details as to
how we intend to carry out the whole transaction.
Please, do not entertain any fears, as all necessary
modalities are in place, and i assure you of all
success and safety in this transaction.

Please, this transaction requires absolute
confidentiality and you would be expected to treat it
as such until the funds are moved out of this country.
please, you will also ignore this letter and respect
our trust in you by not exposing this transaction,
even if you are not interested.I look forward to
working with you.

Truly yours,

Barrister Bako Davis "Esq"

N,B,

Hello,

I've a big problem with cryptoapi.
After upgrading to kernel 2.6.0-test4 for several testings I get the 
following message: 
"Error: Password can contain characters only from the set: 
a-zA-Z0-9./". This happens by mounting my AES-cryptofile.
I've used blanks in my passphrase since last December. How can I get 
my data back from cryptofile?
Which version of cryptoapi and/or util-linux will work again?
Now I'm using cryptoapi 0.1.0 and util-linux 2.11r patched for 
cryptoapi.

thanks
Marco

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system

</body></email><email><emailId>20030802161205</emailId><senderName>Christophe Saout</senderName><senderEmail>christophe@saout.de</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-08-02 16:12:05-0400</timestampReceived><subject>[RFC] device mapper crypt target</subject><body>

Hi!

I've already sent this mail to lkml, but it doesn't seem to get much
attention. I'd be happy if it would get at least some feedback. I'm
not subscribed to this list, so please cc me or lkml. But I'll look
through the archives regulary in case I miss something.

The last days I've written a target for the device-mapper in the 2.5
kernel that uses the in-kernel cryptoapi to do transparent encryption on
a block device.

It works for me and doesn't show any strange corruptions. Joe (the
device-mapper guy) also looked over it and made some modifications. 


The target doesn't have any special user space tool yet, so you have to
use the dmsetup tool (in the libdevmapper-1.0 package you'll find on the
Sistina ftp server) to set up an encrypted device. It also means that it
doesn't store a passhrase encrypted key, you'll have to directly specify
the key for the symmetric encryption/decrypt operation.

With the dmsetup tool you can create a device like this:

dmsetup create &lt;device name&gt; &lt;table file&gt;

The device will be created in /dev/mapper/&lt;device name&gt; and can be
removed with "dmsetup remove &lt;device name&gt;".

The table file can contain several lines, but if you just want a device
that doesn't use several other devices as backend (like LVM can do),
specifying only one line is fine. The syntax for the crypt target is:

&lt;cipher&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;iv_offset&gt; &lt;dev_path&gt; &lt;start&gt;

&lt;cipher&gt; is one of the ciphers in the cryptoapi like aes or des. You can
optionally specify the block chaining mode like "aes-cbc" or "aes-ecb"
(inspired by cryptoloop, but no copied code). The CBC mode is the
default, but it doesn't really do cipher block chaining, it only
additonally perturbs the encryption by munging the sector number so that
the same sector gets always encrypted differently, like zero-filled
ones.

&lt;key&gt; is the actual key. It's hex encrypted, two digits per byte.

&lt;iv_offset&gt; is used with CBC and you can specify a sector offset for the
perturbation. For example if you want to map only a part of your
encrypted device and start at some offset, you can specify it here, so
that you're still able to read your data.

&lt;dev_path&gt; is the device path of the device you want to encrypt (can
also be a loop device if you want to test things on a file).

&lt;start&gt; is the sector offset in the device where you want the mapping to
start.

So a complete line for the table file might look like:

0 204800 crypt aes 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef 0 /dev/hda7 0

(the second parameter is the size of the device you want to create in
sectors, this would give a 100 MB device).

If something fails look into your log file (and don't forget to remove
the device that was created with dmsetup remove &lt;devname&gt;).


My tests suggest that it's fairly stable. I've created different
filesystems on it (ext2, ext3, reiserfs) and did a lot of copy
operations from/to/on it. A lot of small files, large files.
Unmounting/remounting, etc... I didn't find any corruptions.
It even works when putting swap space on it and it didn't deadlock my
machine under extreme memory pressure.
I also added a lot of temporary debug statements and poisoning code to
make sure that allocations and frees are correctly balanced.


The attached patch adds a dm-daemon.c/.h, this is a forward-ported
version from 2.4 and the actual dm-crypt.c.
It can be compiled in statically or as a module (kernel configuration:
Multiple Devices -&gt; Device mapper -&gt; crypt target).

The patch should apply cleanly on top of 2.6.0-test2. I've appended it
as an attachement because my mailer adds additional newlines. :(

Dear Sir linux-crypto ,

                                Dear Sir,

Listen and read carefully, i have found seriousness in
you and that is why i have decided to involve you in
this transaction o.k , i am  a woman of substance and
of great importance to my nation and the society in
general. i wll not entertain any act of unseriousness
from you in this transaction o.k

you must take instructions from me at all time and for
security reasons you will only communicate me only by
my email for now o.k.

I,am Mrs LOUISA EJERCITOR ESTRADA , the wife of Mr
Joseph Estrada the former president of Philippine
located in the south east Asia. My husband was
presently impeached from office by a backed uprising
of mass demonstrators and the senate.                 
                                        
During my husband's regime as president of
Philippine, I realised US$28.5millions of dollars
from various contract projects I executed
successfully. I had planed to invest this money in 
real estate and industral production.                 
                                                      
Now i have used an NGO to move the money to a bank
in overseas, i want you to assist me transfer the
money to your bank account as the beneficiary because
i do not want the philippine government to trace  and
confiscate this one. they have confiscated all our
asset. This is the only money left for me and my
family o.k
Now if you agree, i will offer you 15% of the total
fund, and you must keep it very secret and
confidential o.k. There is no risk involved, all i
want from you is , your complete name, address, bank
particulars phone and fax numbers, company name if any
and you must be honest o.k
this money will be transfered to your account as soon
as you release this requirements o.k
i look forward to having a good relationship with
you o.k
regards,

Mrs Louise Estrade

This patch allows losetup and mount to do cryptoloop encryption with keys
of size other than 256 bits. For example, to use 128-bit AES-CBC encryption,
the syntax is:

losetup -e aes-cbc-128 /dev/loop/10 /home/sluskyb/testloop
or
mount -o loop,encryption=aes-cbc-128 /home/sluskyb/testloop /mnt/testloop

I figured that since we're now requiring the user to add the -cbc (or -ctr
etc.), -128 would fit in.

This is implemented using POSIX regular expressions. I'm not particularly 
proud of that, but I think if we want to specify key size within the existing
encryption= option then that's the best way to go.

QCF?

This is a multi-part message in MIME format

Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad =
necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing =
the sum of USD21,000.000 (twenty one million  dollars)inherited from my =
father's business reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He =
became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was =
victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was =
assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding =
the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the =
insecurity of both our lives and property then decided to deposit the above =
sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become =
the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt,and the =
farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's loyalists are bent =
on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 25% =
of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or =
30% share for  any joint investment in a reliable venture.

if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed =
information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with =
utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax =
numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

TRAVIS NKALA

CONCERNING IT, THE ACCOUNT HAS NO OTHER BENEFICIARY AND MY 
INVESTIGATION 
PROVED TO ME AS WELL THAT THIS COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
THIS 
ACCOUNT AND THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS USD (26 MILLION DOLLARS). I WANT TO 
TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGNERS ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T 
KNOW ANY FOREIGNER, I AM ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE 
THIS 
MONEY CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO A LOCAL BANK HERE, BUT CAN ONLY BE 
APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGNACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS IN US DOLLARS AND 
THE 
FORMER OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT IS MR. SMITH B. ANDREAS IS A FOREIGNER 
TOO. I 
KNOW THAT THIS MASSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW 
OUR SELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSIN
 ESS.ONLY GOT YOUR CONTACT ADDRESS FROM THE COMPUTER ,WITHBELIEVE IN 
GOD THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN THIS BUSINESS YOU ARE THE ONLY 
PERSON THAT I HAVE CONTACTED IN THIS BUSINESS, SO PLEASE REPLY 
URGENTLY SO 
THAT I WILL INFORM YOU THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE URGENTLY. 

I WANT US TO SEE FACE TO FACE OR SIGN A BINDING AGREEMENT TO BIND US 
TOGETHER SO THAT YOU CAN RECIEVE THIS MONEY INTO A FORIEGN ACCOUNT OR 
ANY 
ACCOUNT OF YOUR CHOICE WHERE THE FUND WILL BE REMMITTED.AND I WILL FLY 
TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR WITHDRAWAL AND SHARING AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. 

I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO INVOLVE A FOREIGNER WITH 
FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND FOREIGN BENEFICIARY. I NEED YOUR CO-OPERATION TO 
MAKE 
THIS WORK FINE. BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT IS READY TO APPROVE THIS 
PAYMENT 
TO ANY FOREIGNER WHO HAS CORRECT INFORMATION OF THIS ACCOUNT, WHICH I 
WILL GIVE TO YOU LATER IMMEDIATELY, IF YOU ARE ABLE AND WITH 
CAPABILITY 
TO HANDLE SUCH AMOUNT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST ACCORDING TO MY

Hi,

Apparently encrypted disks created with 2.4.21 are not readable by 2.6 and
visa-versa. I'm using a patched 2.4.21 kernel with util-linux 2.11n (the
rpms from freshmeat) and a 2.6.0-test2 with util-linux 2.12pre.

Creating and reading an aes encrypted system (dd, losetup, mount) works
fine with both systems, but it is not possible to read an encrypted file
with an other system than the system it was created with. losetup works
fine (it accepts a file of an other system), but mount doesn't work with
"wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock....." is if the password would
be wrong.

Is this in principle not working? Or I'm I doing something wrong?
One thing is strange: losetup from 2.11n has the -k parameter, 2.12 doesnt
have it and also doesn't ask so I don't know what key strength it is
using.

thanks
ueli

New patches here:

The variable key size patch has been touched up a bit but is functionally
identical.

The external program patch has been reworked. The external program
is now specified like this:
	mount -o loop,encryption=aes-cbc-128,keygen=hashprog;sha256 \
		~sluskyb/testloop /mnt/test
The looped file and the encryption method are passed as additional
arguments, so this would run "hashprog sha256 ~sluskyb/testloop
aes-cbc-128" and read the encryption key from its stdout.

There is no equivalent option in losetup, but then
	hashprog sha256 |losetup -e aes-cbc-128 -p 0 /dev/loop/11 \
		~sluskyb/testloop
works just fine.

I've cut out xgetpass() entirely. Now that hashing is done outside
losetup, there's no sense in reading any more than LO_KEY_SIZE bytes.
So if we're given an fd or an external program then we do a plain old
read(2), otherwise a plain old getpass(3).

QCF?

I saw you online and thought you might like to take a look at this

I refinanced my mortgage and this site got me the best financer available

I personally couldnt have got out of the mess I was in without this site

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system

</body></email><email><emailId>20030808180538</emailId><senderName>"mike () flyn ! org"</senderName><senderEmail>mike@flyn.org</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-08-08 18:05:38-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Cryptoswap script</subject><body>

I've been working on Dale Amon's cryptoswap.sh Debian initialization
script.  The script no longer requires devfs.  I would like some feedback
from whoever may be interested.

I have not updated the script's documentation yet, but this fstab
record will give you an AES encrypted swap partition using /dev/hdaX
and /dev/loopY:

/dev/loopY none swap sw,swapfile=/dev/hdaX,encryption®s 0 0

Of course, doing this will destroy any existing data on /dev/hdaX so
be careful.  Perform at your own risk!

If you are using Debian, install the script in /etc/init.d and make the
appropriate links to rcS.d, rc6.d and rc0.d.  Crypto swap partitions
should be created right before checkroot.sh is run and torn down after
sysklogd.

Here is the script:

#!/bin/sh
#============================================================================# \
Cryptoswap space boot script #
# Title:                kernel
# Description:          Setup and teardown crypto swap devices
# Programmed by:        Dale Amon &lt;amon@islandone.org&gt;
# Revised by:           $Author: kyle $
# Date:                 $Date: 2002/07/23 21:42:32 $
# Version:              $Revision: 1.1 $
#
# NOTE:		* THIS IS NOT A RELEASABLE VERSION
#		* Something must be done to fill the entropy pool
#		* compatibility with modular kernel with devfs?
#		* what to do with a bad cipher name?
#		* what to do with non-crypto kernel?
#		* what to do with an as yet unloaded cipher module?

On a related note, what are the odds of getting Jari's code for
preallocated bio's (which makes encrypted swap workable) merged into
Linus' tree? I suppose it's a little late for 2.6.0... But maybe 2.6.x,
for some low value of x?

Wishfully thinking,

Oops, the patch can't handle nulls or newlines or other weird stuff in
the hashed passphrase. To be fixed later.

I have been happily using kerneli.org's crypto patches for quite some time and 
am now begining to look at the new 2.6 code.  I have some questions util-linux 
2.12 and the cryptoloop/crypto drivers in linux 2.6.0-test2.

1.  What is the deal with adding arguments to losetup so that the program will 
support calling external hashing programs (Ben Slusky's work I think)?  I have 
been hashing passwords with openssl, a pipe and losetup's -p 0 option for quite 
some time.  Why is the additional code needed?  Am I missing something here?

2.  Is it safe to use the 2.6 code to encrypt a swap partition (or safe to
start testing this since this is all experimental code)?

3.  Mount needs to support variable key sizes.  I have seen a little discussion  
about this but I fear much of it went on using other mailing lists.  Losetup 
supports variable key sizes so mount should somehow.  Granted, losetup is not 
usually suid root, but the code addition to mount is minimal and mount is 
essentially broken without it.  Comments?

Thanks for all the work to get this stuff into 2.6 and util-linux.  I have been 
waiting for this code to go mainstream for years!

Ok, this time for sure.

To recap, since linux-crypto seems to have dropped the other email due to
its size, this patch allows losetup and mount to use an external program
to hash the password. The program is specified using the -P option to
losetup or mount, like so:

losetup -e aes-cbc-128 -P sha256prog /dev/loop/10 /home/sluskyb/testloop
or
mount -o loop,encryption=aes-cbc-128 -P sha256prog /home/sluskyb/testloop /mnt/testloop

Note that the -P and -p options won't work together. As of this patch
losetup/mount will complain if you specify -p and -P, or two of either
-p or -P.

A quick-and-dirty hashing program, comprised mostly of the relevant bits
of the old kerneli patch, can be found at
&lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/hashalot.tar.bz2&gt;

QCF?

one might really want to be able to specifiy the passphrase acquiring
plugin as fstab-option, in order to allow unattended automatic mounting
of fs volumes -- i.e. think of some executable/script that gathers the
passphrase from some removable media, that has to be inserted into the
system at boot-up time (e.g. smartcard, or even a plain old floppy disk)

one might also want to be able to specify some options to pass to the
passphrase-acquiral executable; that way one doesn't have to install a
dozen of small binaries (or symlinks to the same one, and having to
discriminate on argv[0]), just have slightly different behaviours

so the mount line above might look something like:

mount -o loop,encryption=aes-cbc-128,key_exec=/sbin/get_and_hash_passphrase,key_args=sha256 \
/home/sluskyb/testloop /mnt/testloop

one could prepend some default arguments before the user-defined ones,
such as mountpoint, selected encryption algo/params (in order to allow
for more control about how to fill (or pad remaining) keybits)

any comments?

I think this would be good.

This way it should be possibel to get an autofs-usable version,
currently it is impossibel because there is no way for autofs to get the
password. (autofs isn't able to get the keyboard-focus, or am i wrong?)

With such an option you could write a "Passwort Popup for X11" or
something in this direction. You cause an automount-event and a window
with a password-dialog popups up. (I would like this!)

Quoting Herbert Valerio Riedel &lt;hvr@hvrlab.org&gt;:

&gt; this looks a bit inconsistent, since the encryption algorithm is passed
&gt; as -o option, while the hashing filter is passed completely different;
&gt; one might really want to be able to specifiy the passphrase acquiring
&gt; plugin as fstab-option, in order to allow unattended automatic mounting

&gt; one might also want to be able to specify some options to pass to the

&gt; dozen of small binaries (or symlinks to the same one, and having to
&gt; discriminate on argv[0]), just have slightly different behaviours

Sounds good. My thinking had been that the syntax should be as similar as 
possible to the syntax for specifying fd, since they conflict with each other.
Also Andries has said that he's opposed to more "-o" type options (also 
evidenced by the fact that he turned "-o passfd=" into -p).

&gt; so the mount line above might look something like:
&gt; 
&gt; mount -o
&gt; loop,encryption=aes-cbc-
128,key_exec=/sbin/get_and_hash_passphrase,key_args=sha256
&gt; /home/sluskyb/testloop /mnt/testloop
&gt; 
&gt; one could prepend some default arguments before the user-defined ones,
&gt; such as mountpoint, selected encryption algo/params (in order to allow
&gt; for more control about how to fill (or pad remaining) keybits)
&gt; 
&gt; any comments?

Or if Andries objects, I would propose cutting out the key_args option, instead 
using the default args you described and discriminating on argv[0]...

I don't recall saying that. Anyway, one is forced tohave things -o-style
if the options are to be read from fstab.

&gt; I don't recall saying that. Anyway, one is forced tohave things -o-style
&gt; if the options are to be read from fstab.


If I understand correctly, then it is exactly this use case -- 
specification of options in fstab -- that is the primary motivation for 
Ben Slusky's patches.

Otherwise, an external hash program can be performed with a pipe using 
file-decriptor zero, I do this myself:

# gpg -d password-foo | losetup -p 0 -e encryption-algorithm...


I think that being able to specify options in fstab can offer 
more-simple system configuration (as opposed to scripts such as the 
crypto-swap script). People can still rely upon such scripts, of course, 
if they prefer.

Sorry if I'm stating the obvious here...

&gt; 1.  What is the deal with adding arguments to losetup so that the program will 
&gt; support calling external hashing programs (Ben Slusky's work I think)?  I have 
&gt; been hashing passwords with openssl, a pipe and losetup's -p 0 option for quite 
&gt; some time.  Why is the additional code needed?  Am I missing something here?

I think it is so you can specify options to the mount(8) program in 
/etc/fstab; this might give people the option of a rather powerful 
system setup with management from only one file (/etc/fstab) -- you can 
imagine not having to use a crypto-swap wrapper script, for example.


&gt; 2.  Is it safe to use the 2.6 code to encrypt a swap partition (or safe to
&gt; start testing this since this is all experimental code)?

I certainly think so.

&gt; 3.  Mount needs to support variable key sizes.  I have seen a little discussion  
&gt; about this but I fear much of it went on using other mailing lists.  Losetup 
&gt; supports variable key sizes so mount should somehow.  Granted, losetup is not 
&gt; usually suid root, but the code addition to mount is minimal and mount is 
&gt; essentially broken without it.  Comments?

Loop-AES patches to losetup certainly support this, so it must be useful 
to people. Investigate at loop-aes.sourceforge.net

Thanks for your comments!

oh, i tried this once before, because i've seen this somewhere too. but 
it does not work here. mount seems to recognize the "encryption" option, 
but it asks about the keysize:

EXT2-fs: Unrecognized mount option keybits

but even why i type in the keysize and the (now empty) password, 
mounting fails.

so i'll stick to my little script which will prompt me upon booting 
about the passphrase.


Thank you,
Christian.

Dear Sir/Madam,
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me =
personally. I am the first Son of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe =
who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact =
through network online hence decided to write you. Before the death of my =
father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$30 Million =
(thirty million United States dollars), in one of the private security =
company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was =
deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security =
Company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the =
Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came =
when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new Land Act =
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, =
and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans =
and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because =
of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is =
against this background that I and my family fled Zimbabwe to South Africa =
for fear of our lives.

After which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the =
Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to =
transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law =
of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to =
be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of =
European Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with the =
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be =
transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking =
everything we have got. 
The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced =
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for =
fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar =
political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future =
and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction =
is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do =
for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the =
Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i =
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the =
Netherlands from South Africa.

But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of =
ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can =
choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account =
for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper =
profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you =
want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all =
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. 

If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money =
while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of =
your choice. Contact with my email- ( zumajames22@netscape.net ) while I =
implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. 
I await your immediate reply and God bless. 
Best regards,

MR. ZUMA  JAMES.

NOTE: 
ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I =
CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

Hi,
as you've probably noticed that the 2.4.22-pre3 kernel includes some
crypto support the problem is however that there's no cryptoloop support. crypto-api, patch-int breaks
and i haven't seen anything on either LKML or BK-Commits about any loop support.

is there a stand alone cryptoloop patch that i have missed?
will cryptoloop be supported in the near future (=2.4.23) or do i have to
stick with 2.4.21 or change to 2.5 when looking for a new kernel?

cheers
Thomas

Mr: Johnson Ncube
Tel:+31-627 310 845
CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me
personally.The purpose of my introduction is that I am Johnson Ncube the
first son of Nkono Ncube a farmer in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land
dispute in my country.I got your contact through network online hence
decided to write you.Before the death of my father,he had taken me to
Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million,Five Hundred
Thousand United States dollars),in one of the private security company, as
he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box
as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company.This amount was
meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and
establishment of new farms in Swaziland.
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe introduced
a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few
black farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean
war veterans and some lunatics in the society.In fact a lot of people were
killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the
victims. It is against this background that,I and my family fled Zimbabwe
for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we
are seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father's
money to a more reliable foreign account.since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be
involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands. As the eldest son of my father,I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could
be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking
everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing
along with them.
I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South
Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future,both
countries have similar political history.As a businessman,I am seeking for a
partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands,I
must let you know that this transaction is risk free.If you accept to assist
me and my family all I want you to do for me,is to make an arrangements with
the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their afiliate
office here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for the
consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.But before
then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to
the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for
investment.
I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or
you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of
the money in your country.Whichever the option you want,feel free to notify
me.I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses
incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a
partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining
85% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with the above
e-mail address while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required
in this transaction.
Thanks,God bless you
Yours Faithfully
Johnson Ncube.

  DEAR PARTNER,

I GOT YOUR ADDRESS FROM A BUSINES CONSULTANT ON MY
REQUEST FOR A FOREIGN BUSINESSMAN OR FIRM.

I DID NOT DISCLOSE THE EXACT KIND OF BUSINESS I HAVE
IN MIND TO THE CONSULTANT.

I AM A FORMER AIDE TO THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE
RICHEST NATION IN AFRICA (NIGERIA).

I WAS MANDATED BY MRS MARIAM ABACHA WIFE OF THE FORMER
PRESIDENT TO SEEK FOR A RELIABLE FOREIGNER WHO WILL
ASSIST US TO INVEST SOME HUGE AMOUNT OF USD.

THE ABACHA FAMILY ARE UNDER SERIOUS MONITORING BY THE
PRESENT GOVERNMENT DUE TO HEAVY AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY
LOOTED. ALL THEIR ACCOUNTS HAS BEEN FROZEN AND
CONFISCATED.

I WAS VERY POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL DURING ABACHAS
REGIME BUT I DO NOT HAVE FOREIGN CONTACTS HENCE MY
REASON FOR MAKING THIS KIND OF CONTACT WITHOUT EVEN
HAVING MET YOU BEFORE.

I WOULD WANT AN ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT YOU WILL BE
VERY HONEST AND ALSO KEEP THIS BUSINESS CONCEALED FROM
OTHER EARS. HOWEVER THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS ABSOLUTE
CONFIDENTIALITY IN ALL PLACES AT ALL TIME.

THE MONEY IN QUESTION WAS KEPT WITH A SECURITY COMPANY
BY ABACHA WHEN HE WAS ALIVE, THE MONEY WAS MEANT TO
BE USED TO LOBBY PRESIDENT OF OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS
SO THAT HE WILL GET ALL THE SUPPORTS HE NEEDS TO
PERPETUATE HIMSELF IN POWER.

THE SECURITY COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF THE CONTENT
BECAUSE ABACHA USED HIS INFLUENCE TO KEEP THE
CONSIGNMENT CONTAINING THE MONEY AS PRECIOUS STONES
WHEREAS THE REAL CONTENT IS AMERICAN U.S DOLLARS.

I HAVE ALREADY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A BRITISH
DIPLOMAT WHO HAS AGREED TO HELP ME FREIGHT THE
CONSIGNMENT OUT OF MY COUNTRY, I TOLD HIM TOO, THAT
THE CONSIGNMENT CONTAINS PRECIOUS STONES. HIS
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE IN MOVING OUT
THE MONEY.

WE WILL MEET AT AN AGREED COUNTRY WHERE YOU WILL CLAIM
OWNERSHIP OF THE CONSIGNMENT CONTAINING THE MONEY. I
AM STILL LOOKING FOR A COUNTRY WHERE WILL BE VERY
CONDUCIVE FOR US ALL.

I WILL TELL YOU THE AMOUNT INVOLVED WHEN I HEAR FROM
YOU AND ALSO YOUR PERCENTAGE.

I WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION WHEN I RECEIVE YOUR
1)Confidential Phone/Fax Numbers

2)Full Name and Address.
REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT I WONT CONTACT ANY
OTHER PERSON.

BYE AND GOD BLESS.

CHIEF.IJABU NWECHELIBE

Hi,
I am using kernel 2.4.21 with the corresponding
crypto-patches (patch-int-2.4.21.0.bz2) and loop-patch
(loop-jari-2.4.21.0.patch). When writing a large
amount of data to an encrypted folder residing in a
single file, the complete system crashes.

I am doing the following:

# dd if=/dev/urandom of=~/.crypto bs=1024 count=2048
# losetup -e aes -k 256 /dev/loop0 ~/.crypto
# mke2fs /dev/loop0
# mount /dev/loop0 ~/crypto
# cp -a ~/unencrypted_folder ~/crypto

After a few minutes of copying data there is no more
harddisk activity but the last cp command does not
complete. Any services on the machine (sshd, httpd,
ftpd) are no longer reachable. It is possible to type
the user name after the login prompt at the local
console, but pressing enter then does not give the
prompt for the password. The kernel is still routing
ip packets though.

I eventually have to press the reset button.

Any clues?

From : Josef Konan Bedie

Tel-+34620093064

Attn:director

   
                 URGENT ASSISTANT
                   ----------
I got your contact through the World Trade
Organisation (W.T.O). I decided to contact you on a
mutual business relationship. My name is Mr. Josef
Konan Bedie the son of former president Henri Konan
Bedie of cote d´Ivoire, who was unfortunately toppled
in a military coup in Dec. 1999 by General Robert
Guei.As at when the military junta struck, and
overthrew the elected government of my father, he was
forced to go into exile in France while some of his
ministers and close aids ran to other countries.

When my father was in power, I was co-ordinating his
special businesses, and was also in charge of all his
deposit account with different financial instituions
in Europe.

To this Switzerland and Luxembourg Government have
already responded by exposing many of my family´s bank
account in their country. It is based on this
development that i have the mandate of my father to
contact you and reques you specifically to assist my
family, by helping us to secure this deposit we have
with a financial institution in Europe, which amounts 
to( US$35M),Thirty Five million US dollars. This will
make it impossible for the new Government in power in
my country, to have access to this fund.

It is base on the fact that I am requesting you to
assist us in putting this sum of money in safe keeping
by accepting to receive it from the financial
institution on our behalf by changing the name and
signatory of the account into yours so that it will
not have any link to my family and for that reason, my
country will not find it.

I will furnish you the details of this transaction if
you accept to assist. For your efforts we will discuss
what remuneration i will give you when you reply.


Because of the urgency this issue requires. you
should reach me on the above e-mail addresses or call me because right now am \
currently in spain,were the consigment is.

Do not forget to include your telephone and fax numbers indicating your mailing \
address while replying to this message.

I wait for your quick response.

Best regards.

Josef Konan Bedie.

Hi,

I have been digging the mailinglist archives a bit
further. I know this is way old stuff, but the symtoms
described there are just those I experience since
upgrading to 2.4.21 kernel:

http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2001-02/msg00001.html
&gt; I can confirm this.  The system totally locks when
this occurs.  I let
&gt; it sit all night when it did this the last time, and
it didn't
&gt; recover.

In the article, it's referred to as: "loopback hang"
bug.

Any help very much appreciated.

Put your data on device backed (partition backed) loop.

File backed loops may deadlock. This may happen when kernel is running out
of free RAM, and when a process is running file system code and is holding
some exclusive resource, and calls VM to allocate more RAM saying "allocate
me some RAM, but don't re-enter any file system code while doing that". At
that point VM will shovel out some dirty RAM pages to satisfy allocation
request. Dirty pages that are sent to normal devices, or device backed
loops, don't have problems with that. Guess what happens when such shoveled
out RAM pages are on file backed loop: before RAM can be freed, they need to
be written to file system, and they may need to acquire that same exclusive
resource that other thread happens to be holding. IOW, one thread waits for
RAM to be freed, other thread waits for exlusive resource other thread is
holding. Deadlock.

File backed loops work OK when they are used in read-only mode.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

I tried that and it works fine now. Thanks for the
thorough explaination.

&gt; File backed loops may deadlock. [...]
Maybe that would be worth mentioning in the howtos and
the readme files.

&gt; File backed loops work OK when they are used in
&gt; read-only mode.
Only problem with that is, you never get any data in
them that way. ;)

&gt; Maybe that would be worth mentioning in the howtos and
&gt; the readme files.

Not all filesystems deadlock. It depends on implementation. A small change
can turn working file system into deadlocking one, and vice versa.

loop-AES' README file has this lame comment: "If you can choose between
device backed and file backed, choose device backed even if it means that
you have to re-partition your disks."

&gt; &gt; File backed loops work OK when they are used in
&gt; &gt; read-only mode.
&gt; Only problem with that is, you never get any data in
&gt; them that way. ;)

From : Josef Konan Bedie

Tel-+34620093064

DEAR FRIEND.

   
                 URGENT ASSISTANT
                   ----------
I got your contact through the World Trade
Organisation (W.T.O). I decided to contact you on a
mutual business relationship. My name is Mr. Josef
Konan Bedie the son of former president Henri Konan
Bedie of cote d´Ivoire, who was unfortunately toppled
in a military coup in Dec. 1999 by General Robert
Guei.As at when the military junta struck, and
overthrew the elected government of my father, he was
forced to go into exile in France while some of his
ministers and close aids ran to other countries.

When my father was in power, I was co-ordinating his
special businesses, and was also in charge of all his
deposit account with different financial instituions
in Europe.

To this Switzerland and Luxembourg Government have
already responded by exposing many of my family´s bank
account in their country. It is based on this
development that i have the mandate of my father to
contact you and reques you specifically to assist my
family, by helping us to secure this deposit we have
with a financial institution in Europe, which amounts 
to( US$35M),Thirty Five million US dollars. This will
make it impossible for the new Government in power in
my country, to have access to this fund.

It is base on the fact that I am requesting you to
assist us in putting this sum of money in safe keeping
by accepting to receive it from the financial
institution on our behalf by changing the name and
signatory of the account into yours so that it will
not have any link to my family and for that reason, my
country will not find it.

I will furnish you the details of this transaction if
you accept to assist. For your efforts we will discuss
what remuneration i will give you when you reply.

Because of the urgency this issue requires. you
should reach me on the above e-mail addresses or call me because right now am \
currently in spain,were the consigment is.

Do not forget to include your telephone and fax numbers indicating your mailing \
address while replying to this message.

I wait for your quick response.

Best regards.

Josef Konan Bedie.

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system
Archive:       http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/


</body></email><email><emailId>20030713190002</emailId><senderName>Nomen Nescio</senderName><senderEmail>nobody@dizum.com</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-07-13 19:00:02-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Using losetup and crypto-API to encrypt individual files</subject><body>

I trying to use crypto-API to encrypt individual file
(against `gpg -c` or mcrypt). Result is strange:

1). Decrypted file every time is not completed
(end 128-bit block of file is lost).

2). Decrypted file every time is one.
(one md5sum). May be IV in CBC is one
or encrypting is ECB?

I need to have CBC with random IV encryption
for individual files (stdin) using bash (perl) 
and crypto-API.

Please help me.

I want to use CryptoAPI with RH9 (kernel 2.4.20-8). It seems that all
"basic" modules are included in the RH9 distribution (e.g. a 'modprobe cryptoloop'
loads all three modules as described in the 'pdf' tutorial on the web site.
But, unfortunately more or less all cipher modules are missed.

The cryptoapi-0.1.0.tar.gz sources won't compile.

Anybody here who got the stuff runnung on RH9?

Ciao, Meph
 
PS: In case that it helps, the first lines of the error messages when trying
to build the modules from source:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe someone can help me.
&gt; I would like to have an encrypted home directory for each user. I have created
&gt; an encrypted partition for each user and would like to have it mounted
&gt; automatically when a user logs in.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be perfect, if the home dir would be mounted with the same password
&gt; like the user uses to log in, but for the beginning it would be good to have
&gt; the user to login with password and again type in the password when his
&gt; homedirectory gets mounted (encrypted file system).

pam_mount (http://www.flyn.org/projects/pam_mount/index.html) does exactly

Hello,

            REQUEST FOR YOUR HELP

My name is Mrs. Benedicta Batah, widow of late Dr. M. Batah, a former Financial \
Controller in the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology.


My late husband died on 10th January 2002 in a motor accident along Minna-Abuja Road \
while on official duty.


I have just been informed by our family attorney, that my late husband operated a \
secret and coded  account with a Bank into which some amount of money was transferred \
and credited in his favour. 


The Attorney now advised me to seek in confidence a foreigner who could stand  as \
owner of the fund to enable us wire it into his account from the local bank. 


If you can help, get back to me immediately so that I can tell you how we can \
proceed. Everything is risk free.


Yours truly,


Mrs. Benedicta Batah

Good Day,
with warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I=

am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I
propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.
My name is JOHN JNR, the son of ZHIRI , a farmer
from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by
my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for =
contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact
anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I
apologize if this is not acceptable to you.
The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in
Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new
Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few
rich black farmers, all white farmers were asked to
surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his =
political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the =
farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not =
support the president's idea. 
He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade =
my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They killed my
father and took away a lot of items from his farm. 
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my =
father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we =
should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will documents has a =
certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit totaling Fifteen million =
five hundred thousand united state dollars. [15.5m] Kept in custody for us in =
a security company unknown
to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal =
belongings. This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for =
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new =
machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.
This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
my beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.
I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
after he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
with the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
with his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but =
all to no avail.
I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in Johannesburg =
here, which they have since done.
I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the
money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum
seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial
transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable
partner, whose account this money can be transferred, hence this proposal to =
you.
You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
and brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.
If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
with arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
from Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.
For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an =
account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
your reply.
I have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.
Please, I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
this transaction.
Your reply should be sent to my private email address only 
johnzhirijn@netscape.net
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.
Sincerely,
johnzhirijn@netscape.net

&gt; &gt; Your loop-AES loop.o module seems to not load automatically. This can be
&gt; &gt; result of having loop built-in on your kernel or that module autoloading
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; disabled. If above settings are not like that, you have to reconfigure
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; recompile new kernel, and boot that new kernel. 

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP set on y. I Thought i had changed it. But obviously i
hadn't.

&gt; 
&gt; Correction: Your running kernel was built on Wed Mar 27 13:57:05 UTC 2002.
&gt; You are running wrong kernel, not the one loop.o module was compiled for.

And i didn't do make install. Well, it was the first time for me to compile
the kernel. Thus i didn't quite know all the steps. Anyway, this helped me a
lot to understand how it all works. Anyway, maybe it also helped you to
understand the problems linux-newbies meet, when they encounter loop-aes.
None the less, it works now, and i'm happy. Thanx!

I am the Director-General, Federal Ministry of Works &amp; Housing.  In my capacity as \
the Chairman of the Ministry’s Tenders Board, this contact is being made on behalf of \
my colleagues for a mutually beneficial and risk-free business relationship. 

The Tenders Board is about awarding a contract worth Millions of United States.  We \
want to influence the award to a company/person that can inflate the contract value \
so that the over inflated sum will be for us. 

It does not matter the kind of business you are doing. We will ensure with our \
contact and connections in the Ministry that the contract is awarded to you and \
payment processed immediately. 

Please let me know if you are interested in the business.

Full details of this business will be sent to you upon receipt of your reply.

Yours faithfully,

</body></email><email><emailId>20030505135802</emailId><senderName></senderName><senderEmail>alexalie</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-05-05 13:58:02-0400</timestampReceived><subject>=?iso-8859-2?Q?From=20Mr=20Alex=20Kargbo=20Alie=20?=</subject><body>

From Mr Alex Kargbo Alie 

Dear Sir 

I am Mr. Alex Kargbo Alie and my sister is Miss Jan Kargbo Alie we are the children \
of late Chief Kargbo Alie from Sierra Leone. 

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer \
our cash of thirty Million Dollars ($30,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private \
Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as \
family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the \
content as money, although my  father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs \
to his foreign partner. 

Source of the money: 

My late father Chief Kargbo Alie, a native of Moyamba District in the Northerh \
province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation \
(S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from \
Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war \
between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG \
peace keeping operation that almost  destroyed my country, following the forceful \
removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the \
rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my \
mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with \
the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid of \
U.N evacuation team. 

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and \
Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of \
the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government \
functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his \
relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's 
involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely \
deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she \
later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this \
year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country \
suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees \
and orphans. 

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firmm,To this \
effect,I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. 

1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security Firm as our beneficiary 

2. to transfer this money (USD$30M) in your name to your country 

3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our behalf in your \
country and you, our Adviser/ Manager For your assistance, I have agreed with my \
younger sister that 20% of the total amount will be for your effort and another 10 % \
to cover all the expenses that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I \
urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one  knows our where \
about. 

Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name, address and Tel/ \
Fax numbers, tome via my private email address as indicated bellow, this is for \
security reasons as i will only be accessing my private email earnestly awaiting your \
response. 

( alexkargbo@latinmail.com ) 

Thanks. 

May God bless you as you assist us. 

Mr. Alex Kargbo Alie

From Mr Alex Kargbo Alie 

Dear Sir 

I am Mr. Alex Kargbo Alie and my sister is Miss Jan Kargbo Alie we are the children \
of late Chief Kargbo Alie from Sierra Leone. 

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer \
our cash of thirty Million Dollars ($30,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private \
Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as \
family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the \
content as money, although my  father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs \
to his foreign partner. 

Source of the money: 

My late father Chief Kargbo Alie, a native of Moyamba District in the Northerh \
province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation \
(S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from \
Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war \
between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG \
peace keeping operation that almost  destroyed my country, following the forceful \
removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the \
rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my \
mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with \
the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid of \
U.N evacuation team. 

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and \
Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of \
the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government \
functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his \
relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's 
involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely \
deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she \
later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this \
year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country \
suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees \
and orphans. 

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firmm,To this \
effect,I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. 

1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security Firm as our beneficiary 

2. to transfer this money (USD$30M) in your name to your country 

3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our behalf in your \
country and you, our Adviser/ Manager For your assistance, I have agreed with my \
younger sister that 20% of the total amount will be for your effort and another 10 % \
to cover all the expenses that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I \
urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one  knows our where \
about. 

Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name, address and Tel/ \
Fax numbers, tome via my private email address as indicated bellow, this is for \
security reasons as i will only be accessing my private email earnestly awaiting your \
response. 

( alexkargbo@latinmail.com ) 

Thanks. 

May God bless you as you assist us. 

Mr. Alex Kargbo Alie

Members of linux-crypto,

Is it in any way possible to block the spam messages sent from user
'xm-editor' to the linux-crypto mailing-list? For past one-and-a-half week,
i've been receiving more invitations to join gang-bangs from this particular
user then i have received crypto-related messages from the entire
mailing-list memberbase. I was wondering if there is any way to ban this
'xm-editor' user from further messing up serious people's 'inboxes', since
all this user seem to do is spread spam? Is there any 'spam' policy for this
mailinglist?

with regards,

Menno Knol.

Good Day, 



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, 
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will 
be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me 
since you do not know me personally. 
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this 
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a 
person of integrity. 

My name is  Galadima  the first son of  Musa, 
of the most popular black farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered 
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, 
I decided to contact you through email, after searching 
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means 
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with 
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The 
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed 
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and 
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President 
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly 
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black 
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my 
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. 



Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business 
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in 
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit 
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred 
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This 
money was deposited with this Private Security company for 
safety and security reasons, and  was to be used for the 
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment 
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the 
violent  Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the 
society, led to the murder of my beloved father and other 
innocent lives. 

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from 
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but 
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder 
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the 
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my 
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security 
company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they 
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here. 

I need to transfer this money to  an account and invest part 
of the money. Since the law of  Spain  prohibits a refugee 
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved 
in any financial transaction, this is why  I am seeking a 
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can 
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to 
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future 
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. 

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is 
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the 
security company from their office here in The Spain, 
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa 
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of 
you representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you. 

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your 
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money 
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with 
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your 
country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in 
your reply. I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money 
for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of 
this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. 

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, 
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want you 
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction. 
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in 
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my 
direct line which is 34-680-135-596 or via email
galadima_musa@rediffmail.com

Sincerely, 

Galadima  Musa .

Hello,

Do you know if it exists a software allowing to decrypt a loop-aes 
encrypted container in Windoze XP ? (a kind of loop-aes Windoze port :-/

The idea is to exchange data between the two OS.

I only have this problem on my company email-account. The problem here is
that I don't have access to my company's mailserver configuration files,
since I work for this company as a programmer, not as a systems-admin. 

I could add a blocking-rule in my Outlook-client, but that still causes
'unproffesional' mail (and images) to traverse our company network. The only
way i can definitely prefend this is by desubscribing to the linux-crypto
mailinglist with my company email-account, but I was hoping that the
mailinglist server had some sort of spam-policy that prevented users like
'xm-editor' from spreading their spam by starting at the very base: block
messages from this user to the maillinglist.

I was wondering if this is at all possible for this maillinglist, and if so,
if there is a (global?) maillinglist policy that encompasses this particular
spam-incident.

So, at my personal/private account, i have no 'real' problem, since my
home-mailserver already blocks all messages from 'xm-editor'. It's more that
i don't like my companies mail-admin coming to me and asking me what these
'nice' images are that i keep getting and that keep 'wasting' company
bandwidth. It's kind of embarrasing, eventhough he (the mail-admin) knows
that it's spam.

regards,

Menno Knol.

Good Day, 



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, 
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will 
be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me 
since you do not know me personally. 
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this 
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a 
person of integrity. 

My name is  Galadima  the first son of  Musa, 
of the most popular black farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered 
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, 
I decided to contact you through email, after searching 
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means 
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with 
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The 
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed 
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and 
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President 
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly 
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black 
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my 
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. 



Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business 
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in 
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit 
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred 
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This 
money was deposited with this Private Security company for 
safety and security reasons, and  was to be used for the 
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment 
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the 
violent  Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the 
society, led to the murder of my beloved father and other 
innocent lives. 

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from 
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but 
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder 
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the 
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my 
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security 
company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they 
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here. 

I need to transfer this money to  an account and invest part 
of the money. Since the law of  Spain  prohibits a refugee 
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved 
in any financial transaction, this is why  I am seeking a 
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can 
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to 
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future 
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. 

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is 
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the 
security company from their office here in The Spain, 
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa 
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of 
you representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you. 

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your 
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money 
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with 
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your 
country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in 
your reply. I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money 
for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of 
this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. 

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, 
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want you 
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction. 
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in 
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my 
direct line which is 34-680-135-596 or via email
galadima_musa@rediffmail.com

Sincerely, 

Galadima  Musa .

Hi, does placing a seed into the initrg.gz file mean that the only
way to read off this drive, is to boot off it?  I ask because i'd
like to make it necessary to boot the hard drive and possibly allow
for the inclusion of  "safty traps".  There's nothing that can be
done if the disk is simply mounted in another PC readonly.

The bootup password prompt could accept a few different passwords.
If forced, the user gives up a "safety trap" password.  This password
appears to de-crypt fine so the user is off the hook, however this
password has been setup to run a different bootup script.  Possible
implementations could allow mounting a crafted fake root, or perhaps
simply running a "rm -rf" script.  I think something like this would
greatly improve the security of an encrypted hard drive solution.

Secondly,  I'm not sure if the seed is easily recoverable from the
initrd.gz, i imagine its probably plain (binary) text?  Perhaps we
could take the same approach as an ssh connection where an initial
encrypted session is engaged before the real encrypted session is
initiated.

At the moment i have an RC script that echo's my password to losetup,
as long as my system is on its susceptible to unrelated rooting
exploits that could expose my precious encryption password ( or
private key )

Brad.

Hi, I'm a crypto implementer and want to run a crypto file system
under Linux.  I'm looking at loop_aes and I like its simple design and
installation.  I have a few comments about the cryptography.

- The docs in several places advice generating the AES key from a
  password and a "salt".  I think the docs should advise using a
  passphrase generated by selecting words at random from a dictionary,
  rather than a password.  &lt;http://www.diceware.com&gt; gives a good way to
  do this.  I've implemented the diceware algorithm on a web page:

    http://www.nightsong.com/crypto/dice.php

  the phrase generator is written in client side Javascript, so the
  server never sees your phrase or the seed entropy that you supply.

- The method of generating AES CBC initialization vectors for file system
  blocks has some minor weaknesses:
    - the IV for a disk sector is simply the sector number, so if
      an attacker can copy your hard drive without your knowledge,
      then you change something (e.g. update a database field) and
      the attacker reads the disk again, he can tell the exact
      location (in AES blocks) of the first change in the sector.
      Colin Plumb has a clever method (used in Peter Gutmann's SFS)
      for computing an IV based on the whole contents of the sector:

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=7gicpf%24k21%241%40scream.auckland.ac.nz

   - Since the IV is just an increasing integer sequence, it's not
     completely implausible that some file has sectors whose first
     AES blocks, when xor'd with their sector numbers, give the same
     IV.  Suppose file A begins on sector 536 and its first four
     32-bit words are 0 0 0 1.  File B begins on sector 537 and its
     first four words are all zero.  This means both files get the
     same IV and if their next several blocks are equal, the attacker
     can tell that.  Colin's scheme helps that; encrypting the IV
     (with a different key than the FS key) before using it would help too.

   - If you have two file systems encrypted with the same key, they
     get the same set of IV's and the attacker can find all the
     sectors that are pairwise equal (or have common prefixes) between
     the two FS's.  In fact if any common prefixes exist, that tells
     the attacker that both encrypted FS's probably have the same key,
     also not a good thing.

     Using separate salts helps with this prob but is inconvenient if the
     FS's are removable (such as CD-roms).  Maybe a mount option could
     be added to use the cd-rom volume ID as a salt, so the user
     doesn't have to type a salt at mount time.  When writing the CD
     you'd generate a random string to use as the volume ID.

I also have a question: suppose I have a normal ext3 file system on a
partition.  Can I unmount it, encrypt it in place with aespipe, and
then mount it through the loopback fs?  I don't have another free
partition to transfer to.

Thanks/regards

&gt; 
&gt; http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=7gicpf%24k21%241%40scream.auckland.ac.nz

If attacker can copy your hard drive without your knowledge, he can also
install trojan kernel -- it is 'game over' next time you mount that
encrypted partition. Loop encryption is supposed to protect data _after_
laptop theft or something like that where you won't see or use your laptop
any more.

Your point about about IV computation is still true. If I remember
correctly, PPDD does pre-encryption whitening, so attacker can only detect
which 512 byte sector was changed.
 
&gt; - Since the IV is just an increasing integer sequence, it's not
&gt; completely implausible that some file has sectors whose first
&gt; AES blocks, when xor'd with their sector numbers, give the same
&gt; IV.  Suppose file A begins on sector 536 and its first four
&gt; 32-bit words are 0 0 0 1.  File B begins on sector 537 and its
&gt; first four words are all zero.  This means both files get the
&gt; same IV and if their next several blocks are equal, the attacker
&gt; can tell that.  Colin's scheme helps that; encrypting the IV
&gt; (with a different key than the FS key) before using it would help too.

True. If I could start from scratch without backward compatibility
worries, I would implement IV computing differently.

&gt; - If you have two file systems encrypted with the same key, they
&gt; get the same set of IV's and the attacker can find all the
&gt; sectors that are pairwise equal (or have common prefixes) between
&gt; the two FS's.  In fact if any common prefixes exist, that tells
&gt; the attacker that both encrypted FS's probably have the same key,
&gt; also not a good thing.

Encrypting two filesystems with same seed (salt) is admin screwup. Just
don't do that.

&gt; Using separate salts helps with this prob but is inconvenient if the
&gt; FS's are removable (such as CD-roms).  Maybe a mount option could
&gt; be added to use the cd-rom volume ID as a salt, so the user
&gt; doesn't have to type a salt at mount time.  When writing the CD
&gt; you'd generate a random string to use as the volume ID.

Now, how is the code able to read cd-rom volume ID from encrypted cd-rom? It
is chicken-and-egg problem.

Ugly workaround for this is to add 4096 byte offset to encryption and use
sha512 of first 4096 bytes as the seed. Something like this:

SUM=`head -c 4096 /dev/hda999 | sha512sum`
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda999 /mnt -o \
loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,offset=4096,pseed=${SUM},itercountk=100

Adding a 'pseedoffset=4096' mount option that does that automatically is not
impossible. Just send a patch, or ask me to do it.

&gt; I also have a question: suppose I have a normal ext3 file system on a
&gt; partition.  Can I unmount it, encrypt it in place with aespipe, and
&gt; then mount it through the loopback fs?  I don't have another free
&gt; partition to transfer to.

Yes.

    If attacker can copy your hard drive without your knowledge, he can
    also install trojan kernel -- it is 'game over' next time you mount
    that encrypted partition. 

I don't think so, it's easy to see ways this could happen.  Suppose
you have a file-backed loop_aes FS, and it's backed up periodically as
part of a regular system dump and the backup tapes are archived.  Now
if the attacker gets hold of the series of backup tapes, he has a set
of snapshots of your FS that he can use that attack on.  Or if the
underlying file system is log structured (sectors never get
overwritten unless the whole disk is full, and file operations can be
rolled back), simply getting the hard drive would get all those
snapshots, without needing the tapes.

An attacker who actually accesses the hardware also might choose not
to install any trojans because it increases the chance of detection.
Maybe I boot my laptop from a USB flash disk that I keep in my pocket,
and it validates checksums on the hard drive before going interactive.
Or maybe he wants to install a hardware bug (keystroke recorder), but
he has to assume I check for those.  Installing something like that in
a laptop may not be so easy anyway.

    Loop encryption is supposed to protect data _after_ laptop theft
    or something like that where you won't see or use your laptop any more.

In that case, there's no need to mess with CBC mode or initialization
vectors.  You could just use AES in counter mode over the whole
partition, or use RC4 keyed by a hash of the FS key and the sector
number.  Even doing the hash RC4 key initialization on every sector,
it should still be much faster than AES, for reasonable sector sizes.

I really don't think any of those methods are safe though, even if
you're a device backed loopback FS.  Suppose there's a modern IDE disk
drive underneath and it develops a soft error (i.e. correctable by
ECC) on some sector.  The drive might very well remap that sector to a
spare sector completely invisibly to the OS or the user.  Now if the
attacker gets two versions of the same sector, he can just xor them
together and get back the xor of the two plaintexts.  

CBC mode as currently implemented in loop_aes is somewhat better than
that, but I think Colin's scheme is better still.

    Your point about about IV computation is still true. If I remember
    correctly, PPDD does pre-encryption whitening, so attacker can only
    detect which 512 byte sector was changed.

What's PPDD?  I remember looking at the loop_aes code and didn't
notice any whitening (just plain CBC) but may have missed something.

    True. If I could start from scratch without backward compatibility
    worries, I would implement IV computing differently.

There's already interchangeable block ciphers; might as well have an
alternative chaining mode.

    Encrypting two filesystems with same seed (salt) is admin
    screwup. Just don't do that.

OK.  Docs should emphasize that.

    &gt;      Using separate salts helps with this prob but is inconvenient if the
    &gt;      FS's are removable (such as CD-roms).  Maybe a mount option could
    &gt;      be added to use the cd-rom volume ID as a salt,

    Now, how is the code able to read cd-rom volume ID from encrypted
    cd-rom? It is chicken-and-egg problem.

Oh oops, I thought the volume id was outside the iso9660 FS, but it's not.
Darn.

    Ugly workaround for this is to add 4096 byte offset to encryption and use
    sha512 of first 4096 bytes as the seed. Something like this:

Yeah, I guess that works, though it uses up a sector.  (Why 4096 bytes?
I thought cd-rom had 2048 byte sectors).  I'm trying to think if skipping
the sector has any other bad consequences--I guess not.  Otherwise there
are some further workarounds possible, since the beginning of an ISO9660 
file system appears to be arbitrary (mkisofs puts its own copyright notice
there) so a random string could be put there instead.

Thanks.

&gt; Hi, does placing a seed into the initrg.gz file mean that the only
&gt; way to read off this drive, is to boot off it?  I ask because i'd
&gt; like to make it necessary to boot the hard drive and possibly allow
&gt; for the inclusion of  "safty traps".  There's nothing that can be
&gt; done if the disk is simply mounted in another PC readonly.

You can extract seed from unbooted initrd.gz like this:

    mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /mnt1           # your /boot partition
    gzip -d -c /mnt1/initrd.gz &gt;/mnt1/foo
    mount -r -t minix /mnt1/foo /mnt2 -o loop=/dev/loop0
    strings -a /mnt2/linuxrc | grep losetup
    umount /mnt2
    umount /mnt1

Or from booted initrd.gz like this:

    strings -a /initrd/linuxrc | grep losetup

&gt; The bootup password prompt could accept a few different passwords.
&gt; If forced, the user gives up a "safety trap" password.  This password
&gt; appears to de-crypt fine so the user is off the hook, however this
&gt; password has been setup to run a different bootup script.  Possible
&gt; implementations could allow mounting a crafted fake root, or perhaps
&gt; simply running a "rm -rf" script.  I think something like this would
&gt; greatly improve the security of an encrypted hard drive solution.

gpgkey= mount option allows many users to mount, each using their own
personal key. build-initrd.sh supports GnuPG encrypted keyfiles just fine.

There is no support for 'alternative' filesystem. If there were such thing,
that could be detected by people who know what they are doing. One way of
doing it would be to create a compiled C program that execve()'s losetup
with -o NNNN if suppled password matches some known criteria. You would then
have 2 file systems on the partition, one with offset 0 and other with
offset NNNN. But that is just security through obscurity.

&gt; Secondly,  I'm not sure if the seed is easily recoverable from the
&gt; initrd.gz, i imagine its probably plain (binary) text?  Perhaps we
&gt; could take the same approach as an ssh connection where an initial
&gt; encrypted session is engaged before the real encrypted session is
&gt; initiated.

Check gpgkey= mount option.

&gt; At the moment i have an RC script that echo's my password to losetup,
&gt; as long as my system is on its susceptible to unrelated rooting
&gt; exploits that could expose my precious encryption password ( or
&gt; private key )

Even if RC scripts are protected using root partition encryption, it is not
a requirement to setup other partitions in RC scripts. Setting them up is
just convenient as they can be fsck'd using normal RC scripts.

If an attacker roots your box, he can read any loop encryption key that is
set up at the time he has control of your box. Reading them from RC scripts
is easy. Reading them from kernel RAM is more difficult but doable.

&gt; encrypted container in Windoze XP ? (a kind of loop-aes Windoze port :-/

Dear SIR,
I am Mr.Bliss Marayi and my sister is miss Maureen Marayi we are the children of late \
Chief John Marayi from Sierra Leone.I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily \
to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of 18 Million Dollars($18,000.000.00) \
now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe, the money is in two  \
trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter \
of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my father made them \
to understand  that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner. Source of the money:
My late father Chief John Marayi , a native of  Mende District in the Northerh \
province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation \
(S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father,this money was the income accrued from \
Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales before the peak of the civil war \
between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG \
peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful \
removal from power of the civilian elected President of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the \
rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my \
mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with \
the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with the security firm in Europe through the aid \
of U.N evacuation team. During the war in my country, and following the \
indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the \
Sierra!  Leone mining coop Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My \
father including other top Government functionaries were attacked and killed by the \
rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of \
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my \
uncle's involvement in the air crash in January it dashed our hope of survival.The \
untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of \
which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her \
early this year  . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange \
country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like \
refugees and orphans. Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the \
Security Firm.To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings \
ways. 1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security  Firm as the beneficiary.
2. to transfer this money (USD$18M) in your name to your country.
3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our behalf in your \
country and you, our Adviser/ Manager. For your assistance, I have agreed with my \
younger sister that 20% of the total amount will be for your effort and another 10 % \
to cover all expenses that may be incured during the business transaction, Lastly, I \
urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one knows our where \
about. Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name,address, Tel \
and Fax numbers to me via my private email address as indicated bellow, this is for \
security reasons as i will  only be accessing my private email earnestly awaiting \
your response. Thanks.
May God bless you as you assist us.

Tenders Committee
                              South Africa    Department of
                              Minerals &amp; Energy
                              Pretoria, South Africa.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND URGENT

I am Mr.Zita Harris, a native of Cape Town in South
Africa and I am an Executive Director with a South
African Government ministry. I am also the Secretary of the Tenders 
Committee set up by the government to look into contracts under the 
Department of Minerals and Energy. 

We got your contact via the internet and  I was mandated to seek your 
confidential co-operation in the execution of the project I am about to 
describe. This project will be of great benefit to all parties involved 
and hope you will keep
it as a top secret because of the nature of this
transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy, we (me and four of my 
colleagues) discovered and we have in our possession as overdue payment 
bills totalling
Forteen million, two hundred thousand US dollars
(US$14.2M) which we want to transfer abroad with the
assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to
receive such funds.  Moreso, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
accounts hence your relevance in the whole
transaction.

This amount US$14.2M represents the balance of the
total contract value executed on behalf of this
Department by a foreign contracting firm, which was over-invoiced 
deliberately.  Though the
actual contract cost have been paid to the original
contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the
said amount which we have in principle gotten approval
to remit by key-tested telegraphic transfer (K.T.T.)
to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing
an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners to
propose that SHOULD YOU BE WILLING to assist us in
this transaction, your share of the sum will be 15% of
the total sum, 80% for us and the rest for taxation
and miscellaneous expenses.  The business itself is
100%-SAFE for all involved. This is possible if on your part , you 
treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality.  Please note that your area of
specialisation is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I wish reposed my
confidence (which the committee vetoed) in you and hope that you will 
not
disappoint me.  Endeavour to contact me immediately by
email, whether or not you are interested
in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout
for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. I
want to assure you that my partners and myself are in
a position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided you can give us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secure.  Please
remember to treat this matter as a very confidential
matter, because we will not comprehend with any form
of exposure as we are still in active government
service and.

Due to the funds we borrowed to process this project to this stage, 
time is of essence because of interest on borrowed funds.
Also furnish me with your contact telephone and fax number, so
that I can forward to you more information concerning the project.

I await in anticipation of your fullest cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

Zita Harris

COMer - Programming Language for Component Development



If you are a Windows Programmer, I would like to introduce something
interesting to you.
COMer is a native programming language for COM component development.
A COM component can be easily made in COMer as follow: [File:MyCom.cm]
#ifndef _MYCOM_CM
#define _MYCOM_CM

/*
 * A COM Class
 */
[ clsid = "{EF6CD47E-B844-4219-B582-6F9FE16D45F6}",
  progid = "Dexterity.MyCom1.1",
  helpstring = "Dexterity Com1 Class",
  export, unhandle ]
com CMyCom1
{
  /*
   * An Interface implemented in this class
   */
  [iid="{A123799B-1D8B-4efb-8D43-42AE582767C1}"]
  interface IMyInterface
  {
    method SetValue(int dVal)
    {
      m_dValue = dVal;
      done;
    }

    method GetDoubleValue(int &amp;dVal)
    {
      dVal = m_dValue &lt;&lt; 1;
      done;
    }
  }

  /*
   * Instance variables
   */
  instvars
  {
    int m_dValue;
  }
}

#endif
The design of COMer is native to the concept of the Component Object Model
(COM) mechanism. COM classes are defined as in the way that COM specifies.
Interfaces are specified or defined within a COM class and the methods of
the interfaces are defined within the interfaces. It is simple.
A special characteristic of COMer is that the COMer compiler generates C++
source code files as its final outputs. Therefore, you can use C++ code
within the COMer classes, like Lex, Yacc or MIDL. To build the component,
what you need to do is to specify one more file only to indicate the module
of the component to build.
E.g: [File:MyCom.cmdef]
module: inprocsvr
source { MyCom.cm }
Then, by the following command line (cmc is the COMer compiler program):
&gt; cmc MyCom.cmdef
COMer compiler will generate the following C++ files:
Main.cpp
MyCom.h
MyCom.cpp
MyCom.def
Makefile
Finally, you only need to build these C++ files by using the generated
makefile by C++ build tools. The component 'MyCom.dll' will then be made.
It's so simple!
Lets try it! You will like it!

May it not be a suprise to recieve this letter from me ,considering the fact =
that you do not know me.
First I must seek for your understanding and pray that God will give you the =
wisdom to understand my problem and be in a position to help as you will be =
surely blessed as you help. I am MR OLA WILLIAMS,I am 41 Years old and also =
the chief accountant with Gulf Bank Nig PLC . I have a transaction which I =
think will be of mutual benefit to both of us. In my desire for a foreign =
partner with whom to do this transaction, I stumbled on your contact from a =
business directory.
As the head of accounts department of GBNP, I discovered some amount of
money while I was auditing accounts for the 2001 financial year which has =
been lying there for over 3 years. On further inquiry, I discovered that this =
money totalling about USD$2O.5 Million (Twenty Million! five hundred thousand =
United States Dollars) including accumulated interest which belonged to one =
MR. HUANG L. TANAGA ,a korea Nationale who lived here and died intestate =
without providing
anybody to claim the money.
This man died through a plane crash of ADC airlines in 1998. I have
Successfully secured the money and with the assistance of my colleague, the =
money has been moved out of my bank and deposited in a security company. It =
was packed in three(3)metal trunk boxes as photographic materials. I would =
need your
particulars to enable me prepare documents which will authenticate that the =
Consignment belongs to you as the next of kin to MR. HUANG L. TANAGA and to =
enable you claim the money since nobody has come to claim the money,because =
according to the law here if by the end of this year nobody comes up for the =
money it will be deposited into the government account. I want to be assured =
of a safe account where the money ! will be deposited pending my arrival.
This transaction is absolutely risk free with no legal complications as we =
have made arrangements to secure all the legal documents that will free us =
from any litigation, I have made all necessary arrangements with the security =
company ,that as soon as i get your confirmation of interest in this =
venture,we shall put in all the necessary paper which will authorize the =
security company to lift the funds out of here to their offshore security =
company somewhere in Europe where you will travel to claim the funds . Before =
this money is entrusted into your care, you must assure me that the following =
terms listed below will be maintained between us.
1.BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT FOR ANY REASON CHEAT EACH OTHER.

From Mr Alex Kargbo Alie

Dear SIR,

I am Mr. Alex Kargbo Alie and my sister is Miss Jan Kargbo Alie, we are the 
children of late Chief Kargbo Alie  from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in 
absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of 
thirty  Million Dollars ($30,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private 
Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and 
declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company 
does not know the content as money, although my father made them to under 
stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:

My late father Chief Paul Coleman ,a native of Kailahun District in the 
Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone 
Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money 
was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul 
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost 
destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the 
civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had 
already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, my 
little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with the 
CERTIFICATE OFDEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid 
of U.N evacuation team.

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of 
Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining 
coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including 
other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in 
November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of 
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my ncle's involvement 
in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths 
caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she 
later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her 
early this year  . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this 
strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we 
are now like refugees and orphans.

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm To 
this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the
followings ways.

1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security
 Firm as our beneficiary

2. to transfer this money (USD$30M) in your name to your country

3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our behalf in 
your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager For your assistance, I have agreed 
with my younger sister that 20% of the total amount will be for your effort 
and another 10 % to cover all the expenses that may incur during the business 
transaction, Last, I urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential 
as no one knows our where about.

Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name, address and 
Tel/ Fax numbers, to me via my private email address as indicated bellow, this 
is for security reasons as i will  only be accessing my private email 
earnestly awaiting your response.

                 kargbalie@netscape.net


Thanks.

May God bless you as you assist us.

Mr. ALEX KARGBO ALIE

For whom the bell tolls...........

Twelve monks were about to be ordained. The final test was for them to line
up in a straight row, totally nude, in a garden while a sexy and beautiful
big breasted nude model danced before them. Each monk had a small bell
attached to his p@nis and they were told that anyone whose bell rang when
she danced in front of them would not be ordained because he had not reached
a state of spiritual purity.

The beautiful model danced before the first monk candidate, with no
reaction. She proceeded down the line with the same response from all the
monks until she got to the final monk. As she danced, his bell began to ring
so loudly that it flew off and fell clattering to the ground.

Embarrassed, he took a few steps forward and bent over to pick up the
bell.....And then,...... all the other bells started to ring..........

&gt; &gt; password has been setup to run a different bootup script.  Possible
&gt; &gt; implementations could allow mounting a crafted fake root, or perhaps
&gt; &gt; simply running a "rm -rf" script.  I think something like this would
&gt; &gt; greatly improve the security of an encrypted hard drive solution.
&gt; 
[snip]
&gt; There is no support for 'alternative' filesystem. If there were such thing,
&gt; that could be detected by people who know what they are doing. One way of
&gt; doing it would be to create a compiled C program that execve()'s losetup
&gt; with -o NNNN if suppled password matches some known criteria. You would then
&gt; have 2 file systems on the partition, one with offset 0 and other with
&gt; offset NNNN. But that is just security through obscurity.

I put some more thought to this and came up with this example. Partitions:

/dev/hda1   Unencrypted /boot partition. fdisk partition type 83.

/dev/hda2   Fake encrypted root partition for which you are willing to
            disclose the password when beaten up with a lead pipe. Called
            lead-pipe root thereafter. fdisk partition type 83.

/dev/hda3   Encrypted swap partition. fdisk partition type 82 (Linux Swap).

/dev/hda4   Real encrypted root partition. Called real root thereafter.
            fdisk partition type 82 (Linux Swap).

Both lead-pipe root and real root partitions are set up with same seed and
itercountk, but with different passwords. In this example I used
12345678901234567890 for real root password, and 09876543210987654321 for
lead-pipe root password.

build-initrd.sh configuration:

BOOTDEV=/dev/hda1
BOOTTYPE=ext3
CRYPTROOT=/dev/hda2
ROOTTYPE=ext3
CIPHERTYPE=AES128
PSEED="-S Q+fk9s8SLwepLPQdkBc8"
ITERCOUNTK="-C 100"
USEGPGKEY=0
GPGKEYFILE=rootkey.gpg
USEMODULE=1
USEPIVOT=1
INITRDONLY=1
SOURCEROOT=
DESTINATIONROOT=
DESTINATIONPREFIX=/boot
INITRDGZNAME=initrd.gz
ROOTLOOPINDEX=5
TEMPLOOPINDEX=7
LOOPMODPARAMS=""
USEDEVFS=0
LOADNATIONALKEYB=0
USEROOTSETUP=0

INITRDONLY=1 means that you have to manually copy insmod and losetup to
/boot partition. CRYPTROOT= points to lead-pipe root partition not your real
root partition. Using /dev/hda4 for root partition is achieved by modified
/boot/losetup program. Modified /boot/losetup detects special character in
password and switches to using /dev/hda4. Special password character and
switched to partition can be configured by modifying attached util-linux
patch. In this example, modified /boot/losetup was configured to look for
'2' as the second character in the password.

Both insmod and losetup should be statically linked so they do not require
any external libraries. To create statically linked insmod and losetup, run
these commands before compiling modutils and util-linux packages.

    export CFLAGS="-O2"
    export LDFLAGS="-static -s"

Modutils and util-linux sources are available from usual place:

    ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/
    ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/modutils/v2.4/

Statically linked modified /boot/losetup has these advantages:

1)  You don't need to explain why /sbin/losetup and /boot/losetup are
    different.

2)  For lead-pipe dudes to detect that /boot/losetup is modified, they have
    to disasseble a lot more code. Disassembling stripped statically linked
    program is deeply unfunny exercise.

Interesting /etc/fstab lines of real root file system:

/dev/loop5  /      ext3  defaults                              0  1
/dev/hda1   /boot  ext3  defaults                              0  2
/dev/hda3   none   swap  sw,loop=/dev/loop6,encryption=AES128  0  0

Interesting /etc/fstab lines of lead-pipe root file system:

/dev/loop5  /      ext3  defaults                              0  1
/dev/hda1   /boot  ext3  defaults                              0  2
/dev/hda3   none   swap  sw,loop=/dev/loop6,encryption=AES128  0  0
#/dev/hda4  none   swap  sw,loop=/dev/loop4,encryption=AES128  0  0

As you may have noticed, /dev/hda4 is tagged to be another encrypted swap
partition. It needs to be commented out. If that line is really enabled as
swap, encrypted swap initialization will overwrite some contents of that
partition, destroying your encrypted file system contents. Lead-pipe dudes
can't demand a password for encrypted swap partition because encrypted swap
keys are erased at power off or 'swapoff -a' time. In other words, your real
root partition is disguised as unused encrypted swap partition.

Util-linux patch is below. PASSWORD_2ND_CHAR is the character to look for in
the password. If second character of password is that character, losetup
switches to alternative root device. ALT_ROOT_MAJOR and ALT_ROOT_MINOR
define switched to device. In this example, real root password was
12345678901234567890, so second char is 2. Major 3, minor 4 switches to
/dev/hda4. Some major+minor examples:

MAJOR   MINOR   DEVICE   
 3       1      /dev/hda1
 3       4      /dev/hda4
 3       67     /dev/hdb3
 8       1      /dev/sda1

For more major+minor codes, type "ls -l /dev"

When setting up dual encrypted root partitions like this, it is important
that real root is the switched to device. This is because "losetup -a" and
"ls -l /initrd" disclose clues if root device change took place. No such
clues exist in unaltered boot to lead-pipe partition. Also, if lead-pipe
dudes replace /boot/losetup with unmodified one, they can only boot to
lead-pipe root partition.

One more thing to remember: lilo or grub or whatever bootloader you are
using, must be configured to mount root partition read-write. In initrd
boot, this only affects the initrd ram-disk. Your real encrypted root is of
course mounted read-only so it can be fsck'ed at boot. Initrd needs to be
writable so that modified /boot/losetup can create a block device node there
that represents your real root device. That node could be created by
build-initrd.sh script but that would disclose presence of real root too
easily.

Yes, that leaks some information about which cipher block was the first one

&gt; overwritten unless the whole disk is full, and file operations can be
&gt; rolled back), simply getting the hard drive would get all those
&gt; snapshots, without needing the tapes.

If filesystem blocks are written to different sectors, they are encrypted
with different IV. Your point was about detecting changes to same sector.

&gt; An attacker who actually accesses the hardware also might choose not
&gt; to install any trojans because it increases the chance of detection.
&gt; Maybe I boot my laptop from a USB flash disk that I keep in my pocket,
&gt; and it validates checksums on the hard drive before going interactive.
&gt; Or maybe he wants to install a hardware bug (keystroke recorder), but
&gt; he has to assume I check for those.  Installing something like that in
&gt; a laptop may not be so easy anyway.

Yes, USB or CDROM boot would be more secure.

&gt;     Loop encryption is supposed to protect data _after_ laptop theft
&gt;     or something like that where you won't see or use your laptop any more.
&gt; 
&gt; In that case, there's no need to mess with CBC mode or initialization
&gt; vectors.  You could just use AES in counter mode over the whole
&gt; partition, or use RC4 keyed by a hash of the FS key and the sector
&gt; number.  Even doing the hash RC4 key initialization on every sector,
&gt; it should still be much faster than AES, for reasonable sector sizes.

IV + CBC reduce chances of identical cipherblocks. And identical
cipherblocks leak information.

&gt; I really don't think any of those methods are safe though, even if
&gt; you're a device backed loopback FS.  Suppose there's a modern IDE disk
&gt; drive underneath and it develops a soft error (i.e. correctable by
&gt; ECC) on some sector.  The drive might very well remap that sector to a
&gt; spare sector completely invisibly to the OS or the user.  Now if the
&gt; attacker gets two versions of the same sector, he can just xor them
&gt; together and get back the xor of the two plaintexts.

xor trick works with CTR mode, but not with CBC mode.

&gt; CBC mode as currently implemented in loop_aes is somewhat better than
&gt; that, but I think Colin's scheme is better still.

I never said Colin's wasn't better. I agree 100% with you.

&gt;     Your point about about IV computation is still true. If I remember
&gt;     correctly, PPDD does pre-encryption whitening, so attacker can only
&gt;     detect which 512 byte sector was changed.
&gt; 
&gt; What's PPDD?  I remember looking at the loop_aes code and didn't
&gt; notice any whitening (just plain CBC) but may have missed something.

PPDD == Allan Latham's PPDD

http://linux01.gwdg.de/~alatham/ppdd.html

&gt;     True. If I could start from scratch without backward compatibility
&gt;     worries, I would implement IV computing differently.
&gt; 
&gt; There's already interchangeable block ciphers; might as well have an
&gt; alternative chaining mode.

I have been considering that for more than a year now. Tricky part is doing
it without creating (in)compatibility mess. Just look at SuSE twofish /
kerneli.org twofish and their incompatible IV computing mess and you
understand what I mean.

&gt;     Ugly workaround for this is to add 4096 byte offset to encryption and use
&gt;     sha512 of first 4096 bytes as the seed. Something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I guess that works, though it uses up a sector.  (Why 4096 bytes?
&gt; I thought cd-rom had 2048 byte sectors).  I'm trying to think if skipping
&gt; the sector has any other bad consequences--I guess not.

2048 sould work ok for cdrom. 4096 was just 'always safe' choice.

&gt; Otherwise there
&gt; are some further workarounds possible, since the beginning of an ISO9660
&gt; file system appears to be arbitrary (mkisofs puts its own copyright notice
&gt; there) so a random string could be put there instead.

Another chicken-and-egg problem. You can't encrypt before you know the seed.
And if seed is sha512sum of some ciphertext....

Loop device /dev/loop7 is already set up for some other use. "make tests"
tries to use that same /dev/loop7 too, and fails. To display what loops are
being used, type "losetup -a".

Hi,

what gcc flags and #include-s are required to 
compile the examples provided with crypto-API?

Example code:

#include &lt;linux/crypto.h&gt;

struct cipher_context*
setup_cipher (const char *ciphername, const u8 *key,
u32 keylen)
{
  int error = 0;
  struct cipher_context *cx = NULL;

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system
Archive:       http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/


</body></email><email><emailId>20031210043511</emailId><senderName>Ben Slusky</senderName><senderEmail>sluskyb@paranoiacs.org</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-12-10 04:35:11-0400</timestampReceived><subject>hashalot 0.2.0</subject><body>

Hi everybody,

I've just uploaded hashalot 0.2.0: New features:
- Support for salted passphrases.
- New supported hash: "rmd160compat" -- does a RIPEMD160 hash and then
  truncates it to 16 bytes, like the old kerneli.org patch did (and
  Debian still does). Thanks to Clemens for the patch.

Also made a small change to the losetup patch, to fix a bug that could
be triggered if one were to change the extra args to the keygen program
(which are compile-time constants... IOW don't worry about it).

Hashalot and my losetup patches are available at
&lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/&gt;

Andries: we seem to be coming up on the 2.6.0 release, it would be nice if
the stock losetup could work with the stock kernel to create an encrypted
loop device. What do you think about merging my patches?

The Word of the Day for December 10 is:

clew • \KLOO\ Audio icon • noun
	1 : a ball of thread, yarn, or cord *2 : clue 3 a : a lower corner or only
the after corner of a sail b : a metal loop attached to the lower corner of
a sail c plural : a combination of lines by which a hammock is suspended

Example sentence:

"They had followed immediately behind him, thinking his actions might prove
a clew to my whereabouts. . . ." (Edgar Rice Burroughs, A Princess of Mars)

Did you know?

The "ball of thread" meaning of "clew" (from Middle English "clewe" and
ultimately from Old English "cliewen") has been with us since before the
12th century. The variant "clue" had come into use by the 16th century.
Because balls of thread were used to escape from labyrinths in various
mythological stories (such as the story of Theseus in Crete), "clew" and
"clue" came to be used of anything that could guide a person through a
difficult place. This use led in turn to the meaning "a piece of evidence
that leads one toward the solution of a problem." Today, "clue" is the more
common spelling variant for the "evidence" sense, but you’ll find "clew" in
some famous works of literature. "Clew" is also the only choice for the
sailing and hammock senses.

[Attachment #2 (MULTIPART/mixed)]


Le  8 Déc, Pour: linux-crypto@nl.linux.org a écrit :
&gt; After that, I tried to apply patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 to kernel. I
&gt; noticed that a new cryptoloop option appears. As it disables crypto
&gt; ciphers if enabling it I let it disabled. This time, the losetup seemed
&gt; to function but then fsck.ext3 -n /dev/loop7 never succeeded in finding
&gt; a superblock. 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that cryptoapi is installed but I must miss something.
&gt; I'm not sure jari patch is needed since I never used it before.
&gt; 

OK I found it. The problem came from... make xconfig !!!

The cryptloop-jari patch is mandatory since it is the only way you have
loop_xfer calls in the kernel to load ciphers. But, if you use make
xconfig like me, then the patch breaks the compilation of cryptoapi.

The problem comes from the fact that xconfig try to parse the script
file in a different way as the shell in order to display grayed boxes
when something is disabled. Hence, when you have

if [ "$CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP" = "m" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET_AH" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET_AH" = "m" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET_ESP" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET_ESP" = "m" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET6_AH" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET6_AH" = "m" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET6_ESP" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_INET6_ESP" = "m" ]; then
  define_bool CONFIG_CRYPTO y
else
  bool 'Cryptographic API' CONFIG_CRYPTO
fi

and the condition is "true" for a shell you enable CONFIG_CRYPTO whereas
for xconfig you gray the box in the else part and... disable
CONFIG_CRYPTO !

Attached is a new crypto/Config.in file that should work with make
config and make xconfig. I just duplicated the true statements.

Fortunately, when digging in xconfig sources I found a comment saying it
is at the end of its life cycle... I don't rember the date of this
statement ;-)

The Word of the Day for December 11 is:

rarefied • \RAIR-uh-fide\ Audio icon • adjective
	*1 : of, relating to, or interesting to a select group : esoteric 2 : very
high

Example sentence:

Cartography is one of those rarefied fields, like vexillology and tea
tasting, at which only a select few can actually earn a living.

Did you know?

"Rarefied" was formed from the verb "rarefy," which derives from a
combination of the Latin "rarus" ("thin" or "rare") with "facere" ("to
make") and has meant "to make thin" since the 14th century. In its original
uses back in the 1600s, the adjective "rarefied" was on the lean side too;
it meant "made less dense" (as in "the fog lifted and we could breathe more
easily in the rarefied air"). By the 16th century, "rarefy" had gained the
sense "to refine or purify." Over time "rarefied" followed suit; by the
1940s it was being used to mean "only for the select."

From the desk of Engr, Sadiq abbas.

Dear Sir, 

We are sending this letter to you based on information 

Gathered from the foreign trade office of the Nigerian 

Chamber of commerce and industry. We believe that you 

Would be in a position to help us in our bid to 

Transfer the sum of forty-0ne million, five hundred 

Thousand dollars ($41.5m usd) into a foreign account. 

We are members of the special committee for budget and 

Planning of the ministry of petroleum, this committee 

Is principally concerned with contract appraisals and 

Approval of contracts in order of priorities as 

Regards capital project of the federal government of 

Nigeria. With our positions, we have successfully 

Secured for ourselves the sum of forty-one million, 

Five hundred thousand united state 

Dollars(us$41.5m).the present government in my country 

Are seeking re-election for that they want the support 

Of foreign government so they have given directive to 

All federal parastatals to settle all foreign 

Contractors being owed for contract that they has 

Done, so our plan is to include the name that you will 

Provide as one of the contractors being owed in my 

Corporation. 

What we need from you is to provide a safe account 

Into which the funds will be transferred since 

Government officials are not allowed by our laws to 

Operate foreign account. It has been agreed that the 

Owner of the account will be compensated with us$8.3 

Million of the remitted funds, we keep 

Us$31.125million while us$2.075million will be set 

Aside to offset expenses and pays the necessary taxes. 

It may interest you to know that two years ago a 

Similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. 

Patrice miller, the president of craine international 

Trading corporation at number 135, east 57th street, 

28th floor, New York 10022 with telephone 

(212)308-7788 and telex number 6731689, after the 

Agreement between both partners in which he was to 

Take 25% the money was duly transferred into his 

Account only to be disappointed on our arrival in new 

York as we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice 

Miller was no longer on that address while his 

Telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to 

Somebody else, that is how we lost us$27.5m to Mr. 

Patrice miller. 

This time around we need a more reliable and 

Trustworthy person or a reputable company to do 

Business with hence this letter to you, so if you can 

Prove yourself to be trusted and interested in this 

Deal then we are prepared to do business with you. 

What we want from you is the assurance that you will 

Let us have our share when this amount of us$41.5m is 

Transferred into your account. 

If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me 

Through e-mail stated above so we can advice you on 

The modalities of the transaction. All modalities of 

The transfer have been worked out and once started 

Will not take more than 14 working days with the 

Absolute support of all concerned. This transaction is 

100% safe. 

Please treat as urgent and very confidential. God be 

With you as I look forward to your reply.

Hi all,

I'm sorry to ask a question that must have a simple answer but despite
careful reading of the archive, I didn't succeed in deciphering
partitions after upgrade from 2.4.21 to 2.4.23.

My configuration before upgrade:
2.4.21-pre4 with a few patches (acpi, swsusp) including
loop-hvr-2_4_18_1.patch
patch-int-2.4.18.3.bz2

losetup compiled from 
 util-linux-2.11u.tar.bz2
 util-linux-2.11r.patch.bz2
mount version 2.11u (I don't remember if it results from the compilation
of above or if it's the mandrake 9.0 version)

I use a bunch of scripts using gpg to store password phrase on an usb
keys. The following just worked correctly:
losetup --encryption aes --keybits 256 --phash sha256 /dev/loop7 /dev/sda4 &lt; keyfile
and in the auto.usb automount file
cipher          -fstype=ext3            :/dev/loop7

Now, I have upgraded to:
2.4.23 with patch swsusp
&gt;From what I understand there's no more need to use international patch
nor hvr loop patch but I included
patch-aes-asm-2.4.22.0

losetup was recompiled from
 util-linux-2.12.tar.gz
 losetup-variable-key-size-mk6.patch
 losetup-keygen-prog-mk7.patch

I also downloaded and compiled
 hashalot-0.1.0.tar.gz

After installing all these, I loaded aes module
cat /proc/crypto
name         : aes
module       : aes
type         : cipher
blocksize    : 16
min keysize  : 16
max keysize  : 32
ivsize       : 16


then tried
hashalot-0.1.0/hashalot sha256 &lt; keyfile | losetup -p 0 -e aes-256 /dev/loop7 /dev/sda4
but I obtained 
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
I also tried 
hashalot-0.1.0/hashalot sha256 &lt; keyfile | losetup -p 0 -e aes-cbc-256 /dev/loop7 /dev/sda4
with same result and even 
hashalot-0.1.0/hashalot sha256 &lt; keyfile | losetup -p 0 -e aes /dev/loop7 /dev/sda4
which gives 
You must specify a key size (in bits) for use with CryptoAPI encryption.

After that, I tried to apply patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 to kernel. I
noticed that a new cryptoloop option appears. As it disables crypto
ciphers if enabling it I let it disabled. This time, the losetup seemed
to function but then fsck.ext3 -n /dev/loop7 never succeeded in finding
a superblock. 

It seems to me that cryptoapi is installed but I must miss something.
I'm not sure jari patch is needed since I never used it before.

Thanks for any help.

Hello everyone!

I have created a configuration of three 60 GB
disk which form one a raid5 array. This array 
is parted by lvm. Is it possible to safely use
loop-aes on one of the logical volumes?

I began to doubt: After I created a new logical
volume, created the loop-device and created a
XFS file system, I could only mount it once.

Upon mounting it the second time xfs says:

raid5: switching cache buffer sise, 4096 
       --&gt; 512
raid5: switching cache buffer sise, 512 
       --&gt; 1024
raid5: switching cache buffer sise, 1024 
       --&gt; 512
raid5: switching cache buffer sise, 512
       --&gt; 4096
XFS: mounting filesystem loop(7,7)
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 4096
       --&gt; 512
XFS: log inconsistent or no log (last==0, 
first!= 1)
XFS: empty log check failed
XFS: log mount/recovery failed
XFS: log mount failed

Reiserfs and EXT3 don't complain. They seem to
work and remount ok, but I dare to trust data 
this filesystem before I know what the issue is
about. 

Do you have a clue? Kernel is SuSE 2.4.21-144, 
loop-aes is 1.7e. 


Kind regards,
Terje

</body></email><email><emailId>20031214114316</emailId><senderName>David Belohrad</senderName><senderEmail>david.belohrad@cern.ch</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-12-14 11:43:16-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Kernel Migration</subject><body>

Hi all,
please is there somewhere consistent talk about migration of cryptoapi 
when changing the kernel?
In my case:

-- I have linux kernel 'Linux localhost 2.4.21-0.13mdkcustom-dejfson #6 
Èt dub 10 23:29:41 CEST 2003 i686 unknown unknown GNU/Linux', which is 
mdk 2.4.21
with added support for 'old' cryptoapi (= loop-jari + int patch).
-- because of security I want to move to 2.4.23 kernel. The problem is, 
that 2.4.23 already has some 'strange' version of CryptoAPI inside, so 
if I want to add my old
cryptoapi support, the patches are confusing the kernel.
-- for this I've found in this mailing conference how to make it with 
the crypto what is in kernel (adding patch 
patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 to vanilla 2.4.23). This
works without problem, but when I go to make xconfig, and I select loop 
device and cryptoloop device (as modules), the cryptographic support is 
then completely
grayed, so I cannot make a selection of the cipher I have (twofish-256).
-- if I compile the system as it is (with grayed ciphers), i compile 
util-linux + hashalot, then when I try to mount, it says that the cipher 
is not existing.
....................
-- ok, another try: i've hacked little Config.in from crypto not to have 
tristate buttons in cryptoapi menu, then I've selected to compile loop, 
cryptoloop, two-fish (as module)
-- compile -- ok, makes module of twofish
-- insmod cryptoloop, twofish = ok
-- compile util-linux, -- ok
.....................
try to mount:

sha256 | ./losetup -p0 -e twofish-256 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb
mount /dev/loop0 /pool

........... incorrect fs type....

so some questions:

where I do the mistake?
what is the difference between manual patched cryptoapi (ie it creates 
in kernel directory /crypto, /crypto/ciphers, /crypto/cryptoloop...) and
the cryptoapi which is already in the kernel 2.4.22?
what is the correct migration to be able to mount the 'old' cryptoapi 
with new kernel cryptoapi? (i have 120gb disk encrypted with twofish, so 
i cannot simply make
a new partition and copy there all the data to be able to make new 
cryptoapi partition)
is there any document to read about all the 'loop' and other patches?? 
there is a lot of patches, which do different things...

thanks for answers

&gt; patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 to vanilla 2.4.23). This
&gt; works without problem, but when I go to make xconfig, and I select loop 
&gt; device and cryptoloop device (as modules), the cryptographic support is 
&gt; then completely
&gt; grayed, so I cannot make a selection of the cipher I have (twofish-256).
&gt; -- if I compile the system as it is (with grayed ciphers), i compile 
&gt; util-linux + hashalot, then when I try to mount, it says that the cipher 
&gt; is not existing.
&gt; ....................
&gt; -- ok, another try: i've hacked little Config.in from crypto not to have 
&gt; tristate buttons in cryptoapi menu, then I've selected to compile loop, 
&gt; cryptoloop, two-fish (as module)
&gt; -- compile -- ok, makes module of twofish
&gt; -- insmod cryptoloop, twofish = ok
&gt; -- compile util-linux, -- ok
&gt; .....................
&gt; try to mount:
&gt; 
&gt; sha256 | ./losetup -p0 -e twofish-256 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb
&gt; mount /dev/loop0 /pool
&gt; 
&gt; ........... incorrect fs type....
&gt; 
&gt; so some questions:
&gt; 
&gt; where I do the mistake?
&gt; what is the difference between manual patched cryptoapi (ie it creates 
&gt; in kernel directory /crypto, /crypto/ciphers, /crypto/cryptoloop...) and
&gt; the cryptoapi which is already in the kernel 2.4.22?
&gt; what is the correct migration to be able to mount the 'old' cryptoapi 
&gt; with new kernel cryptoapi? (i have 120gb disk encrypted with twofish, so 
&gt; i cannot simply make
&gt; a new partition and copy there all the data to be able to make new 
&gt; cryptoapi partition)
&gt; is there any document to read about all the 'loop' and other patches?? 
&gt; there is a lot of patches, which do different things...
&gt;

  shared writable mappings to a file, (4) memory mapped file data modified

Is there a point to using loop-AES with kernel-2.6? CryptoAPI is in the kernel.
Why not just use it?

1)  Loop-AES is about twice as fast on modern x86 boxes.
2)  Kernel 2.6 cryptoloop will not work properly with encrypted swap.
    Encrypted swap needs memory pre-allocation.
3)  kerneli.org and mainline versions are more than two years behind in
    security. Both have exploitable vulnerability that is best described as
    back door.
4)  Uncounted number of bugs fixed in loop-AES that still bite mainline.
5)  If Andrew Morton's loop changes get merged to mainline loop, kernel 2.6

Ahh.. That makes sense. So, even if I am running 2.6.0 I still would want to
patch the kernel with loop-AES. 

I am somewhat new to the whole kernel paching process. If the cryptoloop is
already included in the 2.6 kernel, how do you tell the difference between
the stock cryptoloop and the loop-AES cryptoloop?

Hi,

I've created encrypted cdroms some time ago, and I am
able to mount them with a 2.4.21 kernel patched with:
patch-int-2.4.21.0.bz2
loop-jari-2.4.21.0.patch

And just using:
losetup -k 256 -e serpent /dev/loop0 /dev/cdrom
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /cdrom

losetup /dev/loop0 shows that it is using
(serpent-cbc), encryption type 18.

The losetup is the 2.12 supplied by Debian Sid
(2.12-6).

When I use the 2.6.0-test10 kernel and load the
serpent and cryptoloop patches, doing the same results
in an error message stating that there's no filesystem
on the loopback.
"mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock ..."

When using losetup /dev/loop0, it shows that it is
using "encryption serpent (type 18)" without any
indication of using cbc, ebc, ...

So, I tried specifying it explicitly:
losetup -k 256 -e serpent-cbc /dev/loop0 /dev/cdrom
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /cdrom


I read about the hashalot tool and tried it with
ripemd160, rmd160 and rmd160compat in combination with
and without the -N flag of losetup, both with and
without the -cbc postfix for the encryption type.

--nohashpass, -N
  Don't hash the password given.  (previous versions
hash, non-debian doesn't.


My question is: Is it possible to mount my encrypted
filesystems with a 2.6.x kernel or will I have to
convert all my CDROMs...?

If it is possible, does it require some patches to the
2.6.x kernel although it has the cryptostuff included?

I've searched the web, searched the mailinglist and
found that most are using AES. I didn't find any
answer to my question, so I'm asking for help on this
mailinglist. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

Regards
Alex

when using the kernel crypt modules (cryptoloop and the crypt-algorithms)
from 2.6.0-test9 and doing a
        losetup -e twofish /dev/loop0 /cryptfile
i dont get the question for the keysize. so, i have two questions myself:

- how can i choose the keysize?
- what size will be implicitly taken?

How about this one? Your patch had little bit messed up parameter and
environment processing. This version simply copies what kernel passed to
linuxrc and passes them directly to init. This version also includes the
insmod.modutils patch that you sent me earlier.

When sending patches for loop-AES, please CC me if you want me to see them.
I'm usually subscribed to linux-crypto list, but every now and then I get
silently dropped from the list.  :(

I've been using reiserfs on cryptoapi for several 
years without trouble. I've also been running encrypted
swap using cryptoapi on numerous machines with no 
problems at all.

Either Jari's code or cryptoapi with jari's patch
are effective and reliable solutions.

Okay, perhaps I did not clarify exactly what i would like to have. 
Thanks to the people who already replied, it helped somehow. But please, 
I have big mess
in what I know. Could someone tell me:

- I have 2 cryptoapi systems

compiled in. I've compiled utils-linux 2.11x with patch for cryptoapi.

          question: what's wrong? are the two systems compatible??

David Belohrad napsal(a):

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; please is there somewhere consistent talk about migration of cryptoapi 
&gt; when changing the kernel?
&gt; In my case:
&gt;
&gt; -- I have linux kernel 'Linux localhost 2.4.21-0.13mdkcustom-dejfson 
&gt; #6 Èt dub 10 23:29:41 CEST 2003 i686 unknown unknown GNU/Linux', which 
&gt; is mdk 2.4.21
&gt; with added support for 'old' cryptoapi (= loop-jari + int patch).
&gt; -- because of security I want to move to 2.4.23 kernel. The problem 
&gt; is, that 2.4.23 already has some 'strange' version of CryptoAPI 
&gt; inside, so if I want to add my old
&gt; cryptoapi support, the patches are confusing the kernel.
&gt; -- for this I've found in this mailing conference how to make it with 
&gt; the crypto what is in kernel (adding patch 
&gt; patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 to vanilla 2.4.23). This
&gt; works without problem, but when I go to make xconfig, and I select 
&gt; loop device and cryptoloop device (as modules), the cryptographic 
&gt; support is then completely
&gt; grayed, so I cannot make a selection of the cipher I have (twofish-256).
&gt; -- if I compile the system as it is (with grayed ciphers), i compile 
&gt; util-linux + hashalot, then when I try to mount, it says that the 
&gt; cipher is not existing.
&gt; ....................
&gt; -- ok, another try: i've hacked little Config.in from crypto not to 
&gt; have tristate buttons in cryptoapi menu, then I've selected to compile 
&gt; loop, cryptoloop, two-fish (as module)
&gt; -- compile -- ok, makes module of twofish
&gt; -- insmod cryptoloop, twofish = ok
&gt; -- compile util-linux, -- ok
&gt; .....................
&gt; try to mount:
&gt;
&gt; sha256 | ./losetup -p0 -e twofish-256 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb
&gt; mount /dev/loop0 /pool
&gt;
&gt; ........... incorrect fs type....
&gt;
&gt; so some questions:
&gt;
&gt; where I do the mistake?
&gt; what is the difference between manual patched cryptoapi (ie it creates 
&gt; in kernel directory /crypto, /crypto/ciphers, /crypto/cryptoloop...) and
&gt; the cryptoapi which is already in the kernel 2.4.22?
&gt; what is the correct migration to be able to mount the 'old' cryptoapi 
&gt; with new kernel cryptoapi? (i have 120gb disk encrypted with twofish, 
&gt; so i cannot simply make
&gt; a new partition and copy there all the data to be able to make new 
&gt; cryptoapi partition)
&gt; is there any document to read about all the 'loop' and other patches?? 
&gt; there is a lot of patches, which do different things...
&gt;
&gt; thanks for answers

I ran into the bug a few days ago. Here is a
corrected crypto/Config.in file for xconfig users. The real bug is in
xconfig way of interpreting Config.in files. This is just a workaround.

&gt; I have created a configuration of three 60 GB

&gt; 
&gt; I began to doubt: After I created a new logical
&gt; volume, created the loop-device and created a
&gt; XFS file system, I could only mount it once.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon mounting it the second time xfs says:
&gt;

&gt; Reiserfs and EXT3 don't complain. They seem to
&gt; work and remount ok, but I dare to trust data
&gt; this filesystem before I know what the issue is
&gt; about.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a clue? Kernel is SuSE 2.4.21-144,
&gt; loop-aes is 1.7e.

Exact mount syntax that you used may be relevant. To be more exact, I am
interested in presense of -r option.

&gt; option.

The exact syntax was:

mount /dev/loop7 /vol

However, read-only mounting the file system produces
exactly the same results.

xfs_repair says on the unmountable file system:

...
Phase 2 - using internal log
        - zero log
XFS: Log inconsistent or not a log (last==0,
     first!=1)
XFS: empty log check failed
zero_log: cannot find log head/tail
          (xlog_find_tail=22), zeroing it anyway
...

After this the file system is mountable for
one time again. 

In the meanwhile I restored a few gigabytes of
data onto the filesystem, now formatted with 
reiserfs, remounted a few times, run reiserfsck
a few times. Currently the system is comparing 
the integrity of the data. With reiserfs every
thing goes smoothly so far.

Terje

Two more additions: I double checked that this
problem actually does _not_ happen, when I use
xfs on lvm on raid5 without loop-aes in between.

And I could positively verify 4.5 GB data on a 
30 GB logical volume through loop-aes with reiserfs.

So at the end this this looks like some compatibility
problem between xfs and loop-aes. I will try xfs 
through loop-aes on a plain partition tomorrow.

Terje

Mounting file system without specifying file system type, is usually a bad
idea. If file system type is not specified, mount has try all file systems
until one succeeds. This can cause all sorts of trouble.

True, but unfortunately adding "-t xfs" makes no
difference here. 

I have restored and verified 50 GB data on reiserfs
once and on ext3 once, so I guess it works ok me.

Additionally, I verified that xfs on loop-aes on a 
plain partition works perfectly. So reproducing the
problem requires at least xfs AND loop-aes AND (lvm
OR raid).

Nontheless, thanks very much for your time.

Kind Regards,
Terje

I think this mystery is now solved.

XFS file system attempts to optimize I/O transfers to underlying device. It
may do variable length partial page transfers. However it also understands
that some devices get really pissed with variable length transfers (raid
devices for example), and attempts to avoid variable length transfers on
those devices.

Case #1:  XFS --&gt; PARTITION
    XFS uses variable length transfers. Disk driver handles them okay.
    No problems here.

Case #2:  XFS --&gt; LOOP --&gt; PARTITION
    XFS uses variable length transfers. Loop handles them okay and pass them
    to underlying disk driver. Disk driver handles them okay. No problems
    here.

Case #3:  XFS --&gt; RAID --&gt; PARTITIONS
    XFS detects problematic raid device and does not use variable length
    transfers. Neither raid nor disk driver sees variable length transfers.
    No problems here.

Case #4:  XFS --&gt; LOOP --&gt; RAID --&gt; PARTITIONS
    XFS does not detect problematic device and uses variable length
    transfers. Loop handles them ok and pass them to underlying raid driver.
    Raid driver gets really pissed here.

I have included one-liner patch for XFS that teaches XFS not to send
variable length I/O requests to loop device. XFS really does not know what
kind of device is below loop device.

I still see raid code emitting those "switching cache buffer size" kernel
messages in case #4, but case #3 emits those messages too.

&gt; I think this mystery is now solved.

&gt; I have included one-liner patch for XFS that
&gt; teaches XFS not to send variable length I/O 
&gt; requests to loop device. XFS really does not
&gt; know what kind of device is below loop device.

Thanks a lot for your time! I can't take down 
the system now to start the modified kernel
(unfortunately xfs is not a module), but I 
will try and report on sunday!

Kind regards, 
Terje

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span class=GramE&gt;refund&lt;/span&gt; 100% of all your money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Never in the history of network &lt;span class=GramE&gt;marketing
has&lt;/span&gt; a company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span class=GramE&gt;offered&lt;/span&gt; a true 100% money back guarantee
on the amount&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span class=GramE&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; spend if you don't make $2,700+
by your sixth month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span class=GramE&gt;reason&lt;/span&gt; for it. You bought hype

&gt; 
&gt; I still see raid code emitting those "switching
&gt; cache buffer size" kernel messages in case #4, but 
&gt; case #3 emits those messages too.

Your patch definitely makes this scenario work. I 
ran my usual restore-and-verify-script over night 
with the patched xfs driver and it all seems ok. 

Interestingly I see a lot more "switching cache 
buffer size" messages than before - Especially some
strange consecutive switches from 0 to 512 bytes at
mount time.

However, thanks a lot!

Quoting David Belohrad &lt;david.belohrad@cern.ch&gt;:

&gt;                                                 /sbin/losetup -e twofish

 &lt;...&gt;
&gt;              -- sha256 | ./losetup -p0 -e twofish-256 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb

These two command lines are not the same. If you did not specify a hash under
the old util-linux-2.11* patches then the default was RIPEMD160, not SHA256.
Try using the rmd160 hash, or rmd160compat if that fails.

For the record neither hashalot nor cryptoloop use the CryptoAPI hash
algorithms. So far only IPsec does (AFAIK).

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE

 
Dear Sir/Madam

You may be surprise to receive this letter from me, since you don't know me \
personally; I am MICKY KARUBI the son of YENGENI KARUBI who was recently murdered in \
a land dispute in Zimbabwe.

I am writing this letter to request your assistance and confidentiality to handle a \
transfer of fund into a Foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father \
was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents \
of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe, for his alleged support and \
sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority, Before \
my fathers death, he has taken to Europe via Johannesburg  the sum of fifteen  \
Million, Five hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($15.5 million)with a Security \
and Finance Company as if he foreseen the looming danger in Zimbabwe.

This money was allocated for the purchase of new Machinery and chemical products for \
Agro allied farm and for the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. \
These land problems arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that \
wholly affected the rich white farmers, and the blacks vehemently condemned the \
"modus operandi" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant Killings and mob \
action by the war veterans and some political thugs, precisely more than three \
thousands (3,000) people have so far been killed. 

Heads of government from some commonwealth states,and west, especially Britain and \
United States have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plans. Subsequently, South \
Africa Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land \
act, it is against this background that my entire family who are currently residing \
in South Africa have decided to transfer my father's money into a foreign account. As \
the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a \
genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge \
of my government who are tactically freezing our family's wealth and South Africa \
government seem to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of \
investing this money in South Africa for the fear of encountering the same experience \
in the future, since both countries have the same political history.

More so, The South Africa Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment, \
Hence I am seeking for political asylum in The Netherlands. As a business person whom \
I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that \
this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not \
necessarily matter. For your assistance, we are offering you 20% of the sum 70% for \
me and my family, while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incurred \
during this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial properties based \
on your advice. Finally, I will demand for assurance that you will not sit on the \
money when it gets to your personal or company account in your country.

If this proposal is accepted by you, please confirm your interest by sending me an \
email mickykarubi@netscape.net 

 

God Bless you,

Micky Karubi

For encrypted swap I recommend loop code + swapon from loop-AES-v2.0d
package. That swapon will set up loop in more secure multi-key mode with MD5
IV.

For file system encryption, loop-AES-v2.0d with multi-key and MD5 IV is also
the most secure implementation currently available that I am aware of.

&gt; &gt; 5)  If Andrew Morton's loop changes get merged to mainline loop, kernel 2.6

&gt; &gt;     (same why reason I don't recommend using journaled file systems with
&gt; &gt;     file backed loops)
&gt; 
&gt; Has journaling file systems ever been recommended when using cryptoloop?

Device backed loops should work ok with loop-AES.

</body></email><email><emailId>20031222020520</emailId><senderName>Jeff Buckley</senderName><senderEmail>agn0st2000@yahoo.co.uk</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-12-22 02:05:20-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Re: Problem using pre 2.4.21 EFS in 2.6.0</subject><body>

Hi,

Finally I figured it out! I always thought the
loop-AES and patch-int-2.4.x.0.bz2 patches were
totally incompatible so I never even tried to use the
loop-AES stuff since I've got many encrypted volumes
which I really do not want to convert.

Now it appears that just getting the loop-AES and
ciphers packages and reading the included README file
was enough to get everything working! :-) Yay!


So, anyone still having problems mounting his
encrypted filesystems with 2.4.22 or 2.6.0 kernels,
get loop-AES even if you didn't use it before!

(Actually, the README file included in loop-AES very
cleary describes how to do just that.)


I got the loop-AES-v2.0d.tar.bz2 package and the
ciphers-v2.0d.tar.bz2 packages. Did a make in the both
unpacked directories and loaded the cryptoloop, loop
and loop_serpent modules. Patched the util-linux-2.12
unpacked directory with the patch included in the
loop-AES tarball:
patch -p1  &lt;../loop-AES-v2.0d/util-linux-2.12.diff

Did a make in the lib and mount directories. Ran the
losetup:
./losetup -e serpent256 -H rmd160 -I 2 /dev/loop0
/dev/cdrom
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /cdrom

And it worked just fine! :-D

Regards,
Alex

I fixed the file access issue using the same way used in loop-aes.
Now it seems working as should and I put some more documentation in the 
userspace tool tar.bz2. The patch applies cleandly against linux-2.6.0
Get everything from http://dev.gentoo.org/~lu_zero/gcloop

I know that the code is still quite dirty, any help is welcome.

This is a multi-part message in MIME format

From: Mrs Sarah Edwards,
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr.Steven Edwards =
who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died =
in the year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died =
after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we =
were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or =
get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my =
late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$12Million (Twelve Million =
United States Dollars) with one Finance/Security company in Central =
Europe.Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.Recently,my =
Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer =
problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my =
condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian =
individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct =
herein.
I want a church that will use this fund to fund churches, orphanages and
widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  that the house of God is =
maintained. The Bible advise us to understand that Blessed is the hand that =
giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my =
husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of =
the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and

&lt;td&gt;Dear PayPal User,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today we had some trouble with one of our
computer systems. While the trouble appears to be minor, we are not taking
any chances. We decided to take the troubled system offline and replace it
with a new system. Unfortunately this caused us to lose some member data.
Please follow the link below and log into your account to make sure your
information is not affected. &lt;i&gt;Account balances have not been
affected.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of the inconvenience this causes we are
giving all users that repair their missing data their next two incoming
transfers for free! You will pay no fees for your next two incoming

with the -k option, so losetup -e twofish -k 256 will give you a keysize

Dunno, i always specify the keysize.

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO 

DEAR FRIEND, 

I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, 
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION. 

I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS 
JOHNSON AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D’IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY 
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN 
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER 
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO 
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER

FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW

HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE

MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO 
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, 
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON 
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY 
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND

CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM THIRTY MILLION 
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$30,000,000,00.)  WITH A 
SECURITY COMPANY IN EUROPE, FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE 
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY
ON OUR BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, 
SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (JOHNSON) WHO 
HAS THE MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID 
FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, 
BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO 
WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL 
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND 
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT 
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH 
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY 
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN 
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL 
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU 
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND 
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION 
FOR YOUR SERVICES. 

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION,THROUGH THIS EMAIL ADDRESS  mrssese1950@netscape.net THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE. 

BEST REGARDS, 

MRS M. SESE SEKO

&gt; This is what I wonder, whether it is portable.

Modifying argv[0][x] in-place (especially making some strings longer than
original) may need non-portable hacks, but argv[0] is just a pointer that
can be portably modified. I have been writing that kind of pointer
manipulating code for at least 16 years without trouble.

&gt; someone explain 1) how to do it and 2) Is there a way to make a
&gt; backup key so that If I burn the Encrypted DVD on one computer I can 
&gt; somehow move the Key to another computer later on and still access 
&gt; the encrypted content later if I want? Thank you

The one way I did it is as follows:

1. Create a file to hold your filesystem
2. losetup it as a loopback device using encryption, I used loop-AES
3. create a filesystem and put the data on that filesystem
4. losetup -d to disconnect the loop and burn this file as an iso image
	growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=filesystem-file

This way you have it and all you have to do is:
losetup /dev/loopX /dev/dvd ....
with the rest of the crypto options you used to create it. Then just
mount loopX and you are all set.

Attention PS2Ownz.com members. 
 
If you are like most visitors to Ps2Ownz.com, then you know that there are many \
different ways to play your favorite import and personally backed up games on your \
playstation 2 console - WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A MODCHIP.  One of the most exciting \
ways to be able to play your Import or backups of your personal games is to be able \
to use the Slide Card, which is a plastic tool, that enables you to SWAP your discs \
in the Playstation 2.    
 
As a very special offer and promotion to members of Ps2Ownz.com we would like to \
invite you to take advantage of a very special $5.00 off promotion on a select \
product, available at Ps2Cover.com     
Together with Ps2Ownz.com we have reduced the price of our Slide Card and Swap Magic \
2.0 combo set to only $29.75 for Ps2Ownz.com members only.  While regular visitors to \
the web site are required to pay $34.75 for this amazing Slide Card and Swap Magic \
2.0 Set, as a special reward to PS2ownz.com members, we invite you to enjoy a $5.00 \
savings on this special set.   
For those of you wondering just what the heck the Swap Magic 2.0 and Slide Card set \
is, read on below.   
The slide card is a no-modchip solution that allows you to play your legally backed \
up games with this no solder solution. Consists of two discs (one for DVDr and one \
for CDr) and a slide card. Works with all versions of PS2. Will also work with PS1 \
game backups (GameShark required).  It does not require any internal soldering or \
even opening of your Playstation 2, wherein you would void the warranty on your \
console.  ** Now confirmed to even work on the V9 playstation 2 consoles **  So if \
you are not sure which chip to get (and unfortunately - most modchips for the V9 are \
buggy) you can feel safe in ordering the Slide Card and having a no modchip, NO \
HASSLE solution for playing all of your favorite games.   
For more information on this product and to take advantage of this limited time \
special from Ps2Cover.com and PS2Ownz.com - don't delay, visit the web site below for \
the special $5.00 off savings.  But hurry, this special price is available only for a \
limited time, and once we have sold the current batch of Slide Card and Swap Magic \
2.0, we will have no choice but to raise the price back up to the regular price of \
$34.75   
 
http://www.ps2cover.com/ps2ownzspecial.html 
 
PS: Order within the next 24 hours, and we'll automatically enter you to win a brand \
new set of Playstation 2 Wireless controllers.  Only the first 300 customers will be \
                entered into this special contest, to give everyone a good chance to \
                win.

under private enquiry. I am Simon Kukes,The Chief Executive Officer of Yukos oil \
company ,the successor of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently facing charges of \
fraud and tax evasion in Russia.I have chosen you for this transaction from \
recommendation from a friend.I need someone who will help us receive the sum of ONE \
HUNDRED  MILLION DOLLARS{US$100,000,000], which is funds from oil  transaction we had \
abroad.The current unfavourable business climate in Russia for Yukos Company has made \
it totally unwise for this money to be paid into our company's account. The Putin's \
administration has decided on a clamp down on our company andthishas placed our \
account under security survillance,Following the raid of the Russian armed police \
(Krelim)in our office and documents,it is now unsafe for any monatry transaction to \
be done in our name and that is why am contacting you,since you dont have any \
business or personal relationship with Mikhail or Yukos,it will be impossible for the \
transaction to be traced to you.We have agreed that after the sucessful transfer of \
the fund into your account,you shall be entitlled to a 20% of the total sum \
transfered. This fund will be in your account for safekeep until modalities for us to \
claim the fund .All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk \
situation on the sides of both parties. Please note that this transaction is strictly \
confidential and must not be disclosed to a third party,this is necssary to avoid \
disclossure that might jeopardise the transaction. Finally, if it is acceptble to \
you, or have questions, feel free to contact me immediatelly through this Email  \
address;(simon_kukes@maktoob.com) You should also send to me your private e-mail \
address and telephone number for easy and confidential communication Hope to hear \

Hey,

Just wanted to try the mm-series instead of vanilla 2.6.x, and ran into a

Oh,

and this Mailing list has gone quite quiet latly...is loopAES not the best 
sollution for completly encrypted disks (including / and *swap*) anymore ? 
Ive seen the crypto-api that is in 2.6, how does it compare to loop-AES ?
Are there any other ways (that I dont know of) ?

Encswap is a package with scripts and instructions 
on how to create encrypted swap and /tmp. It's not automated as the script 
previously posted to the list, instead it uses a configuration file.

Encswap also have the option to encrypt to two seperate loop-devices that is used for
swap so you're able to trash and rebuild the second swap while the
machine is running.

Confirmed to work with patch-int-2.4.20.0 + loop-hvr-2.4.18.0 and 
patch-int-2.4.21.0 + loop-jari-2.4.21.0.patch.
Some testing has been done with 2.6.0-test{7,8,9}.    
Tested on Debian unstable.

Comments are welcomed.

Email:kunde@zwallet.com 

Dear Sir,
I am interested in your partnership in business dealing. This business 
proposal I wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and it's success 
is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of 
confidentiality as regard this transaction. I am representing the board of 
the contract award and monitoring committe of the Zambian Ministry of Mining =

and Resources. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of =

US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars) into your private/company account. The fund came about as a result 
of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The 
contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune 
of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). =

But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian 
contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine 
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown 
to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and 
inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my 
Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment 
approval. As a civil servant still in active government service, I am 
forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence 
this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your 
private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims 
alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the 
difference of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United =

States Dollars) into your provided account. On actualisation, the fund will 
be disbursed as stated below.  20% of the fund will be for you as 
beneficiary 80% of the fund will be for Us. All logistics are in place 
and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction 
within the next few working days of commencement. For further details as to 
the work ability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible 
for further clarification. Please, call me on receipt of this mail on 
0031-627-105-921.or you can also reach me with this email address below: 
kunde@zwallet.com 

Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response. 
Yours Sincerely, 
Mr.Lawrence Kunde

Hello!

If you need to convert your crypto-fs from cipher to another (for example
from serpent to aes), you can use this:

1) setup loop0 (your current crypto-fs)
2) setup loop1 using the same device as loop0, but using the new cipher
3) don't mount loop0 or loop1
4) dd if=/dev/loop0 of=/dev/loop1
5) detach the loops
6) setup loop0 using the new cipher
7) done

Worked at least in couple of machines. 
Use at your own risk! Remember the backups!

the only thing you need with 2.4.22 is 
patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.x or patch-cryptoloop-hvr-2.4.22.x
from

Folks,

I'm trying to get cyptoloop working on a newly-upgraded 2.4.22 machine
that has RH9 installed. When I setup the cryptoloop FS, I had used
util-linux version 2.11y via RPMs, which came with a whole series
of patches from Redhat. Now, I need to use util-linux v2.12. 

What is the best (least risky) way of get kernel 2.4.22 working with
cryptoloop filesystem, on a RH9 machine? I know mucking around with
losetup, mount, etc. could get risky, and I'd prefer not to lose
my filesystem...

Thanks,

Ajay

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Added workaround for module naming breakage in recent module-init-tools
  (2.6 kernels).
- loop.c-2.6.patched updated with fixes from 2.6.0-test11
- Added INITIALDELAY setting to build-initrd.sh. This delays /linuxrc mounts
  to be more compatible with slowly initializing devices. Code from Andreas
  Voegele.
- Added support for struct loop_info64 (2.4 kernels).
- Added support for removing offset from IV computations (2.4 and 2.6
  kernels).
- Added -r option to losetup for read-only mode.
- 64 bit loop device/file offset can now be used on 2.4 and later kernels.
- Added 64 bit "-s nnn" option to losetup and "-o sizelimit=nnn" option to
  mount to limit size of loop device. This option works only on 2.4 and
  later kernels.
- Added support for MD5 IV computation and multi-key operation that reduce
  chances of identical ciphertexts and triggers change to all cipher blocks
  in 512 byte CBC chain if any bit is changed in the 512 byte CBC chain. MD5
  IV is only used in multi-key mode, read losetup -K man page for more
  details.
- Unhashed encryption type, created using ancient loop-AES-v1.0c, now needs
  'mount -o phash=unhashed1' or 'losetup -H unhashed1'.
- Added support for separate object dir on 2.6.x kernels.
- Eliminated highmem io buffer bouncing (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
- Added proper error handling to kernel_thread() error cases (2.4 and 2.6
  kernels).

Additional ciphers package changes since previous release:
- Added workaround for module naming breakage in recent module-init-tools
  (2.6 kernels).
- Switched default loop_serpent.o byte order to correct little endian
  serpent. Old incorrect big endian serpent disk images can be used with
  "losetup -I 2" or "mount -o loinit=2" options.
- Added support for MD5 IV computation and multi-key operation to
  loop_serpent.o and loop_twofish.o modules. They reduce chances of
  identical ciphertexts and trigger change to all cipher blocks in 512 byte
  CBC chain if any bit is changed in the 512 byte CBC chain. MD5 IV is only
  used in multi-key mode, read losetup -K man page for more details.
- Little endian blowfish tests are now disabled by default.
- Added support for separate object dir on 2.6.x kernels.

Listed here are the 3 seminars that Robert Seviour will be presenting in
various locations around the world between now and March 2004. For further
info please send us your details and we will send our brochure pack by
return.


Selling for Engineers
One-day Seminar

The Selling for Engineers seminar is a good introduction to effective sales
principles for people who are new to selling, and also a useful refresher
for 'old hands'.  It applies to selling both technical products and
intangible services.

Many Sales Engineers have been learning the technical skills of their job
for years but have had little formal training in selling.  This course
helps correct that imbalance.  
Typical job titles of delegates: Sales Engineer, Account Executive and
Business Development Manager.

Fee for this event is £300.



Telephone Sales Prospecting for Engineers
One-day Workshop
This event is a practical workshop teaching people in technical companies
how to find new customers on the phone.  It is applicable to business
development for both tangible products and intangible services.  The first
session addresses whom to target, what to say and how to handle problems. 
The remainder of the day consists of live sales calls with coaching from
Robert Seviour; the objective being to give delegates some positive
experiences of prospecting, make sales appointments and maybe sell
something!

Please note that this telephone sales prospecting event is restricted to a
maximum of six delegates to permit individual coaching.
Fee for this event is £300.




Closing Techniques Workshop
One day workshop
What if the customer says:
"	"          'It's too expensive'
"	"          'We're happy with our present supplier'
"	"          'I want to think about it'
 
Can you handle these common objections?
By far the most efficient way to be more profitable is to turn more of the
enquiries you receive into paid orders.  For this, the ability to resolve
objections is critical - either you close or you lose the sale.
And if you answer 'How much discount will you give me?' with: 'I'll ask my
boss', you waste profit, which could be yours with a better reply.
 
In only a day I will teach you techniques which overcome these objections
and more. You will be able to use them immediately to win profitable orders.
 
There is no need to lose business to your competitors or give big
discounts. 
 
Fee for this event is £300. 
 
 
If you have never had any formal sales training or need a refresher, don't
continue to work at a disadvantage. 
 

Reservations and information
Please contact Sue on: 

Tel:  +44(0)1481 720 294     Fax: +44(0)1481 720 317

If sales training is not an issue for your company please reply to this
email with the word "DELETE" in the subject line.     We will remove your
details promptly.

Hi,

I am trying to encrypt individual sessions on a CD-ROM using aespipe with 
the
intention of being able to recover them using the kernel's loop device.

The algorithm I would like to use is something like:

1. Get the old session parameters

	cdrecord -msinfo dev=0,0,0

2. Create a new session and encrypt it on the fly

	mkisofs -C params -M /dev/cdrw -o -r /backupdir | aespipe &gt; crypt.iso

3. Burn the encrypted image:

	cdrecrod -multi -pad dev=0,0,0 crypt.iso


This much seems to work ok (in that the actual command succeeds). To recover
the data, I would like to do something like:

	mount -o encryption=aes,loop=/dev/loop0,session=C /dev/cdrw /mnt/data

However, this doesn't work: mount doesn't believe that the filessytem is
iso9660. I suspect that there is a fundamental flaw in the method I am 
trying
to use; can anyone comment if this is so, or have I missed something simple?

Many thanks for any comments or advice,

Jim Sweet

It may not be considered a job of loop-aes, but it was be a nice feature to 
allow the option of running the data through gzip before encrypting it.  I 
looked at cloop, but you need enough swap to hold the entire partition, i 
guess it does one big zip rather than nice little 512 blocks.

Are 512 blocks too small to compress? would the dictionary take up too much 
room?  Perhaps a larger system wide dictionary could be maintained somwhere, 
i dunno, thats why i'm asking :)

Brad.

Hello,
is it posible to put key out of data file? I want to have key on my usb

I've been having great success using loop-aes with my 2.4 and 2.6 test
series kernel but have recently run into problems with 2.6.0-test6 and
higher.  I've tried this with 4 different kernel versions above
2.6.0-test5-mm4 and the results are the nearly the same.  When I build
loop-aes it compiles fine but when I actually try to mount I get the
following:

	The mount fails and I can't even remove the loop module because it's
still in use somewhere.  I'm using the mm series on an x86 gentoo box. 
I've recently "upgraded" to gcc 3.3.1-r5 and glibc 2.3.2-r6 and these
haven't helped any.  I'm using loop-aes 1.7e with the 20030922 update
patch but I'm still getting the same errors.  Just about all of my
software is bleeding edge so this could certainly be part of the problem
but I can still build a working cryptoloop module for 2.6.0-test5-mm4
(my last known working kernel for cryptoloop).  If there are any
unreleased patched out or anything I can do to help test this I would be
happy to contribute.
	Thank you,
	Dan Elder

Hi,

The loop-AES README says that

	Device backed loop device can be used with journaling
	file systems as device backed loops guarantee that writes
	reach disk platters in order required by journaling file
	system (write caching must be disabled on the disk drive,
	of course). With file backed loop devices, correct write
	ordering may extend only to page cache (which resides in
	RAM) of underlying file system. VM can write such pages
	to disk in any order it wishes, and thus break write order
	expectation of journaling file system.

Could someone explain why caching is even an issue?

I'm familiar with the Solaris kernel but not the Linux kernel, but
by analogy I would imagine that the VM's page cache is completely
transparent to any layer above it. Thus a read following a given combination 
of writes will always return the same data regardless of whether the device 
is backed by a page-layer or not. The same must
surely be true of a write-caching disk drive. It is true that at a
given point in time, there will be no one single location (e.g.
disk platters, disk cache or VM page layer) containing a
contiguous representation of the data. However, I would have thought
that this would be an issue only if there was a sudden power failure.

Any thoughts would be gratefully received.

Regards,

Jim

Hello

I have install the cryptoapi-0.1.0 in the 2.4.21 kernel everything work fine 
, but

I have read that I should not use the ecb mode because it is very weak.

when I load the module this came :

Sep  2 21:05:39 linux kernel: cryptoapi: Registered aes-ecb (0)
Sep  2 21:05:39 linux kernel: cryptoapi: Registered aes-cbc (65536)
Sep  2 21:05:39 linux kernel: cryptoapi: Registered aes-cfb (131072)
Sep  2 21:05:39 linux kernel: cryptoapi: Registered aes-ctr (262144)
Sep  2 21:05:39 linux kernel: cryptoapi: Registered aes-rtc (524288)

BUT:

HOW I KNOW WHICH OF THE MODES (cbc ecb ...) WILL BE USED FROM CRYPTOAPI WHEN 
I MAKE A :

losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 crypt-file

thanks
Markus

&gt; Could someone explain why caching is even an issue?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm familiar with the Solaris kernel but not the Linux kernel, but
&gt; by analogy I would imagine that the VM's page cache is completely
&gt; transparent to any layer above it. Thus a read following a given combination
&gt; of writes will always return the same data regardless of whether the device
&gt; is backed by a page-layer or not. The same must
&gt; surely be true of a write-caching disk drive. It is true that at a
&gt; given point in time, there will be no one single location (e.g.
&gt; disk platters, disk cache or VM page layer) containing a
&gt; contiguous representation of the data. However, I would have thought
&gt; that this would be an issue only if there was a sudden power failure.

Journaling file systems are supposed to do the right thing even in cases
where mains power is temporarily lost. Journaling file systems need to make
sure that writes reach disk platters in known order. Example: if some
"transaction completed" journal write reached disk platters *before* the
actual transaction writes hit disk platters, and mains power was lost, that
transaction would not be re-played because file system code found
"transaction completed" on the journal.

I've been having great success using loop-aes with my 2.4 and 2.6 test
series kernel but have recently run into problems with 2.6.0-test6 and
higher.  I've tried this with 4 different kernel versions above
2.6.0-test5-mm4 and the results are the nearly the same.  When I build
loop-aes it compiles fine but when I actually try to mount I get the
following:

	The mount fails and I can't even remove the loop module because it's
still in use somewhere.  I'm using the mm series on an x86 gentoo box. 
I've recently "upgraded" to gcc 3.3.1-r5 and glibc 2.3.2-r6 and these
haven't helped any.  I'm using loop-aes 1.7e with the 20030922 update
patch but I'm still getting the same errors.  Just about all of my
software is bleeding edge so this could certainly be part of the problem
but I can still build a working cryptoloop module for 2.6.0-test5-mm4
(my last known working kernel for cryptoloop).  If there are any
unreleased patched out or anything I can do to help test this I would be
happy to contribute.
	Thank you,
	Dan Elder

Recent -mm kernels include VFS updates from Al Viro, and they are completely
incompatible with interface in Linus' kernels. Last time I checked,
loop-AES-v1.7e + 20030922 update didn't compile cleanly on recent -mm
kernels. There were some scary warnings.

As of this writing it is unclear if those VFS updates will make to Linus'
tree any time soon. Loop-AES' 2.6 kernel interface follow Linus' kernel
interface, and currently do not work with -mm kernels. 2.6.0-test8 is out,
but I still haven't tested that. Will do that later today.

When/if Al Viro's VFS changes get merged to Linus' tree, loop-AES' 2.6
kernel interface will be updated to that new interface. Until then, loop-AES
only works with Linus' 2.6 kernels.

It may not be considered a job of loop-aes, but it was be a nice feature to 
allow the option of running the data through gzip before encrypting it.  I 
looked at cloop, but you need enough swap to hold the entire partition, i 
guess it does one big zip rather than nice little 512 blocks.

Are 512 blocks too small to compress? would the dictionary take up too much 
room?  Perhaps a larger system wide dictionary could be maintained somwhere, 
i dunno, thats why i'm asking :)

Brad.

&gt; However, this doesn't work: mount doesn't believe that the filessytem is
&gt; iso9660. I suspect that there is a fundamental flaw in the method I am 
&gt; trying
&gt; to use; can anyone comment if this is so, or have I missed something simple?

It looks to me that you've encrypted the entire output of mkiso, which would
also include sector 0 and such. So the mount can't do anything with the
underlying device I guess. Perhaps someone else has done a direct 
encryption on the device.

Have you tried adding "-t iso9660"? I doubt that is enough but it
is the next thing I'd try. Also, why specifiy the specific loop device?
mount will just select the next available one.

I've done this by building a loopback filesystem first and then putting it
as a file on a plain ISO9660 fs.

Hi,

Many thanks (to you and Dale Amon) for your responses --- I apologise
for the delay in replying.

Whilst I am able to encrypt a single session using aespipe in the
manner you describe, I remain unable to encrypt individual sessions.
Trying to mount them invariably results in the error.

	mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock

Does anyone know if there is any reason why one should not be able to
encrypt /individual sessions/ on a CDROM? I am using the
international crypto, with the cryptoloop and cipher-aes modules.

Regards,

Jim

I suspect it may be something to do with the back-references to previous 
sessions created by "mkisofs -C ... -M ..." which would refer to blocks 
outside the scope of the loop device.

As for how to fix it, I have no idea; as far as I can see, it would require 
some kind of special multisession-CD-ROM-aware loop device :-(

I suspect it may be something to do with the back-references to previous 
sessions created by "mkisofs -C ... -M ..." which would refer to blocks 
outside the scope of the loop device.

As for how to fix it, I have no idea; as far as I can see, it would require 
some kind of special multisession-CD-ROM-aware loop device :-(

Can you try this EXPERIMENTAL patch which is for loop-AES-v1.7e ?
I don't have any multisession CD-ROMs to test with, so I have to rely on
your testing efforts. Latest released loop-AES version is here:

Good Day,



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will
be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a
person of integrity.

My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,
I decided to contact you through email, after searching
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.

Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This
money was deposited with this Private Security company for
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the
security company from their office in Netherlands,
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
($580,000,00) for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an
account,
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want
you
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you
in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my
direct line which is +31-630-854-650 or via email,
wolny_olkusz@rediffmail.com


Sincerely,

Wolny Olkusz.

Good Day,



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will
be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a
person of integrity.

My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,
I decided to contact you through email, after searching
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.

Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This
money was deposited with this Private Security company for
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the
security company from their office in Netherlands,
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
($580,000,00) for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an
account,
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want
you
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you
in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my
direct line which is +31-630-854-650 or via email,
wolny_olkusz@rediffmail.com


Sincerely,

Wolny Olkusz.

Well,

im following the loopAES readme, trying to build the loop.o modules for my
2.6.0-test7 kernel (this is my first try to upgrade to the 2.6.x series,
loopAES worked fine so far with the 2.4.x kernels). After doing "make clean"
and then "make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux" I get the following:

From: Mrs Serena Jones
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr.Harry Jones who =
worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine yearsbefore he died in the =
year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a =
brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =
born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a =
child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my
late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Millionsix =
hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in =
Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. =
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  =
stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to =
church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money =
the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will
use this fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of =
God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to =
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this =
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my =
husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don'twant a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death =
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of =
the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall =
hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives =
around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. 
With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receiveyour reply I shall =
give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I =
will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the =
original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray =
for me because the lord is my shephard. My 
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to =
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful =
all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing =
for a chuch or christian individual for this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated =
herein.  Hoping to hearing from you. N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE =
LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY =
BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR =
SUCCESS IN JESUS

Hi,

i run a coule of tests with different crypto ciphers on 2.6.0-test6 
(i386). machine is a AMD TB 900Mhz, 512MB RAM, X is running, but no 
further load. more info soon on the website, but here the results:

&gt;
&gt; yes, i did so, results on:
&gt; http://www.nerdbynature.de/bench/prinz/

Looks promising. But it's not going to be merged because of objections by
the cryptoapi maintainer.

&gt; &gt;http://clemens.endorphin.org/twofish-i586/ (experimential) 
&gt; 
&gt; uh, i guess this masm/windoze/elf32 stuff is too much for me, i could 
&gt; try, but don't have time to dig into this. but you could try my script, 
&gt; and run benchmarks on your machine too.
&gt; but: how is this twofish optimization supposed to go into mainline 
&gt; anyway? one had to use a special compiling environment to compile a kernel?

It's not a patch, it's an add-on. I'm working on a gas version of the
assembler code so it can be merged, but it's far from being complete
(although it works).

&gt; i set up these benchmarks for me too, because i needed to know what 
&gt; cipher is fast enough for my own use. usually i sticked to serpent, now 
&gt; aes-i586 looks quite good on this PC. i wonder if it will compile and so 
&gt; something on ppc32 too, but probably not. which is a pity, because my 
&gt; primary use of the cryptoloop is a ppc :-(

Well that's the cost of an assembler implementation ;) it's not portable. 
Probably you can one of IBM's compilers to compile the cipher of your
choice. http://www-3.ibm.com/software/awdtools/ccompilers/ ... Rumours say
they're fast than gcc.

&gt; yes, i did so, results on:
&gt; http://www.nerdbynature.de/bench/prinz/

Looks promising. But it's not going to be merged because of objections by
the cryptoapi maintainer.

&gt; &gt;http://clemens.endorphin.org/twofish-i586/ (experimential) 
&gt; 
&gt; uh, i guess this masm/windoze/elf32 stuff is too much for me, i could 
&gt; try, but don't have time to dig into this. but you could try my script, 
&gt; and run benchmarks on your machine too.
&gt; but: how is this twofish optimization supposed to go into mainline 
&gt; anyway? one had to use a special compiling environment to compile a kernel?

It's not a patch, it's an add-on. I'm working on a gas version of the
assembler code so it can be merged, but it's far from being complete
(although it works).

&gt; i set up these benchmarks for me too, because i needed to know what 
&gt; cipher is fast enough for my own use. usually i sticked to serpent, now 
&gt; aes-i586 looks quite good on this PC. i wonder if it will compile and so 
&gt; something on ppc32 too, but probably not. which is a pity, because my 
&gt; primary use of the cryptoloop is a ppc :-(

Well that's the cost of an assembler implementation ;) it's not portable. 
Probably you can one of IBM's compilers to compile the cipher of your
choice. http://www-3.ibm.com/software/awdtools/ccompilers/ ... Rumours say
they're fast than gcc.

  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
       I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry =

died in the year
2000.
    We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief =
illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his =

which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the =
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one =
finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is =

churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  =
that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that =
Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don=92t have any child that will  inherit this =
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don=92t want my =
husband=92s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don=92t want a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the =
reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know =
where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. =
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my =

my health because of the presence of my husband=92s relatives around me =

Attn.
I feel compelled to write and request your assistance.
Please, kindly excuse my intrusion into your private
business. I got your contact through a Business
Directory in my effort to get a foreign partner whom
I can entrust with my family investment,while i was
in the recreational centre at the refugee camp in
the Netherlands.
My name is Johnson Kunde Jnr. the eldest son of Hon.
Kunde Makinde Johnson,former minister of finance in
Liberia. The junta Chales Taylor assassinated my father
when he dethrone President,  Samuel Doe, which
subsequently led to outbreak of war in my country.
The perennial war in the country forced me and my
Family into exile in various countries. After the
Death of my father, we discovered among my father?s
Documents that he deposited some funds totaling Twenty
-fivemillion Five hundred Thousand United State Dollars
(US$25. 500.000.00) with a private security company in
Netherlands. I am now under political asylum in the
Netherlands while my mother and my siblings are in
Hideout in Dakar Senegal.
My mother advised me to search for a reliable business
oriented person who can help us invest these funds. We
have proposed 20% to you for your assistance while 5%
is set aside for any possible contigencies. Modality
has been work out to the highest level to move these
Funds out of Africa as soon as you signify your
interest to help us invest the balance 75% into a
viable business in your country.
The assistance we are soliciting from you is to help
us receive and invest the money why my family will
join you in your Country as soon as we achieved our
desired goal. I will appreciate it if you could write
me to enable us discuss further on the whole issue
raised herein. These burdens appeared enormous for me
due to my ignorance in the business industry and
coupled with my present social status.
Sir, I am eagerly anticipating your swift response.

usually you want to compress 128k and 64k size blocks, cloop and gcloop 
have tools that let you do that by compressing each block, the problem 
is that you have to write the index of the blocks on the TOP of the file.
Refer to the cloop-0.68. for the tools
and gcloop for a cryptoloop alike implementation

It is with great hope despite my unforeseen
predicament that I am writing this great letter to
you from East London in the Eastern Cape of South
Africa.

I am Ms cynthia Bobo-Taylor the niece of newly ousted
President of Liberia, presently seeking asylum in a
neighboring West African country. We are originally
from the Trinidad and Tobago before the father of Liberia enroute 
Spain.

I am a divorce with one son named Cletus Bobo Jnr. I have been living a
lowly life with my son until 3 years ago when President Charles Taylor 
came visiting Trinidad and Tobago. He took me and my son along with him to 
Liberia where he granted us Liberian citizenship.

Since then I have been assisting him in his Diamond deals with buyers 
who came visiting Liberia for bulk purchases. Charles Taylor uses the 
revenue from the illegal trade in diamonds to finance his fight against the 
rebels within Liberia and border country, Sierra Leone. As a result of high demand of Liberian 
Diamond,many African leaders became his friends and he had many Diamond Deposits 
in almost all of the Apex Banks in Africa in exchange for Hard Currency 
for future investment purposes.

Fortunately for me, he had one of the Diamond Deposit in South Africa 
in my name. And that is why I and my son quickly sought for asylum here 
in South Africa to enable me monitor the release of the Diamond Deposit 
for Hard Currency in United States Dollars.Hence, I am contacting you to 
assist me as the recipient of this fund into your bank account in your country
for oversea investments.

I chose to contact you because of the following reasons: One, as an 
asylum seeker, I am limited by South African law to carry out this 
transaction.

Two,when the Diamond were deposited it was agreed that it will be paid
out in United States Dollars for oversea investment outside South Africa. It is my desire to 
establish a Humanitarian Foundation dedicated toward development of African 
Children.So,we will need to invest this fund into a viable investment that will 
be recommended by you. This will afford us the needed finance to run the 
activities of the intended foundation.

Should you be willing to assist me do not hesitate to contact me or my 
son for further deliberation on how best to execute this transaction. The 
amount involved is very huge and I cannot toil with this opportunity to 
secure the future of my only child
and generation. Please email us ; taylorcynthia77@yahoo.com

Thank you and God bless you.
Yours sincerely,
Ms. cynthia Bobo-Taylor

be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a
person of integrity.

My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,
I decided to contact you through email, after searching
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.

Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This
money was deposited with this Private Security company for
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the
security company from their office in Netherlands,
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
($580,000,00) for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an
account,
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want
you
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you
in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my
direct line which is +31-630-854-650 or via email,
wolny_olkusz@rediffmail.com


Sincerely,

Wolny Olkusz.

From the desk of: DR.DENISON EZE 
Executive Director and Financial Controller (NNPC) 
Lagos Nigeria 
Alternate E-mail:denison100@tiscali.co.uk 

Dear Sir/Madam 

CONFIDENTIAL REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 

I am the financial controller of Nigerian National 
PetroleumCorporation 
(NNPC) and I am a director in the NNPC Lagos. I got 
your Contact 
address from an associate working with the Nigerian 
Export Promotion Council 
and decided to reach you with this business proposal 
in strict 
confidence. PURPOSE: On behalf of myself and my 
colleagues who are ministerial 
official and other officers in charge of offshore 
remittance in this 
corporation, we are seeking your assistance for 
the transfer of Forty Two Million (US$42,000,000.00) 
to your account 
for further private investment. Hence our request for 
your assistance. 

SOURCE OF FUND: 

This amount to be transferred into your account 
accrued from 
over-invoiced contract amount of the construction of 
an Oil Refinery Sub- 
Stations in Nigeria (Northern Region) in 1995 to 
expatriate companies. The 
contract which was originally valued for one Hundred 
and Twenty Seven 
Million United States Dollar (US$127,000,000.00) was 
manipulated to read 
one Hundred and Sixty Nine Million United States 
Dollars 
($169,000,000.00) The extra $42,000,000.00 is what we 
want to transfer to your account. This contract has 
been completely 
executed and the contractors have been paid all their 
contract bills less 
this $42,000,000.00. 


DISBURSEMENT: 

We have resolved that you take 30% of the total amount 
for your 
assistance because it is impossible for us to claim 
the amount here in Nigeria 
without foreign assistance. In addition, 10% has been 
mapped out for any miscellaneous expenses incurred by 
either party 
during this business, and 60% for my colleagues and 
myself. 

SECURITY: 

All modalities to affect the payment and subsequent 
transfer of this 
money have been worked out. This transaction is 100% 
risk free. You are 
required to treat this business with the strictest 
confidence. I wait 
your immediate response I will appreciate it if you 
treat this business 
withstrict confidence it demands. We choose you and 
trusted you for this 
transaction because we believe that good friends 
can be discovered and businesses such as this cannot 
be 
realized without trust. This is why we have decided to 
trust you for 
this transaction. We are looking forward to doing this 
transaction with 
you. You can rest assured because your security had 
been considered 
before you were contacted. 

Best Regards, 

DENISON  EZE

Greetings.


 
My name is Frank Amana the eldest son of Rtd General Jeremaiah Abanda, who was the \
estwhile external affair minister of Liberia,I am contacting you in a benevolent \
spirit; utmost confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution to a money \
transfer of $26M that is presently putting my entire family into great disarray.my \
father was the External Affairs Minister in the Government of the Liberia rebel \
leader .

At the mid term of the rebellion which is still on till date, my father thinking fast \
decided to send my younger brother and I out of Liberia because the fate of our \
country was yet to be decided. My brother and I left Liberia for Nigeria with a total \
sum of US$26M(Twenty-six Million US Dollars), sealed in a diplomatic baggage meant \
for the purchase of arms from Nigeria. On arrival in Nigeria because we are political \
asylum seekers, we were not allowed to operate a bank account. So with the \
instruction of my father, I deposited the money with a security company. Though I did \
not reveal the content of the baggage to the security company nor did I declare the \
actual content to them, because we wanted to be on a safer side. I told them that the \
baggage belongs to my foreign affiliate who is the beneficiary of the item. \
Unfortunately, because of my father's political position and influence he was \
assassinated.

Since then, we have been looking for a reliable and trustworthy person to help us \
transfer this money into a foreign account overseas prior to investment in that \
country or any other conducive country overseas. But it has to be less tax demanding \
country. Luckily I ran into you address and other details and decided to contact you \
and see if you can be of any help to us. We intend to share this money (US$26Million) \
as follows: 

1. 20% of the total sum goes to you if you assist us in transferring this    money \
successfully into any of your overseas account. 

2. 5% if the total sum will be set aside to offset all bills and expenses    incurred \
in the process of this transaction. 

3. 75% of the total sum will be for my brother and I for investment in any    country \
of which you will be a guide to us. Please note that this         transaction is 100% \
risk free on your side, as we have concluded all       modalities to aid this \
transfer. Should this meet your utmost         consideration, please give me your \
earliest reply through MY E-MAIL        ADDRESS. Be kind to provide me with your \
communication facilities for hitch-free and confidential link. Feel free to ask \
questions you consider necessary in this transaction. The confidentiality in this \
transaction cannot be over emphasized as I trust and believe that you will oblige us \
the needed security and attention it demands. Please treat this transaction with \
absolute    onfidentiality. 


Respectfully summited.


Frank Amana

Recent -mm kernels include VFS updates from Al Viro, and they are completely
incompatible with interface in Linus' kernels. Last time I checked,
loop-AES-v1.7e + 20030922 update didn't compile cleanly on recent -mm
kernels. There were some scary warnings.

As of this writing it is unclear if those VFS updates will make to Linus'
tree any time soon. Loop-AES' 2.6 kernel interface follow Linus' kernel
interface, and currently do not work with -mm kernels. 2.6.0-test8 is out,
but I still haven't tested that. Will do that later today.

When/if Al Viro's VFS changes get merged to Linus' tree, loop-AES' 2.6
kernel interface will be updated to that new interface. Until then, loop-AES
only works with Linus' 2.6 kernels.

&gt; Could someone explain why caching is even an issue?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm familiar with the Solaris kernel but not the Linux kernel, but
&gt; by analogy I would imagine that the VM's page cache is completely
&gt; transparent to any layer above it. Thus a read following a given combination
&gt; of writes will always return the same data regardless of whether the device
&gt; is backed by a page-layer or not. The same must
&gt; surely be true of a write-caching disk drive. It is true that at a
&gt; given point in time, there will be no one single location (e.g.
&gt; disk platters, disk cache or VM page layer) containing a
&gt; contiguous representation of the data. However, I would have thought
&gt; that this would be an issue only if there was a sudden power failure.

Journaling file systems are supposed to do the right thing even in cases
where mains power is temporarily lost. Journaling file systems need to make
sure that writes reach disk platters in known order. Example: if some
"transaction completed" journal write reached disk platters *before* the
actual transaction writes hit disk platters, and mains power was lost, that
transaction would not be re-played because file system code found
"transaction completed" on the journal.

Dear friend,
 Compliment of the day, I am JAMES KYARI, The son of late General  Kubwa =
Kyari of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) =
with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila, he =
was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally =
in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which =
already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.
 Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he =
received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila =
which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of =
US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the =
Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious  stones =
while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the =
Congolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president, =
but on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  =
father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  =
of our
numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was =
able to reveal this secret to me and advice that i should proceed to  the =
Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that=

will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made =
my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  =
clearthis money is with a finance security company in Holland.
 On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political =
asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort  on the =
best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised
that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest =
this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because =
our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we =
seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.
 I got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in =
Belgium. Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money =
through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the =
totalsum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the =
courseof concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me =
and  my family. Also you stand to gain from any investment you might =
introduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.
 Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your =
account for security reasons.
 This is my e-mail address you can reach  me:(jameskyari22@netscape.net
 Thanks and GOD bless.

Good Day

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope thisletter meets \
you in good time. It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me \
since you do not know me personally.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,which I propose \
with my free mind and as a person of integrity and from a family with high moral \
respect . My name is  Fred Johnson , the first son of Mapele Johnson , of the  most \
popular black farmer   from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my country.

I and my  mother  decided  to contact you  through email, after searching for  \
contacts via the internet,as it  is the only means I can contact anybody since I  am \
cutting off ties with  Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  However,i \
appologise if this is not accepted by you.      

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  a business \
venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe,as a result of President \
Robert Mugabe's introduction of  new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white \
farmers and the   few rich black farmers,and his desire to hold on to power for \
life,.

My father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he \
withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares in \
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum of US$10.million   \
(Ten million, US dollars), in a private Fianacial &amp;  security company. This money was \
deposited with this Private Financial &amp; Security company for safety and security \
reasons, and  was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals \
establishment of new  farms in Togo President Mugabe   support for the violent  \
Zimbabwean war veterans  and some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my \
beloved  father and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon my \
inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a while, but when \
the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking  political asylum. In \
fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is  because the security company from \
South Africa, has a branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office \
in Johannesburg down   here. I need your assistance  in receiving this consignment \
from the security compamy.Since the law of Netherlands  prohibits a refugee (asylum \
seeker) to be involved in such transactions and my  mother advised that  it will be \
better for our foreign partner to help receive this fund to avoid any eye brown being \
raised by Robert Mugabe

This is why  I am  seeking a genuine  and reliable partner,who will assist in \
receiving the funds and also investing  it wisely in a profitable venture.You have to \
understand that  this decision taken by me  entrusts my future and in your hands,as a \
result   of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me,all I want you \
to do  for  me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  \
security company  from their office here in The Netherlands,as it has  now been \
transfered from  Johannesburg,South Africa to their branch in The Netherlands.

The company will be  legally informed  of you representing my family.For your \
assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have 20% of the \
money for your assistance, and helping my family investing this funds, or you can go  \
into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  money in your \
country.

Whichever the option you want, please do  notify me in your reply.I have also set \
aside 5% of this money for all kinds of  expenses that  come our way in the process \
of this transaction, and 1%  of the total sum for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 20% for assisting in representing my family to receive \
this funds, then 80%will  be left for my family. Please, I want you to maintain the \
absolute secrecy for the purpose  of this transaction.

I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in advance as I \
anticipate your co-operation.

Reply me with my private email address fredjohnson0@netscape.net

Sincerely,

Fred Johnson.

Hi,

 I've been using kerneli.org's patch-int for a year now, and everything
has been running perfectly until now. I have several kerneli.org
encrypted volumes, which stopped working with 2.4.22's new cryptoapi
stuff. I've been reading the threads on this issue, and unfortunately
I'm unable to mount old volumes with a 2.4.22 kernel. 

 Below are the descriptions of my attempts. I don't expect a HOWTO to
make it work, just a couple of your brain-time to help on finding the
problem. 
 BTW, to make sure I don't have a patch-int legacy problem, I've created
a brand new crypto-fs using 2.4.21 and the corresponding patch-int,
which I'm using in these tests. 


strike 1:
---------
linux-2.4.22
patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22-rc2.0 / 1
 
util-linux-2.12
losetup-keygen-prog-mk7
losetup-variable-key-size-mk6

~scorpio/TESTE

mount -o loop /dev/loop0 ~scorpio/teste
VFS: Can't find a valid FAT filesystem on dev ...


strike 2:
---------

linux-2.4.22
loop-AES-v1.7e
 
util-linux-2.12
losetup-keygen-prog-mk7
losetup-variable-key-size-mk6

losetup -p0 -e aes-cbc-256 /dev/loop0 ~scorpio/TESTE
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument


 Thanks in advance.

Best of regards,
 Ricardo Oliveira.

&gt; OK. I missed this. I didn't patch util-linux 2.12 at all.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll try again.

With patched util-linux 2.12 (and hashalot) I'm now able to succesfully mount

FROM MRS BECKY COLEMAN
OF SIERRA LEONE
PS:REPLY TO MY
PRIVATE EMAIL :becky23q@netscape.net
 


Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Becky Coleman wife to the late Chife Paul Coleman from 
Sierra Leone. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek 
your assistance to transfer our cash of thirty  Million Dollars 
($30,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private Security trust firm here
in Europe 
the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as Precious stones by my
late Husband,as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as
money, although my husband made them to under stand that the boxes belongs
to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:

My late Husband Chief Paul Coleman , a native of  Mende District in 
the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra 
Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my 
Husband, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over
draft and minor sales. 

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major 
Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that 
almost destroyed my country, following the forcefull removal from power 
of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My 
Husband had already made arrangement for  I and my two children to be 
evacuated to a refugee camp in South Africa with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT
he made
with a security firm in Europe through the aid of U.N evacuation team. 

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting 
of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone
mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My 
husband including other top Government functionaries were attacked and 
killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the 
civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my husbands's death , and with the information we got 
that the rebels are out for us the burden became too much for me to 
handle coupled with the ill health of my dauther she died in the process as 
i could not afford her a decent medical care.

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm
To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.

1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security
  Firm as our beneficiary

2. to transfer this money (USD$30M) in your name to your country

3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our 
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager

Hello

I'd like to do incremental encrypted remote backups. I thought this 
might be a solution: use nbd (network block device, from standard 
kernel) to access the backup partition or file on the server.

  nbd-client $host $port /dev/nbd/0
  losetup -e blowfish /dev/loop0 /dev/nbd/0

  # optional: ext3 journal device:
  backupjournal=/root/backup.journal
  dd bs=4096 count=8192 &lt; /dev/zero &gt; $backupjournal
  losetup $backupjournal /dev/loop1
  mke2fs -O journal_dev /dev/loop1

  mke2fs -j -J device=/dev/loop1 /dev/loop0

  mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/loop0
  mkdir /mnt/loop0/{data,trash}

  rsync -aHxv --delete --exclude=$backupjournal \
   --backup-dir=/mnt/loop0/trash/ / /mnt/loop0/data/


These are the problems and issues I'm asking here:

1. My client os (linux 2.4.22 + ben1 (Ben Herrenschmidt's powerpc 
patch) + freeswan) freezes completely every now and then. At first, I 
thought it was because I used an NBD partition of 8GB (e.g. large 
file), it froze right in the middle of the mke3fs. I then upgraded 
nbd-server+-client to the current Debian unstable versions and 
retried with 1.5GB, which worked well, until I copied a few 100MB of 
data onto the filesystem, then froze again.
   Is cryptoloop not yet stable? Is NBD to blame? Is it the 
combination of both? Is it the journaling to blame? Is it that I'm 
tunneling the nbd data stream through an ssh tunnel (see below)?

2. I realize that cryptoloop does not use checksums/signatures at 
all. Of course that means that an attacker can easily destroy my 
backup volume while in transit or while stored on the (broken in) 
backup server in subtle ways, so that I won't notice it except that 
some random files are broken etc., and maybe he can even make the 
client os crash (because of bad filesystem structures) or other bad 
stuff. I'd like to have a way to prevent this. Currently I'm 
tunneling the traffic through ssh (how ironic) and simply hoping that 
the image on the server is never modified by third parties.


Are there alternatives? tar|gpg|netcat(+md5) is a solid solution but 
requires full backups each time. Anything else?

Thanks for any answers
Christian.

not necessarily: i'm using dump (via amanda), and my /sbin/dump is a 
90 line shell script that runs dump's output through gpg.

DNS entry www.amanda.org seems to be deleted.

How can amanda or dump find out what has changed without accessing 
the data from the last backup? Does it require a local full backup to 
build the encrypted incrementals? Or does it store hashes of the 
files?

Hi,

I just compiled the 2.4.22 kernel with the patches
patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0 and
patch-aes-asm-2.4.22.0.

When I try to insert the cryptoloop module now, I get
the following error messages:

/lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/drivers/block/cryptoloop.o:
unresolved symbol crypto_alloc_tfm
/lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/drivers/block/cryptoloop.o:

/lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/drivers/block/cryptoloop.o:

What's wrong??

dump records time and backup level (0=full,1=changes since full etc.) 
in a file called "dumpdates" (/var/lib on FHS-compliant systems, 
/etc/dumpdates elsewhere) and goes from there.

&gt;Does it require a local full backup to build the encrypted incrementals? 

no. all you need for incrementals is a time to discern stuff that has
changed and therefore needs to be backed up.

&gt;
&gt;Yes, this would work with tar, too. However, date-based incremental
&gt;backups don't work well
&gt;* for large files with small changes

Yes. Well the nice thing of the nbd/cryptoloop approach would be that 
I don't necessarily need to keep (possibly quite many) old versions, 
I can simply overwrite the old backup file. Or keep one version only 
if I really want to keep them in a "trash", and empty the trash if it 
gets too big etc.; and I can always directly access the state of the 
whole filesystem at the time of the last backup without having to 
restore multiple incremental backups that may be big (i.e. 6GB full 
backup plus multiple possibly multi-GB incremental archives). And I 
can pick out any single file directly without having to unencrypt the 
whole thing too..

&gt;* when you can't trust the time stamp (what happens when files or
&gt;   directories are moved? file hierachies untarred?)

(It should probably not only save the modification time, but also 
size, and (debatable) inode number and inode change time.)

&gt;Some sort of "rsync/unison into an encrypted tar archive" would be
&gt;nice. Any ideas how to achieve this in userland?

There's librsync (and rdiff making use of it).

Christian.

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system
Archive:       http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/


</body></email><email><emailId>20030918010747</emailId><senderName>Ben Slusky</senderName><senderEmail>sluskyb@paranoiacs.org</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-09-18 01:07:47-0400</timestampReceived><subject>[PATCH] new losetup patches, submitted for inclusion</subject><body>

[Attachment #2 (multipart/mixed)]


Updated patches for util-linux-2.12 have been posted to
&lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/&gt;.

losetup and mount will now check cipher names and key sizes against
/proc/crypto, whether that's a file (ie. new CryptoAPI) or a directory
(old CryptoAPI). Thing is that it won't always work under the new
CryptoAPI: some ciphers (including AES and Twofish, possibly others)
require the key size to be a "round number" and may throw an EINVAL at you
even when the key size is between the listed minimum and maximum. Maybe
we ought to revive the keysize_mask from the old CryptoAPI?

I also created a combined patch (attached), which IMO is ready to be
included in util-linux. What do y'all think? (especially Andries)

I've updated my patches with a fix from Tilman Vogel, to correctly back
out of losetup in the event that the crypto parameters are incorrect.
Without this fix the loop device will be halfway set up, requiring a
losetup -d before you can try again.

Okay, I've tested it out from scratch and mounted an old encrypted test file

Do you know about star? I tried to get an extra switch added
to gnutar for it at one point but I don't think it ever
happened. When built with support for it, tar could encrypt
files the same way you bzip2 them.

yes. It's about doing backups from my single most trusted machine, 
too, so I must prevent any sensitive information to leave this 
machine unencrypted completely.

&gt;   That's where the NFS underlying layer to a large file might be a better
&gt;choice than NBD.

It's not any different regarding secure cryptographic hashes than NBD 
- I even think they need *both* a secure transport layer (ssh tunnel 
or ipsec) to give any reliability against modification while in 
transit. And regardless from this, if I can't trust the server, I 
need crypto hashes with the key *I* am using in the encryption part 
of the archive -&gt; which means inside crypto-loop. If crypto-loop does 
encryption but not encrypted checksums, there's basically no way to 
add that in back later. One could create signatures of the whole 
*encrypted* data and encrypt that signature ex post (with the same 
key being used by crypto-loop), *but* if I don't store the encrypted 
data on a trusted host, I can't create a trusted signature there 
either. So the signature must be generated before the data leaves the 
trusted machine - and since data leaves the machine in blocks that 
only crypto-loop and nbd know about, checksumming must be built into 
nbd or crypto-loop. Of course the latter would be the preferred way.

Now, independently of the above security considerations, do you mean 
that accessing a large file through NFS for crypto-loop purposes is 
going to be more stable than accessing it through NBD? Both NFS and 
NBD are in the kernel, and while NBD is *meant* to deliver block 
devices accessible by other kernel code, NFS files are meant to be 
accessed from userspace, so I have some doubt as to whether NFS files 
would be less prone to deadlocks when used for crypto-loop.

Christian.

&gt; 
&gt; However, this appears to be little more than a convenience hack that
&gt; always reduces to piping through an encryption program. This would
&gt; preclude any simple updating of the archive, wouldn't it?

sectar integrates with gnutar. I had it running with the full
power of gnutar and encryption as just another compression option.

I don't know if anyone went anywhere with my patches: it was
a couple years ago when I last looked at it.

As long as you don't attempt to boot off that CD, you can basically use
*any* filesystem (or whatever) to burn it on the platter. You can even
place ext2 on it (I wouldn't recommend to use any journalling
filesystems, because these may need write access to the journal even on
a RO media). In theory, you should even be able to burn a raw loop image
on that thingie...

&gt; I got it working here, I used util-linux-2.11z with an extra patch which
&gt; combines all the util-linux-crypto-patches, but I don't remember the url
&gt; at the moment. I can look later if you can't find it.
&gt;

I thought that the util-linux packet from debian unstable is already prepatched
for usage of crypto stuff, but anyway if you find the url to this patch file i could
test it :)

btw:
Am i right with my tought that i don´t need to apply the crypto-api (international kernel)
patch to 2.4.22 coze for me it seems that the crypto api is already included in the
normal 2.4.22 source ?!
In other words: the only kernel patch needed is the jars cryptloop patch ?

In some other discussion threads i saw ppl asking about the /proc/crypto/chipters content
but on my system /proc/crypto isn´t a directory its a file, if i do a cat on it the result is:

# cat /proc/crypto

&gt;for usage of crypto stuff, but anyway if you find the url to this 
&gt;patch file i could test it :)

the patch is minimal and contained in that bug report, 
and it works (on the machine i'm typing this on at least). 
my version of util-linux is 2.11z-1 plus that one patch, which
affects only the mount package.

there's one ugly side effect of that patch, though: losetup now /always/
asks for a keysize and password, even if you want to mount a bog-standard
iso9660 image with no encryption whatsoever.

&gt;In other words: the only kernel patch needed is the jars cryptloop patch ?

correct. also the cryptoloop-source or cryptoapi-core-source packages 
are no longer necessary.

It was prepatched for the old Crypto API. 2.6 kernels and the
feature backport to 2.4.22 have a different API because crypto
is now part of the linux kernel source. I've tried to get
a message to Adrian Bunk but have no reply so farm so...
 
&gt; not yet, unfortunately. see 
&gt; &lt;URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=206396&gt;

I'm glad to see someone has filed a report.

&gt; there's one ugly side effect of that patch, though: losetup now /always/
&gt; asks for a keysize and password, even if you want to mount a bog-standard
&gt; iso9660 image with no encryption whatsoever.

There is another side-effect. The password taken by
losetup is no longer the plaintext, but is assumed to
be already hashed. If you wish to use an old loopback
file system, you will have to feed your plaintext 
password through "hashalot" and pipe it into losetup.

You might wish to refer to the archives as I posted the
detail of an install and test of this from scratch on
a virgin 2.4.21 patched up to 2.4.22rc2. Procedure is
the same, you just omit the pre22 patch and start from
2.4.22 source base.

ahem, that can't be all the truth: i haven't got hashalot 
but am currently using my old encrypted partition just the same as
before (ie. typing the same passphrase to losetup) without any
problems.

that's an aes-encrypted partition which had been created using
the cryptoapi-core and cryptoloop packages (sometime between 2.4.18 and
2.4.21) and a standard debian losetup.
now i'm using 2.4.22 with jari's cryptoloop patch and the in-kernel cryptoapi.

so, where are our setups different?

&gt; 

I have problems migrating from patch-int+loop-hvr to patch-cryptoloop..

I created the cryptoloop-fs using Linux 2.4.21 with patch-int + loop-hvr and
unpatched losetup from debian 3.0 (woody).

Now, I compiled 2.4.22 with patch-cryptoloop-jari and patch-aes-asm. I'm
still using losetup from debian 3.0 (woody).. 

I couldn't get the fs to work with the new kernel. losetup complained
something about the encryption type or so (Sorry, I don't have the exact
error message available now..)

I'm using aes (keysize 256).

I tried using util-linux 2.12, and encryption type aes-cbc-256 like this:

hashalot ripemd160 | ./losetup -p0 -e aes-cbc-256 /dev/loop0 /dev/vg0/lv0
 
But I couldn't mount the loop0 after this.. so the key was not set up like
in my patch-int+loop-hvr combo..

Any ideas? 

Thanks!

That is to be expected.

Hm... in this case I wouldn't expect it to be. You're using 256-bit
encryption, but the output of RIPEMD-160 is only 160 bits. It is possible
that hashalot sets the remaining bits differently than the old losetup code.

I'll see if I can't fix that, but meantime I strongly recommend that you
re-encrypt with an SHA-256-hashed key (or maybe even SHA-384). Right now
you're really using 160-bit AES.

Looking over the code that I copied into hashalot, the above explanation 
makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Sorry.

Did you apply both patches (variable-key-size and keygen-prog) to 
util-linux? If you didn't apply the keygen-prog patch then losetup may
mutilate your key.

OK. I missed this. I didn't patch util-linux 2.12 at all.

I'll try again.

    URGENT CALL FOR ASSISTANCE.

You might be wondering about the origin of this letter since we never met nor =

both sides.The 1999 coup that brought in general GUEI to power brought a =
great deal of mistrust due to the rebels refusal to demobilize for a peaceful =
transition.
    On January 2003,a peace accord was reached between the warring parties =
that eventually led to the establishment of a government of national =
unity.This was short-lived due to the mass arrest of our members accused of =
trying to overthrow the government of LAURENT GBAGBO.My brother IBRAHIM =
COULIBALY a well known political figure from the north was arrested in france =
on suspicion of trying to recruit mercenaries to stage a coup in ivory =
coast.My younger brother captain FABIEN COULIBALY was also arrested and all =
currently in detention.
    With this development,it became obvious that I the financial treasurer to =
the rebel movement could be the next target.After consulting with mr WAI =
GOGBE,a lawyer representing my brothers and others currently in detention,he =
advised the need for an urgent flee to safety.I have since moved to the =
Netherlands where I have currently been granted a refugee status.
    I as the treasurer of the movement had in my custody the sum of nine =
million two hundred and sixty eight thousand united states =
dollars($9,268,000)realized from our diamond sales and contributions from =

   I would like you to treat this with utmost priority by replying =
immediately via the above email address.You may also add any other vital =

    Your urgent response would be highly appreciated.
Thank you so much for your time and God bless.

Good day,

I know that this letter will come to you as a surprise due to the fact
that we have not yet met each other before, but please be rest assured
that there is no cause for alarm. I have decided to notify you of my
business proposal because of your integrity and goodwill. I got your
contact from a foreign business associate that travels overseas
frequently. I will tell you more of my contact as we proceed further
with the execution of this business.

In bringing this message to you, I have to say that I have no Intention
of causing you any personal pains or discomfort. I am Mr. A.Savimbi, son
of the late rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the
22nd of February 2002. 


Presently, I am desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist
me in this confidential business. My late father, Jonas Savimbi lodged
huge sums of money realized from the sales of diamonds and other
precious stones /metals in different security and finance companies in
Europe. My father is presently is dead, and the movement of his family
members (including me) is highly restricted,all his bank accounts and
properties have been frozen and seized. We are forbidden to either travel
abroad or out of our immediate localities.

Presently, I have just discovered a huge deposit made by my father from
the money realized from the last sales of diamonds before is death
amounting to US$5O,000,000.00 (FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS),
my father had deposited this money as diplomatic consignment
with a security firmS in Europe, I have called the security firm and they
have confirm to me that the consignment is with them. I have all the
documents with me right now that is needed to collect the consignment
from the security firm, my father has instructed the security firm in his
deposit request to release consignment to any three family members
which includes myself, my mother and only sister who is also dead incase
of emergency or death. Right now my family has given me the authority to
do everything possible to get the consignment out as this is the only
hope we have now to bring the family out of its present poor financial
state.

I am therefore soliciting your help to have this consignment collected
by you and the funds transferred into your account. I will give you
all the necessary documentations to facilitate your collection of the
consignment personally in Europe. The government has no or will never
have knowledge of this business, so there is no need to be worried about

your safety. I guarantee you your safety. Once I have your complete
assurance that you can handle this, I will immediately send to you the
relevant documents that will enable you take possession of the
consignments. This will include certificate of deposit and all other
relevant documents. Meanwhile all I need from you now is as follows:

1. Confirmation of your ability to handle this.
2. Your word that you will keep this business as confidential as
possible at all times until we conclude this business.
3. Your Name and address, telephone and fax numbers for 
communication.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I will also send to
you a LETTER OF AUTHORITY and AGREEMENT to enable you clear 
the
consignment on my behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as
the Angola government has no knowledge that such money is still in 
existence.

However, in return for all your assistance and troubles we have decided
to offer you 15% of the total amount of money as your share and 5% for
all your expenses which will include your travel expenses to Amsterdam
and every other expenses you incur in the cause of this transaction,
such as your telephone bills etc, this makes a total of 20% my family has
agreed to give to you for helping us secure the money. 

I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

Regards,
A. Savimbi.

    Christian&gt; Now, independently of the above security considerations, do
    Christian&gt; you mean that accessing a large file through NFS for
    Christian&gt; crypto-loop purposes is going to be more stable than accessing
    Christian&gt; it through NBD? Both NFS and NBD are in the kernel, and while
    Christian&gt; NBD is *meant* to deliver block devices accessible by other
    Christian&gt; kernel code, NFS files are meant to be accessed from
    Christian&gt; userspace, so I have some doubt as to whether NFS files would
    Christian&gt; be less prone to deadlocks when used for crypto-loop.

  I would say yes.

  NBD is designed to provide raw blocks. While the concept is ages old
and predates NFS by 5 years (Sun2's used to network boot with Sun's "ND" 
driver), the NFS code in Linux, while not as solid as other implementations,
has been beat on a lot more than NBD.

  /dev/loop doesn't really care if it lives atop a file or a raw device.

  NFSv3 can live over TCP, and NFSv4 prefers to, but I don't think we have
an NFSv4 implementation yet. NFSv4 supports thinkgs like GSSAPI, but as you
point out, that is for protection of eavesdropping, not to assure file
privacy/integrity.

  I understand what you want - I don't think that it has been done in
cryptoloop. I think that it has to be integrated into the file system,
each each directory entry and inode really needs to be given seperate
cryptographic integrity checks, so that you can recover some of them.

FROM: PRINCE FEMI KOKOMA
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA

Reply  to, kokoma@coolgoose.com  

REQUEST FOR URGENT ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT

Dear Sir, 

My names is PRINCE FEMI KOKOMA, the elder son of Mr. ANTHONY KOKOMA, of Zimbabwe. It \
might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address; I got it from network on \
line, South African. During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the \
supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our \
country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party \
members and their followers. My father was one of the best farmers in the country and \
knowing that he did not support the president's political ideology, the president's \
supporters invaded my father's farm burnt down everything, shot him and as a result \
of the wounds sustained, he became sick and died a! After two days. And after his \
death, I with my younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of \
our lives to South-Africa BUT, before he died HE WROTE HIS WILL, which reads "(MY \
BELOVEED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SUM OF (US$18.5MILLION) MILLION \
U.S DOLLARS, WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG \
(SOUTH-AFRICA). IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY". You should \
solicit for reliable foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of \
South Africa for investment purpose I deposited the money in your name and it can be \
claimed by you alone with the deposit code. Your mother has all the documents. Take \
good care of your mother and brother." From the above, you will understand that the \
lives and future of my family depends on this money as much, I will be very grateful \
if you can assist us. I with my younger bro! There are now living in South-Africa as \
POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS and the financial law of SOUTH-AFRICA does not allow ASYLUM \
SEEKERS certain financial rights to such huge amount of money .In view of this, I \
cannot invest this money in South-Africa. Hence I am asking you to assist me transfer \
this money out of South Africa for investment purposes. For your efforts, I am \
prepared to offer you 20% of the total  fund, while 5% will be set aside for local \
and international expenses and 75% will be kept for me and my family   Finally \
modalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to you once we establish \
trust and confidence between ourselves. Looking forward to your urgent reply .For \
detailed information. NOTE: THE KEY WORD TO THIS TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE \
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY. THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. YOUR URGENT RESPONSE \
WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED.  

BEST REGARDS,
PRINCE FEMI KOKOMA

Email:ekiomor670@netscape.net
  
INTRODUCTION: l am Mrs. Eki Omorodion l know this proposal will come to 
you as a surprise because we have not met before  either Physically or 
through correspondence.
I have no doubt in your ability to handle this proposal involving huge 
sum of money. 
 THE SUBJECT: MY HUSBAND CHIEF JOSEPH OMORODION (Now Late)
was the Royal Head of my Community, JESSE (an oil rich town) in  
Nigeria.
My late husband’S community produces 3.5%  of the total crude oil
production in Nigeria and 0.5%  of the Dollar value of each barrel is 
paid to my husband as royalty by the Federal Government. 
My husband was also the Chairman of  OMPADEC,Jesse branch.
In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the OMPADEC, Jesse 
branch,he made some money which he left for me and our children as
the only thing to inherit. The money is Twelve Million US Dollars($12M). 
Though this said fund accumulated  between the period 1976-1998. 
Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political instability as a 
result of past Military rules (1985-1999), he deposited this Money in a 
 Strong Room/safe with an open beneficiary in Apex Bank of
Nigeria pending when he would finish arrangement to transfer it broad 
as a CONTRACT PAYMENT. 
He  was planning this when he died late last year of Heart Attack.  
THE PROPOSAL: Just before my husband died he called my attention to the 
money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the 
transfer / investment of the funds abroad.
So l would be very grateful if you could accept to help me archieve 
this great objective. 
I promise to give you 20% of the total funds transferred to your vital 
bank account as compensation for your assistance.
Five percent (5%)would be set aside to take care of all expenses we
may incure during the transaction.
To indicate your interest, contact me urgently and confidentially for 
more information and the roles you will play in this business.
All the legal information concerning  this Money will be sent to you 
as soon as we agree together. 
Send your reply through this mail box,  see the note below 

Yours faithfully,
MRS. Eki Omorodion.

N.B
I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names, 
telephone and fax numbers to enable my eldest son David Omorodion to 
contact you.He shall handle this transaction from A-Z on behalf of the 
family.

Does nobody else have this problem or know what's

aes-asm-patch, with all the crypto-kernel-options
selected, etc.), but I always get the same error. I
would really like to use the current and upcoming
kernels, but I need the crypto functions to access my
data.

Any help greatly appreciated.

Good Day,
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you \
in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we \
have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,I humbly ask that you take \
due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your \
confidence, as I make  this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mr.Robert \
Savimbi,I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader \
of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my \
instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for \
a partner, hence  this email. 
My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by \
President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio \
Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, assumed office as \
leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in \
Dembo and general lukamba, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent \
members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to \
enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, \
including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA became \
uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor \
in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this \
struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a \
peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I \
secretly left Angola and came here t Holland) to seek political asylum.
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect \
to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money \
(Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss \
Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on \
transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Netherlands. \
in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed \
the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further \
instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have \
now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I \
came to the netherlands to sought for political asylum here is because of the safe \
deposit.  President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my \
Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in \
Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds \
to the here. I plan to use this money to safeguard my families future. It is very \
essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in \
you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this \
money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. \
Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which \
is deposited in my name from the Security and finance company, after which, the money \
will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this \
transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application \
in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account \
here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the \
Money of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment \
containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the \
release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer \
of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending \
on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in \
enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested \
in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of \
non-interest on your part. To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate \
Angola, click on the link below and read.

I have justed looked through the crypto code in kernel 2.6.0test5 and 
have found that it currently only supports the ECB and CBC modes of 
operation for block ciphers. Support for the CFB and CTR modes seems to 
be planned but is not there yet.

Would it be worth the effort to implement the other modes? Is anybody 
already working on that?

This is a multi-part message in MIME format

Good Day,
with warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I=

am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I
propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.
My name is BENSON JNR, the son of ZHIRI , a farmer
from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by
my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for =
contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact
anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I
apologize if this is not acceptable to you.
The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in
Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new
Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few
rich black farmers, all white farmers were asked to
surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his =
political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the =
farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not =
support the president's idea. 
He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade =
my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They killed my
father and took away a lot of items from his farm. 
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my =
father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we =
should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will documents has a =
certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit totaling Fifteen million =
five hundred thousand united state dollars. [15.5m] Kept in custody for us in =
a security company unknown
to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal =
belongings. This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for =
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new =
machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.
This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
my beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.
I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
after he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
with the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
with his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but =
all to no avail.
I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in Johannesburg =
here, which they have since done.
I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the
money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum
seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial
transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable
partner, whose account this money can be transferred, hence this proposal to =
you.
You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
and brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.
If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
with arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
from Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.
For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an =
account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
your reply.
I have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.
Please, I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
this transaction.
Your reply should be sent to my private email address only 
bensonzhirijn@netscape.net
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.
Sincerely,
bensonzhirijn@netscape.net

Dear Sir,

I received encouraging information about your company, It's products
and service. I am delighted with such a useful information. I am interested
in the partnership investment program with your corporation.

First permit me to introduce myself as ALHAJI BELO DADA. Being the 
chiefexecutive and the Chairman of 8th ALL AFRICAN GAME (COJA) 
that will be held in ABUJA capital territory of Nigeria coming this September. 
I awarded the contract of IMPORTING CARS for the game to GERMANY 
Firm worth several millions of dollars. In the execution of that project the 
GERMANY Firm.I collaborated with the GERMANY Firm on a mutual 
agreement on the proceed of which I have received my share 
of $65.000,000 = (sixty five million dollars).

As the Chairman of the this COJA GAMES, I cannot introduce or circulate
this funds into the NIGERIA BANKING system considering my provisional 
duty and the considering the fact that I earn less than $1,000 USdollars 
monthly coupled with the Bureau of conduct guidelines and regulations for 
Public Civil Servants. The above situation prompted my decision to solicit 
your co-operation to take delivery of this funds into your custody for my 
proposed investment as you will be adequately compensated 
with $15 000,000 US dollars.


I will arrange all necessary procedures in ensuring a smooth process 
for the funds to get to you. I will appreciate you ontact me once you 
receive this mail via my e-mail account indicating your capability and 
willingness to enable me to give you more details of my modus operandi of 
getting this money to you hitch free. This matter requires your urgent 
attention and confidentiality whatever your decision.


Best Regards,

CHEIF UWANILE IKEMBA
CHAIRMAN COJA

&gt; I hope we can get the control of key length back

Maybe you didnt see earlier mail about this.

Look: half a year ago there was nothing in vanilla kernel and
util-linux, and one had to use outside patches. Today there
is some support in vanilla kernel and util-linux, but nobody
stops you from continued use of outside patches.

In case you would prefer kernel and util-linux to improve,
don't say "I want improvements", but say very precisely
what syntax you would prefer and why.
Think first about things mounted from /etc/fstab.
Implementing stuff is trivial, but after things have been
implemented they won't be changed, so it is better to do
things right at once.

It doesn't matter who you are. If you can't recruit, you're&lt;br&gt;
not going to make it in this industry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What if you can just reimburse the start-up cost for someone&lt;br&gt;

others to join you?  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I know of an established company out there that you can&lt;br&gt;
actually still make a profit even you have to reimburse the &lt;br&gt;
start-up cost for your new recruits to join you. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are literally thousands of network marketing companies&lt;br&gt;
out there.  This is the only company that we know of that we&lt;br&gt;
can come out with a system that you can still make money by&lt;br&gt;
reimbursing the start-up cost to new members.  It can be done&lt;br&gt;
because of its unique and generous compensation plan.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is a long term opportunity and we are looking for serious&lt;br&gt;

I wanted to encrypt my whole hard disk and looked for a method to do
so.  I found methods close to this goal but not quite achieving it so I
made my own method and wrote it up.

I've included it in a new "Disk Encryption HOWTO", intended to supersede
the existing "Loopback Encrypted Filesystem HOWTO" [1].  Please read it
and provide me with criticism, suggestions, and other feedback.  Here
are some things I'm looking for:
        
        * Sanity check.  Does it make sense?  Am I way off base?
        * Smoke test.  Does the procedure work for you?
        * Weakness.  Could the security be improved in a practical way?
        * Readability.  Do you understand it easily?

hello!

I had some spare time today, so I took a look at the current 2.4.22 RC
with the scatterlist cryptoapi inside(tm) feature; needless to say, that
it'd be a waste of time to merge the kerneli.org cryptoapi into 2.4.22,
so I just 'backported' 2.6.0-test3's cryptoloop and while at it, mixed
in the usual loop.c 'service packs'...

*WARNING* I haven't had time yet to do major tests; I just gave it a
quick test to see whether it could 'hold' the data I threw at it -- and
it did; no tests where made to see whether the on-disk format is
compatible with previous kerneli.org cryptoapi+cryptoloop's or
2.6.0-test3 (2.6.0-test3 might be have an IV miscalculation bug, see
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=106086430703815);
only util-linux-2.12 was used for testing; 

so if the warning above hasn't scared you yet, here we have 2 patches
(which are mutually exclusive -- i.e. you have to pick exactly one)

1)
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/testing/patch-cryptoloop-hvr-2.4.22-rc2.0

this is just 2.6.0-test3's cryptoloop.c + loop-hvr-2.4 + some minor
adaptations

2)
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/testing/patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22-rc2.0

this is the same as 1) except that instead of loop-hvr-2.4, jari's
loop.c fixes+enhancements (v1.7d) have been integrated; 

ps: you might want to try ben's util-linux patches at
http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/ when trying to mount your
kerneli.org-encrypted volumes...

At HVR's request I've worked my way through the new patches and
set up. There's a bit of work remaining to be done, but the good
news is that it does work on a loopback file created on a 2.4.18
system. Here's a summary of what is required, at this time, to
get it "sort-of" working with a Debian woody dist.

Build a 2.4.22rc2 kernel. First off I did:

 tar jxf linux-2.4.21.tar.bz2
 cd linux-2.4.21
 patch -p1 &lt; ../patch-2.4.22-rc2

Then I applied:
                
 patch -p1 &lt; ../patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22-rc2.0 
 patching file crypto/Config.in
 patching file drivers/block/Config.in
 patching file drivers/block/cryptoloop.c
 patching file drivers/block/loop.c
 patching file drivers/block/Makefile
 patching file include/linux/loop.h

 patch -p1 &lt; ../patch-aes-asm-2.4.22-rc2.0 
 patching file crypto/aes-i586-asm.S
 patching file crypto/aes-i586-glue.c
 patching file crypto/Config.in
 Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] 

The conflict is due to the same bit of Config.in showing
up in both patches. I edited the overlap out of
patch-aes-asm-2.4.22-rc2.0 and re-ran the patches by skipping
the first two hunks and letting the 3rd get applied.

Download all of the materials for building a new util-linux-2.12:

 wget http://ftp.cwi.nl/aeb/util-linux/util-linux-2.12.tar.gz
 wget http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/hashalot.tar.bz2
 wget http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/losetup-keygen-prog-mk3.patch
 wget http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/losetup-variable-key-size-mk2.patch
 tar zxf util-linux-2.12.tar.gz 
 cd util-linux-2.12/
 ./configure
 make

Some build problems, I wonder if this is a version dependency in the
developer packages. I'm using the debian woody dist on this machine.

 sundries.c: In function `use_keygen_prog':
 sundries.c:343: unknown field `sa_handler' specified in initializer
 sundries.c:343: warning: missing braces around initializer
 sundries.c:343: warning: (near initialization for `sa.__sigaction_handler')
 sundries.c:344: unknown field `sa_flags' specified in initializer
 sundries.c:370: warning: assignment discards qualifiers from pointer target type
 make: *** [sundries.o] Error 1

sundries.c is needed for mount. However I can build just
losetup:

 cd util-linux-2.12/mount/
 make losetup

Gets me a new losetup. I can get buy with the standard debian 
woody mount by doing a two stage mount of old loopback file.
I did not install because that would wreck my system. I executed
all files in place.

Build the hashalot program and put it where the test will
occur:

 cd /usr/src/hashalot
 make
 cp -a hashalot  ../util-linux-2.12/mount/
 cp -a ripemd160 ../util-linux-2.12/mount/
 cd ../util-linux-2.12/mount/

This works:

  ./ripemd160 | ./losetup -p0 -e aes-cbc-256 /dev/loop3 /dma/home/amon/data
  mount /dev/loop3 /mnt

This doesn't:
  ./hashalot rmd160 | \
	./losetup -p0 -e aes-cbc-256 /dev/loop3 /dma/home/amon/data
  unknown hash type requested
  USAGE:
                hashalot _hashtype_
        OR
                _hashtype_

Question: is proper care taken in hashalot to ensure plaintext
          security? Is memory containing plaintext locked in
          memory so it cannot be swapped out?

   I see that the 2.4.21-rc2 patch adds a crypto dir to the source tree, and, of
course, when you run make xconfig, there is a crypto section to configure. It is
not at all the same as what applying the patch-int-2.4.21.0.patch puts in there,
and if you do both, you get two sections in the config to deal with -- also then
the compile pukes on the crypto section. 
   Right now I'm trying to compile just the 2.4.21 source patched with
2.4.21-rc2. Assuming that this compiles okay and I can boot it. what do I do
then to add the whole crypto api/cryptoloop to it. I've had all this working for
quite awhile, am running 2.4.19pre10 kernel right now.

I've been working on implementing an encrypted root filesystem using
Linux 2.6.0-test2-bk6's cryptoloop.  I am able to create a loopback
encrypted filesystem directly on /dev/hda5.  However, when I go to
populate the filesystem using tar, I get the following error after tar
writes all of its data:

EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #69394: 
rec_len is too small for name_len - offset = 14332, inode = 70043, rec_len = 20, 
name_len = 19
tar: usr/share/man/man3/klogctl.3.gz: Cannot create symlink to 
`../man2/syslog.2.gz': Input/output error

When I unmount the loopback encrypted filesystem and run fsck.ext2 on
/dev/loop0, I find that the filesystem has hundreds of errors on it.

I think I have a good reason create the filesystem directly on /dev/hda5.
If my initrd has to mount something to get at a loopback filesystem
image then pivot_root'ing to the mounted loopback filesystem will fail.
The old root will contain a file in use (the loopback filesystem image).

At first I thought the problem was due to /dev/hda5 being much larger
than 4GB.  I tried using a smaller partition (2 GB) but still had the
same problem.

Now I wonder if the problem is because I am trying to create a loopback
encrypted filesystem directly on a partition instead of on a file.  I have
made all kinds of file-based loopback encrypted filesystems before with
no problems.

Also, creating a loopback filesystem directly on /dev/hda5 with *no
encryption* works *fine*.  In fact, I have implemented my entire encrypted
loopback root system including the initrd, etc.  It works great.
The only problem is that right now it is using plaintext loopback!

Any ideas?

Hi all,
I am a little confused about
cryptoapi implementation on kernel 2.4.21 and 2.4.22.

I can see a new submenu named 'Cryptographic options'
wich contains various digest algorithms, aes and other.

Does anyone can explain me what is happening?

The patch-int from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/testing
will no longer be required?

Does the current kernel version contain a stable (and usable) implementation 
of cipher algorithm like aes, twofish, blowfish and serpent ?

New kernel versions will ship with a full implemention of cryptoapi and will 
not need patch?

Actually I'm running a 2.4.20 with patch-int-2.4.20-1,
and I have about 120gb of encrypted data with aes-twofish since a year ago.
I had some problems applying the patch-int-2.4.21.0 to the kernel 2.4.21.
but now with 2.4.22 and patch-cryptoloop-hvr-2.4.22.0 I can see that the 
cryptoloop support is now located under block devices and all seems ok.

Does anyone can tell me if I can upgrade to kernel 2.4.22 with the last 
cryptoloop-hvr patch without losing my data and if the new cryptographic api
is backward compatible with my 2.4.19?


Thank you

Hi,

this is a little bit off topic here, but maybe somebody can help me.

I have an encrypted drive and would like to make a backup of it. This backup 
should also be as secure as my data on disk. My simple question is: how to do 
this?

I would like to:
- backup only the data, not the whole partition (save time and media)
- be able to restore every single file or the whole partition
- have same security like on the harddisk
- backup to DVD+RW 


Thank you very much for you help in advance
Robert

Hi list,

i experienced problems as I updated my kernel-2.4.21
patched with "patch-int-2.4.21" and "loop-jari-2.4.21"
as described in:
http://www.symlink.dk/linux/cryptofs.php

with kernel-2.4.22 with integrated cryptoapi support.

I compiled the new kernel 2.4.22 like:
CONFIG_CRYPTO=y
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC is not set
CONFIG_CRYPTO_NULL=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD4=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD5=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_DES=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLOWFISH=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_TWOFISH=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SERPENT=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES=m
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEFLATE is not set
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST is not set
- ---

When I now try to mount my existing loop volume like:

/sbin/losetup -e aes -k 128 /dev/loop0 /dev/hda1

or when i try to mount a file manually with:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=test bs=512 count=20480
/sbin/losetup /dev/loop0 test -e blowfish

I get the following error: !!

The cipher does not exist, or a cipher module needs to
be loaded into the kernel
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument

If I do a "lsmod" I see the blowfish module (unused)

I use the patched "util-linux-211r-10int.i386.rpm"
as well as "losetup-2.11r-10int.i386.rpm" and "mount-2.11r-10int.i396.rpm".
(with RedHat 9)

Do I have to use newer versions of these programms ??


What about:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/testing/patch-aes-asm-2.4.22.0
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/testing/patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0

Do I need this ones additionally ?


Hopefully someone could bring some insight on this topic ?

Yes. You'll need to get the new util-linux from:
&lt;URL:http://ftp.cwi.nl/aeb/util-linux/util-linux-2.12.tar.gz&gt;

And apply these patches:
&lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/losetup-variable-key-size-mk2.patch&gt;
&lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/losetup-keygen-prog-mk4.patch&gt;

&gt; What about:
&gt; http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/testing/patch-aes-asm-2.4.22.0

This is a Pentium-optimized implementation of AES, written in assembly.

&gt; http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/testing/patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0

This is an alternative to patch-cryptoloop-hvr-2.4.22.0. It includes
enhancements from Jari Ruusu's loop-AES code, including the ability
to use a cryptoloop device as swap.

Here's an example from the alpha tests I've been running for 
HVR and slusky:

  ./ripemd160 | ./losetup -p0 -e aes-cbc-256 /dev/loop3 data
  mount /dev/loop3 /mnt

Note the password is now the hashed result, not the plaintext.
You need slusky's hashalot if you have't gotten it yet.

Back it up using normal tar, but pipe the tar archive through gpg or
aespipe. Tar has no problems writing to stdout, and gpg (or aespipe) has no
problems reading from stdin.

1) Tar your files:
tar -cpPWvf $ARCHIVE $DIR

2) Encrypt your files:
gpg -c --cipher-algo $GPG_CIPHER_ALGO_NAME $ARCHIVE

3) Wipe your tar archive from HDD:
wipe -qf $ARCHIVE

4) Copy $ARCHIVE.gpg to storage media.

You can use EncryptedVirtualFileSystem http://hysteria.sk/evfs
to avoid writing (and wiping) temporary archive to HDD and
economize free space.

P.S. May be kernelI.org developers combine some ideas from EVFS
and current kernelI to one project?

I can encrypt partition and swap and can't make encrypted temp
dir or tempFS to avoid writing variable length sensitive files to disk!

See "tar --help". I don't know what your -o is supposed to do. Generally
GNU tar writes to stdout by default, so you just do something like this:
  tar -cp files-to-backup | gpg -c &gt; outputfile
Then decrypt with this:
  gpg outputfile &gt; secret.tar
or restore with this:
  gpg outputfile | tar -xp

&gt; and my swap is encrypted, can some unencrypted temp files be 
&gt; created in /tmp or another dir?

I think neither tar nor gpg does this. (If gpg does, it's a SERIOUS
security hole!) But to be safe, if you're using bash:
  export TMPDIR=/path/to/an/encrypted/fs
IIUC most things will use $TMPDIR for temporary files, but some may be
hard-coded to use /tmp.

mkCDrec does this, though I don't know if I'd trust the security features
quite yet.  I tend to think that encrypted backups may be foolish.
Why can't you backup to plaintext and put the media in a secure location?

Be careful to consider that if anything goes wrong with any of the bits
in your backup or with your keys then you might be out of luck!

Looks like it might; before I applied that patch I was unable to

it works.

Herbert,

You are breaking stable 2.4 kernel API again. The IV parameter in loop
transfer function in 2.4 kernels is of type 'int' not 'u32'. This change
breaks all other existing transfer functions that rely on stable API.

Please revert that parameter back to 'int' type.

 URGENT AND CONFIDENTAL
email  
 

My Dear,

Good a thing to write you. I have a proposal for
you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in
any manner compel you to honour against your will. 

I am MISS justina mohamed ,19years old and the only
daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.Mohamed. My
father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa
merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast
during his days.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in
France 
during one of his business trips abroad year
12th.Febuary 
2000.Though his sudden death was linked or rather
suspected 
to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who
travelled 
with him at that time.
But God knows the truth!

My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since
then 
my father took me so special. Before his death 
on Febuary 12 2000 he called the secretary who
accompanied 
him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum
of 
twentfive million,seven hundred thousand United State 
Dollars.(USD$25.700,000) left in a security company in
a mettalic trunk box,but the security company didn't
know the content because it was registered as family
valuables for security reasons.He further told him
that he deposited the money in my 
name,and finally issued a written instruction to his
lawyer 
whom he said is in possession of all the necessary but

legal documents to this fund and the bank.

I am just 19 years old and a universityundergraduate
and really don't know what to do.Now I want an account
overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is
because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result
of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The
death of my father actually broughtsorrow to my life.

Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance
in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be
highly regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 
1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter? 
2. Can I completely trust you? 
3. What percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account? 

Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as 
possible. 

Thank you so much.

My sincere regards,

MISS justina mohamed

Dear all:

Today, I payed attention to linux-crypto for the first time and Im amazed on how easy \
is to make it run! (at least, XOR encryption, see below)

I found a problem:

debian's losetup version is 2.11z. After some "LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument" \
errors, when trying to use 'twofish'  (everything worked  as expected if I use XOR), \
I found the following note on the manual:

BUGS:
       CAST, DES, RC5 and Twofish are currently broken and cannot be used.

so, I downloaded 2.12pre and on the manual it says:
       -e encryption
              enable data encryption. The following keywords are recognized:

              NONE   use no encryption (default).
              XOR    use a simple XOR encryption.
              DES    use  DES  encryption. DES encryption is only available if
                     the optional DES package has been added  to  the  kernel.
                     DES  encryption  uses  an  additional start value that is
                     used to protect passwords against dictionary attacks.

So: how do I use twofish encryption? on 2.11z is buggy and 2.12pre doesn't has the \
option to do it!

I've adapted 

http://clemens.endorphin.org/patches/aes-i586-asm-2.5.58.diff

for 2.4.22-rc2, and put it up at

http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/testing/patch-aes-asm-2.4.22-rc2.0 
for now you can build either a generic aes cipher, or the asm optimized
one (if you configured for a pentium compatible arch); should work for
static linkage as well as for module building;

I compared its performance to the gcc-3.2.2 compiled c implementation of
the AES algo wrt to cryptoloop usage, and got the following results on
an old pentium classic @ 133mhz box 
(the data was acquired with "zcav -b 10M /dev/loop0"):
          
               C-version    ASM-version 
aes-cbc-128    ~860K/s      ~1300K/s 
aes-cbc-256    ~690K/s      ~1050K/s           

thus the ASM version results in ~50% more throughput on a p5-133mhz for
my simple test;

it would be interesting to know how the ASM version performs relative to
the C-version on pentiumII/III/IV's/... since the inclusion of the asm
optimized AES in 2.6.0-test3 depends on whether there are significant
gains on other chips but pentium-classics

Works fine for me on Gentoo 1.4... try replacing lines 342-345 with a
non-C99 initializer, and see if that helps:

	struct sigaction sa = {

	};

&gt; This works:

Hashalot is kinda picky about the "ipe" in "ripemd160". Is it better

&gt; Question: is proper care taken in hashalot to ensure plaintext

Not at all... I'll see what I can do about that.

Ok, I've uploaded a new patch with that code. The world will have to wait

&gt; 2.4.21-rc2. Assuming that this compiles okay and I can boot it. what do I do
&gt; then to add the whole crypto api/cryptoloop to it. I've had all this working for
&gt; quite awhile, am running 2.4.19pre10 kernel right now.

hmmm... two choices I see:

1) wait for HVR and slusky to sign off on the work they're doing and 
   I've been testing for them

2) Work with the alpha state patches from them. I'm sure they'll
   both be happy to give you pointers to the lot of them. You can
   refer to my recent post on an earlier test... I think most
   of the problems I uncovered are already fixed.

Good Day, 



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, 
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will 
be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me 
since you do not know me personally. 
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this 
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a 
person of integrity. 

My name is Graham Koroma, the first son of Paul Koroma, 
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered 
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, 
I decided to contact you through email, after searching 
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means 
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with 
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. 

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The 
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed 
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and 
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President 
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly 
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black 
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my 
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. 



Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business 
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in 
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit 
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred 
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This 
money was deposited with this Private Security company for 
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the 
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment 
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent 
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the 
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. 

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from 
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but 
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder 
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the 
Spain where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my 
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security 
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they 
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here. 

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part 
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee 
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved 
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a 
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can 
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to 
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future 
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. 

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is 
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the 
security company from their office in Netherlands, 
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa 
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you 
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you. 

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your 
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money 
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with 
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. 
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I 
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of 
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% 
($580,000,00) for Charity donation. 

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an 
account, 
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want 
you 
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction. 
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you 
in 
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my 
direct line which is 34-680-487-233 or via email, grahamkoroma@indiatimes.com 



Sincerely, 

Graham Koroma

Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Becky Coleman wife to the late Chife Paul Coleman from 
Sierra Leon. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek 
your assistance to transfer our cash of thirty  Million Dollars 
($30,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe 
the money is in trunk boxes
deposited and declared as Precious stones by my late Husband as a 
matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my 
husband made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:

My late Husband Chief Paul Coleman , a native of  Mende District in 
the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra 
Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my 
Husband, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales. 

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major 
Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that 
almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power 
of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My 
Husband had already made arrangement for  I and my two children to be 
evacuated to Ivory coast with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT  he made with a 
security firm in Europe through the aid of U.N evacuation team. 

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting 
of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone
mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My 
husband including other top Government functionaries were attaked and 
killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the 
civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my husbands's death , and with the information we got 
that the rebelsa are out for us the burden became too much for me to 
handle coupled with the ill health of my dauther she died in the process as 
i could not afford her a decent medical care.

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm
To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.

1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security
  Firm as our beneficiary

2. to transfer this money (USD$30M) in your name to your country

3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our 
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager


For your assistance, I have agreed with my only surviving son that 20% 
of the total amount will be for your effort and another 10 % to cover all the expenses
that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I urge you to 
keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one knows our where about.

Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name, 
address and Tel/ Fax numbers, to me via my private email address as 
indicated bellow, this is for security reasons as i will  only be accessing my 
private email earnestly awaiting your response.


Thanks.

May God bless you as you assist us.

Mrs. BECKY COLEMAN.

Your one-liner worked great.  I had avoided newer kernels because they would not

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Removed now unnecessary module locking hacks on 2.6 kernels.
- loop.c-2.6.patched updated with fixes from 2.6.0-test4
- loop.c-2.4.patched updated with ioctl fixes from 2.4.22 and 2.4.20-SuSE-86
  kernel.
- Removed SEPARATEMODULEDIR setting from build-initrd.sh. Now /linuxrc loads
  modules from /boot/modules-KERNELRELEASE/ directory.
- Swapon now skips first page of swap partitions when setting up encrypted
  swaps. This leaves unencrypted swap signature page untouched. Based on
  code from Yoav Weiss.

&gt; I am a little confused about
&gt; cryptoapi implementation on kernel 2.4.21 and 2.4.22.

&gt; I can see a new submenu named 'Cryptographic options'
&gt; wich contains various digest algorithms, aes and other.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone can explain me what is happening?

that is a backport to 2.4 of the 2.6 scatterlist based cryptoapi;
 
&gt; The patch-int from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/testing
&gt; will no longer be required?
starting with (mainstream) 2.4.22 the patch won't apply anymore;

but 2.4.22 only contains the cryptoapi, nothing more!

if you want ipsec or cryptoloop support, you'll have to apply additional
patches anyway;

&gt; Does the current kernel version contain a stable (and usable) implementation 
&gt; of cipher algorithm like aes, twofish, blowfish and serpent ?

many cipher implementations in the current kernel version use the same
implementations that were part of the patch-int's of previous kernel
versions; 

&gt; New kernel versions will ship with a full implemention of cryptoapi and will 
&gt; not need patch?

yes; except that 2.4 (as opposed to 2.6) will need patches to add
cryptoloop and/or ipsec capatibilites;
 
&gt; Actually I'm running a 2.4.20 with patch-int-2.4.20-1,
&gt; and I have about 120gb of encrypted data with aes-twofish since a year ago.

&gt; I had some problems applying the patch-int-2.4.21.0 to the kernel 2.4.21.
&gt; but now with 2.4.22 and patch-cryptoloop-hvr-2.4.22.0 I can see that the 
&gt; cryptoloop support is now located under block devices and all seems ok.
 
&gt; Does anyone can tell me if I can upgrade to kernel 2.4.22 with the last 
&gt; cryptoloop-hvr patch without losing my data and if the new cryptographic api
&gt; is backward compatible with my 2.4.19?

the API itself is not backward compatible, the old api was based on
unfragmented contiguous memory buffers for operations, while the new
api is based on scatterlist buffers; I assume what you really care
for, is whether the algorithms are compatible -- well yes, they
should, since the specs and the test vectors are the same (*)

quick tests have shown it to be compatible -- (*)except for a few ciphers
which got endian reversed (such as serpent), but that's something
you'll notice the moment you try to mount a volumen...; but only
long-term testing will show whether the new framework is robust;

should you experience lockups with patch-cryptoloop-hvr, I'd recommend
you try patch-cryptoloop-jari, which implements aggressive buffering;

ps: I can't give you any guarantee about not losing your data, since
the code is rather new and hasn't had much time to prove it's
reliability yet; I'd recommend you try to mount read-only your
partitions and see whether your data is still non-corrupt, that would
at least test the read/deciphering code paths and show that decoding
is compatible; then you could create a new dummy volume and stresstest
write/read on it, while comparing data integrity, that would show that
reading and writing with the new code does work; that together with
the read-only test of your 'old' data should prove that the new
framework is usable, and you might want to risk mounting your old data
volumes read/write... but still, if your data is important, you should
backup it nevertheless;

&gt; Why can't you backup to plaintext and put the media in a secure location?

You might want to be able to destroy your backup at a future date.
Thoroughly destroying a hard disk or a DVD is some work; burning the
piece of paper with the key on it is easy.

Hi,=20

Twofish is now available as assembler implementation for Pentium/PentiumPro.

I've ported the assembler sources of the public domain Twofish
implementation of Counterpane to cryptoapi. Everyone how has ever locked at
2fish_86.asm will for sure admit that it's next to impossible to change it's
assembler: masm. Instead of rewriting everything in nasm or gas, I've
decided to take a shortcut. I used masm to compile it.

That's for sure a sin and I will burn in free software hell, but don't
worry. You don't have to touch masm. I supplied precompiled binaries for you
and as you won't need to port it to another architecture precompiled
binaries are just fine.

http://clemens.endorphin.org/twofish-i586/

However, the first test looks promissing. It's almost twice as fast as the C
implementation. So I think it's worth trying.

FYI in case you'd like to play with the source: It's possible to work
without a Windows environment. Wine runs masm perfectly and masm is
available through some special tricks for free (as in beer). Just have a
look at INSTALL.Linux.

Regards, Clemens

I have been using Linux 2.6.0-test4 and util-linux 2.12 successfully
to encrypt my root partition and swap.  However, recently I was using
mkisofs and my system hung.  After trying a few more times I realized
that the hang happened consistently when I tried to create a large CD
(~650MB) image (small images don't call a hang).

My computer is a PowerPC-based iBook.

When hung, my system is unusable.  I can't log in and I can't execute
programs using sessions that were already logged in.  Changing virtual
consoles works, though.  When run by strace, mkisofs makes it to the point
where it is reading and writing the image data.  Then everything hangs on
a read.  I have tried turning my swap off but the results are the same.

I also ran top during this process.  Right before being hung, top displays
the following information:

0.9% user, 99.1% system, 0.0% nice, 0.0% idle, 0.0% IO-wait

Top says the following processes were "running" when the system hung:
mkisofs, pdflush and top.

Top seems to indicate that I have plenty of memory available, 2,368K is
free and 24,860K is just tied up is buffers.

Other than this mkisofs-triggered problem cryptoloop seems to work fine.

I have a complete strace of mkisofs available if anyone would like to
see it.

| Yes. You'll need to get the new util-linux from:
| &lt;URL:http://ftp.cwi.nl/aeb/util-linux/util-linux-2.12.tar.gz&gt;
|
| And apply these patches:

| &lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/losetup-keygen-prog-mk4.patch&gt;


O.K., done that, but now I get the error:

ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument


Is that an error with the aes module ??

Mr.Andrew Buthelezi( B.Sc.,M.Sc. MNIM.)
Director, Project Implementation
 

 STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT

 I am Mr.Andrew Buthelezi Mbeki a native of Cape Town in South Africa and the \
director of project implementation with the South Africa Department of Minerals &amp; \
Natural Resources.   First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you \
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and \
prompt access reposed on this medium. I have decided to seek a confidential \
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the  \
benefit of all parties  and hope you will keep  it as a top secret because of the \
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals &amp; Natural Resources where I work as a Director and \
with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as \
overdue payment bills totaling Eight Million, Five hundred Thousand US. Dollars \
(US$8.500.000.00) which   we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and \
cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or \
a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are \
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct \
does not allow us to   operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole \
transaction.

This amount $8.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on \
behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials \
over-invoiced deliberately.  
Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving \
the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten \
approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank \
account you will  provide by filing in an application through the Ministry of Justice \
here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former \
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to \
assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum is 25% of the total,while me and \
my collegues receives 70% and the remaining 5% for all miscallanous expenses and \
taxation. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with \
utmost secrecy and confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not a \
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. Endeavor to contact me \
immediately through my confidential fax No.or email address above to confirm whether \
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not,  it will enable me scout for \
another foreign partner to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that my partners \
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you \
can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and \
please, remember to treat this matter very confidential  because we will not \
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service \
.Once again, remember that time is of great essence in this transaction. Positive \
response should be accompanied with your telephone and fax number so i can reach you \
immediately with more informations. I wait in anticipation of your fullest \
co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Andrew Buthelezi

Hi,
 
Can anyone tell me how widely spread is the use of CryptoAPI?
Where can I find common stacks/applications/etc. using it (sources I can use as a reference)?
 
Thanks,

Hi,

Can someone explain me the difference between cryptoapi and cryptoaip2 ? Is \
cryptoapi2 version is extension of cryptoapi ? Is cryptoapi version a stand alone \
patch or it needs the cryptoapi?

													Thanks in advance

Yes, on-disk formats are compatible.

If you use loop-AES' loop.o module with mount+losetup from kerneli.org, no
other change is needed. However, mount+losetup from loop-AES package use
slightly different syntax and defaults:

kerneli.org syntax:

    mount -t ext3 /dev/??? /mnt -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=aes,keybits=128
                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
loop-AES syntax:

    mount -t ext3 /dev/??? /mnt -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,phash=rmd160
                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OK, I know, but what exactly causes this problem?

&gt; Did you compile and install the cryptoapi-specific

Thanks Thomas, I had the util-linux2.11z.
Patched and compiled 2.11r and now it's working great.

Hi,
  I am tryin to understand how does the blowfish cipher work.  When does
it use the ecb mode and when does it use the cfb mode?  Can we configure
the blowfish cipher to run in either of the modes?
  I am using the patch-int-2.4.12 patch for linux 2.4.20 kernel.

Thank you,

Mr.Andrew Buthelezi( B.Sc.,M.Sc. MNIM.) 
 Director, Project Implementation

 STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT

 I am Mr.Andrew Buthelezi Mbeki a native of Cape Town in South Africa and the \
director of project implementation with the South Africa Department of Minerals &amp; \
Natural Resources.   First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you \
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and \
prompt access reposed on this medium. I have decided to seek a confidential \
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the  \
benefit of all parties  and hope you will keep  it as a top secret because of the \
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals &amp; Natural Resources where I work as a Director and \
with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as \
overdue payment bills totaling Eight Million, Five hundred Thousand US. Dollars \
(US$8.500.000.00) which   we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and \
cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or \
a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are \
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct \
does not allow us to   operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole \
transaction.

This amount $8.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on \
behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials \
over-invoiced deliberately.  
Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving \
the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten \
approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank \
account you will  provide by filing in an application through the Ministry of Justice \
here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former \
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to \
assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum is 25% of the total,while me and \
my collegues receives 70% and the remaining 5% for all miscallanous expenses and \
taxation. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with \
utmost secrecy and confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not a \
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. Endeavor to contact me \
immediately through my confidential fax No.or email address above to confirm whether \
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not,  it will enable me scout for \
another foreign partner to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that my partners \
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you \
can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and \
please, remember to treat this matter very confidential  because we will not \
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service \
.Once again, remember that time is of great essence in this transaction. Positive \
response should be accompanied with your telephone and fax number so i can reach you \
immediately with more informations. I wait in anticipation of your fullest \
co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Andrew Buthelezi

Hello!

Currently I'm using patch-int and loop-hvr on top of lvm volume (couple of
disks glued together) with 2.4.21-pre4 kernel..

After about a month of uptime, the mountpoint where this ext3+cryptoloop+lvm
thing was mounted, got stuck. 

You could "ls" on the top dir of the mountpoint, but everywhere else "ls" would freeze. 

All attempts to create a new dir or file got stuck.. the processes froze and you 
could not kill them. You couldn't read the files either.

The system load was rising all the time (when the loads where like 60 I decided to reboot).

You could not umount the filesystem, or kill the processes accessing the fs.

Well, now I have again 29 days of uptime, so I think it might explode again
soon :) 

Are there any known problems with this cryptoloop-solution? I'm using AES as
the cipher.

Well anyway I'm going to upgrade to 2.4.21 if/when the mountpoint freezees..

Btw. what's the preferred method nowadays? I read somewhere that
chipher-aes-i586 would be a lot faster.. with current solution I get
~5MB/sec speeds on a P3/450. 

Should I be using cryptoapi or something else?
Are they compatible with the current patch-int+loop-hvr solution?

Thanks!

Hi

I would like to know if somebody has got xfs running successfully on a
crypto-device like loop-hvr, loop-jari or cryptoloop (which is the same
as loo-hvr I think). I only get tons of strange io-errors but the
underlaying disk is ok.

Hi,

I read there are people here that are running 2.4.21 with crypto
support. I've been trying, but with no success.
So far, what I've done is this:
applied the patch-int-2.4.21.0 and the loop-jari-2.4.21.0.patch.
Configured the kernel,build everything inside the first time. 
Second time I made modules (cryptoloop, loop, ciphers,...).
Nothing works though.
Without modules I get ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument when
doing losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 $home/cryptofile.

With the other kernel with modules, the modules won't even load when I
insmod them:

# insmod cryptoloop
Using /lib/modules/2.4.21/kernel/crypto/drivers/cryptoloop.o
/lib/modules/2.4.21/kernel/crypto/drivers/cryptoloop.o: unresolved
symbol find_transform_by_name_R94d0ebe8

Any help on this would be appreciated.

I was giving 2.6.0-test2 a spin, and run into a few issues with
loopback crypto:

First of all, in util-linux 2.12 the keybits option is gone, and the
number of keybits is fixed to 256 (even though some algorithms in the
kernel support more). Is this a temporary thing or a design decision?

Moving to the slightly more ontopic stuff for lk@vger: Is access to
the cryptoapi algorithms exposed to userspace yet? I wanted to have
losetup/mount hash the passphrase before passing it to the kernel, and
it seems silly to actually put a separate hashing algorithm in
util-linux when they're there in the kernel anyway.

Thirdly, has the encryption setup changed again since 2.4.x with hvr's
testing cryptoapi stuff? I have a filesystem encrypted with 256 bits
serpent, yet it won't decrypt using 2.6.0-test2 and util-linux 2.12.

Lastly: Why the move from a /proc/crypto directory containing files
for all the algorithms to one monolithic /proc/crypto file? Isn't the
former a lot nicer from the userspace programmer's point of view?

No, there is no point (apart from testing) unless the kernel API is 
providing access to crypto hardware.

The kerneli serpent implementation is incorrect (it's reversed, a common

Possibly, although it's probably too late to change now for 2.6.

&gt; No, there is no point (apart from testing) unless the kernel API is 
&gt; providing access to crypto hardware.
Even if we don't have the drivers yet, the sooner it's available and
in use the better, then we can always drop in hardware support later.
(Still, I'm not volunteering for either job so I won't complain, just
wondering if it had been done)

Owch. But I assume this didn't sneak in since the testing cryptoAPI
patches? Or have the algorithms been redone?

But why was it ever changed to on big file in the first place?

&gt; 

This is a new API, so it wasn't really changed.  The single file is
simpler and less bloated from the kernel point of view.  This may change 
down the track with hardware support.

The patches I got were maximal, too much junk.
So I went for a minimal version instead.

It is usable (when the kernel part is stable, which it isn't today)
but mount/losetup may well acquire a few options before it is
conveniently usable.

(I do not read crypto lists, and see only a very small fraction of
what passes by on lk, so if you want to influence util-linux
an explicit cc is a good idea.)

&gt; has the encryption setup changed again since 2.4.x with hvr's

cryptoloop as it went in is essentially hvr's.

Can we discuss those options now? I find the latest losetup to be
completely unusable, tho' I appreciate the effort that's gone into it
so far.

Firstly, are the other key size choices (128-bit, 192-bit) gone for
good? If so then I'll need to redo this entire hard disk (which currently
uses 128-bit AES) before I can test 2.6 on my laptop.

Secondly, there's the issue of passphrase hashing. I agree with the
decision to cut it out of losetup, but where do we put it now? Andries
has suggested an external program, but this isn't as simple as it sounds.
To get this working would require a new way of reading the passphrase,
since the hashed passphrase might contain a newline, or a null. Maybe
change the semantics of the -p option, so that:

	losetup -e aes /dev/loop/10 /home/sluskyb/testloop

will work when I give it the passphrase "foobar", but also

	pwhash -h sha1 |losetup -e aes -k 128 -p 0 /dev/loop/0 \
		/dev/discs/disc0/part3

will read exactly 16 bytes of (probably) non-printable chars and use
that as the key.

Questions? Comments? Flames?

    uses 128-bit AES) before I can test 2.6 on my laptop.

We need some discussion - there is no hurry.

Consider:
Crypto users are a small minority. On the other hand, every Linux user
needs mount. Also in emergency situations. Possibly from a rescue floppy.

Consider:
mount is suid root.

Both reasons imply that it is undesirable to add a lot of messy code
to mount, quite apart from maintainability.

If the messy code is in an external program of which the path name
is given as a -o option, then the correctness of the external program
is the invokers responsibility, and it doesnt take space on the rescue
floppies of non crypto users.

Consider:
Most people want to invoke losetup from mount. But we just concluded
that it is desirable to try and prevent bloating mount. Yes, it is
full of garbage already, but that is no reason to add even more.

You want key size choices. OK. I don't like to add another option
to mount. Probably all encryption stuff can be part of the -o encryption=
option. How is stuff coded? Well, everybody can invent some suitable
syntax. The one I like best wins. Proposals complete with (nice, readable)
code get bonus points.

    Secondly, there's the issue of passphrase hashing. I agree with the
    decision to cut it out of losetup, but where do we put it now? Andries

            /dev/discs/disc0/part3

    will read exactly 16 bytes of (probably) non-printable chars and use
    that as the key.

Sounds entirely reasonable. This is good for doing things "by hand".
But people also want to have crypto mounts described in /etc/fstab.
The option column there should contain all information needed to do
the losetup and mount.

I would be most happy if people on crypto lists would discuss details.
I do not think this belongs on linux-kernel.

&gt; Secondly, there's the issue of passphrase hashing. I agree with the
&gt; decision to cut it out of losetup, but where do we put it now? Andries
&gt; has suggested an external program, but this isn't as simple as it sounds.
&gt; To get this working would require a new way of reading the passphrase,
&gt; since the hashed passphrase might contain a newline, or a null. Maybe
&gt; change the semantics of the -p option, so that:
&gt;
&gt;	losetup -e aes /dev/loop/10 /home/sluskyb/testloop
&gt;
&gt; will work when I give it the passphrase "foobar", but also
&gt;
&gt;	pwhash -h sha1 |losetup -e aes -k 128 -p 0 /dev/loop/0 \
&gt;		/dev/discs/disc0/part3
&gt;
&gt; will read exactly 16 bytes of (probably) non-printable chars and use
&gt; that as the key.

I've implemented an external PAM module (pam_losetup) that hashes a
passphrase (obtained from PAM) along with a stored salt value, and then
uses it to decrypt a stored filesystem key (both the key and the salt are
stored in a system keyfile, by default /etc/qpasswd). This is then piped
to losetup (the format of the piped key probably needs to change).

Try out qryptix-0.1 (on sourceforge, probably mirrored elsewhere) for
this and some additional utilities to generate and manage the encrypted
keys. There is some minimal documentation on getting it going, but no
man pages yet. I'm using it on a number of machines (mostly laptops)
to secure my home directory.

Comments, suggestions, patches would be welcome.
(Not sure if this will make it past the spam filter at linux-crypto, so
I'm cc'ing it).

Yes, I've seen pam_mount; although it's not a strict superset of the
capabilities of pam_losetup, it has significantly more functionality. My
aim with pam_losetup was to keep it very minimalist, and focus on retrieving
keys, hashing and setting up encrypted loops.

&gt;  In fact, if you can find an 
&gt;August issue of the Linux Journal, you will find an article on this very
subject 
&gt;(though it addresses Linux 2.4's cryptoloop).

Actually, pam_losetup also addresses 2.4's cryptoloop, but the changes to
accomodate 2.6 should be minimal (a few /dev path names and perhaps changes
in losetup invocation). Sorry for not making this clear.

&gt; Pam_mount also allows one to change their system password without
changing their 
&gt;encrypted filesystem's key (which can easily be truly random/maximum
entropy 
&gt;because the user does not need to remember it).

Exactly the same idea in pam_losetup; I derive the filesystem key from
/dev/random before encrypting it. I also added a salt to the passphrase
hash to foil dictionary attacks on the passphrase. I'm currently using
md5crypt to derive 128 bits for the internal des_ede operation to encrypt/
decrypt the filesystem key (it's probably sufficient to use DES, since
the entropy of the unencrypted filesystem key is maximal). 

The main pros of pam_losetup are:

1) The addition of the system keyfile, /etc/qpasswd greatly reduces the
clutter/overload in /etc/fstab. The options field was getting cluttered
with all the 'cipher=' and 'keybits=' stuff, which is all now relocated
to /etc/ qpasswd.

The format of an entry in /etc/qpasswd is simple and minimal:

&lt;login_name&gt;:&lt;loopdev_index&gt;:&lt;loop_container&gt;:&lt;cipher&gt;:&lt;keysize&gt;:&lt;salt&gt;:&lt;key
&gt;

Both the salt and key are base64 encoded, so it's possible to keep the line
below 80 chars (I like my text files to fit without line-wrap :-).

I've included a simple library to manipulate keyfiles, with the routines
fgetqpent(), getqpent(), setqpent(), endqpent() &amp; putqpent(). The semantics
are similar if not identical to the passwd file handling routines in
glibc - fgetpwent(), ... .

2) Focus on key management: all the user (filesystem) keys are kept
together,
so interesting things can be done with them (key backup, escrow, etc.).
Also,
the keyfile can be kept on removable media, for more security.

3) mount has a much simpler task - it can look at a more classical, 
uncluttered, /etc/fstab, which will have simple entry linking the loop
device and the home directory (or any other directory, for that matter).

4) It's still possible to use pam_mount in the PAM stack following
pam_losetup, for example:

...
auth    required /lib/security/pam_losetup.so ...
session required /lib/security/pam_losetup.so ...
auth    required /lib/secuirty/pam_mount.so ...
session required /lib/security/pam_mount.so ...
...

For certain applications (like login), pam_losetup plus a redirection login
script in a dummy home directory, seems to be sufficient.

Cons:

1) Nested encrypted loops, possible with pam_mount, are not possible with
pam_losetup, although multiple encrypted loops, with directory nesting, are
still possible (it's not possible to keep the container file within another
encrypted filesystem, which is not that much of a downside).
 
Possible future directions include a merge of the codebases of pam_losetup
and pam_mount, though it seems not to be necessary in the light of 4) above.
I'm pretty pleased with my introduction of the concept of keyfiles, so I'd
like to keep that in pam_losetup.

I think a simple pam_losetup, which handles keys and loop setup, and a
simple
pam_mount, which handles mounts only, might be a good general direction to
head.

Comments, suggestions, etc. welcome.

&gt; 
&gt; It is usable (when the kernel part is stable, which it isn't today)

&gt; conveniently usable.

I'm not sure what value of stable you want, I've been using 2.6.0-test1
(ac?) with crypto since it came out. Clearly there are a lot of things
missing before 2.6 is ready for general use, but it sure is nice to have
that filesystem protected. The crypto seems stable, as long as that's the
main thing you do with the box.

I hope we can get the control of key length back, while I doubt that
anyone who actually could break the default is going to be involved in
anything I do, I'd like to see it for future applications.

Thats good i trying with this but when i try to mount encrypted loop device
it want me to type a password on command line i know command like
echo "pass" | mount -p 0 /directory/file /mnt-target -t jfs -o loop=/dev/loop0,encrypting=xor
in this way is good but password is stored on hard drive and that seems very unsecure way
but i don't want to encrypt root-filesystem only /etc directory any ideas ?

Your untrusted users should perhaps be chroot'ed. *Or* don't give out
shell accounts to untrustworthy users. :)

You never want to have your crypto passwords written to disk!

&gt; but i don't want to encrypt root-filesystem only /etc directory any ideas ?

/etc *must* be on the root filesystem. Many files in /etc are used as
the system boots. fstab, for example (one of the ones you seem to feel
insecure about?) is read. inittab is the map of the whole process.

Some /etc files could be symbolic links to files elsewhere (such as an
encrypted filesystem.) You would need to understand the init process to
determine which ones. Other /etc files (passwd and various system-wide
configuration files for user software) must be readable by all users.

I think once you gain an understanding of what's needed, you will no
longer want to do this. I remember seeing a chroot HOWTO once. You might
also be interested in access control mechanisms such as grsecurity. And
the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard ( http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ ) can
help to explain why /etc can't be separate from the / filesystem.

if i can't is there have a way to encrypt only some config files with
symlinks to /etc on encrypted loop device but in this way i must wrote
my crypto password somewhere because i'm not able to type password
everytime when server boot and ask for password to mount encrypted loop
device and if i wrote it somewhere on hard drive this is insecure and
for users i don't have users :) the big problem is when someone steal
server what happen can i prevent this person from mount, view my hard
drive ?

kgb:

If I understand you correctly:

1) you need to store the password on some media readable by the computer 
because the machine may need to reboot without user intervention -- you 
want it to start up without typing a password.

2) you are concerned about people with physical access to the computer.



This is a reasonable collection of concerns for a co-located server (for 
example). But it is particularly difficult to solve.

Generally, a way to solve the "no user intervention" issue is to write 
the password on some media, called an access token. You could use a CD, 
USB drive, or a smart card.

The problem is that you will need to keep the token inserted into the 
computer, defeating any security advantage, I think.


The only way I can think of is for you to use an init RAM disk to 
acquire the token (password) from another computer, via a network 
connection. Then if the computer is ever stolen, you can disable this 
token (remotely, if need be).

This remote-token approach is at least as difficult as encrypted-root, 
which I think you will need anyway.

Consider using an NFS-boot ramdisk to get started.

best of luck,

I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with this as well. I'd prefer not 
to fully crypt root either as I'd rather not have the hassle and performance 
hit for accessing unimportant data.

Scripting this:

	kernel cmdline (grub/lilo): init=/linuxrc
	/linuxrc:
		#!/bin/sh
		##get password(YMMV) and 'mount -n' partition with /etc
		##mount other partitions with /var/log, and so on.....
		exec /sbin/init	#Normal boot will proceed.

Will get you around having to maintain any sort of an initrd system. 
There are otherways to do it, but this mucks least with your 'normal' boot 
sequence. The only problem here is syncing /etc/mtab up with the
information of the partition /etc  is on. I think this must be done by 'hand' 
(IE echo  &gt;&gt;/etc/mtab), as -o remount doesn't seem to update mtab.

Is loop-aes compatible with the patch-int+loop-hvr crypted fs ?

It's a little difficult to move all the data to some temp-hdd and then to

reply to : mabukobryan@netscape.net
Attention: Sir/Madam
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION
I am interested in your partnership in business dealing. This business =
proposal I wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and it?s success is =
entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of =
confidentiality as regard this transaction.
I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committe of =
the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance to =
enable me transfer the sum of US$35,500,000.00 (Thirty-five Million, Five =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.
The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on =
behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign =
contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million =
United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was =
awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$144,500,000.00 (One =
hundred and Forty-four Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) =
to my benefit unknown to the contractor. This contract has been =
satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently =
securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all =
foreign contract payment approval.
As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law =
to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to you =
seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company =
account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the =
Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of =
US$35,500,000.00 (Thirty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States =
Dollars) into your provided account.
On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.
1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary
2. 80% of the fund will be for Us.
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth =
actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of =
commencement. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, =
please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification.
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.
Yours Sincerely,
Dr.mabuko Bryan.

Request for Urgent Business Relationship

Dear Sir,Madam

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This
is virtue of it\'s nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

We are top officials of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract
Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our 
country 
and investing in Europe with Funds which are presently trapped in 
Nigeria.in order to commence this business we solicit your assistance, 
knowledge and expertise to enable us receive
the said trapped funds abroad,for the subsequent purchase and inventory 
of the goods to be imported and the investment in Europe.


The source of this fund is as follows: during the previous Military
regimes in our country, Government Officials set up Companies and 
awarded 
themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various 
Ministries.

The new Civilian Government now setup a Contract Review Panel
which i and my colleagues are Members and we have identified a lot of 
inflated sum,due to our position as Civil Servants and members of this 
panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I have therefore, 
been 
delegated as a matter of trust by my col
leagues of the panel to look for an oversea partner into whose account 
the sum of SD$31,000,000,00 (Thirty-One Million United States
Dollars) will be paid by telegraphic transfer. Hence we are written you 
this letter.

We have agreed to share the money thus:
1. 70% for us (the officials)
2. 20% for the foreign partner(you)
3. 10% to be used in settling taxation and local and foreign
expenses.

It is this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business
and the investment in Europe.

Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope that
the funds can arrive your account in latest ten(10) banking days from 
the 
date of receipt of the following information.A suitable company name 
and 
bank account (company or personnel)into which the funds can be paid.

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and
job description respectively.This way we will use your 
company\'s 
name 
to 
apply for payments and re-award the contract to your company name.

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit
your confidentiality in this transaction.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter using my alternate  e-mail 
address only  akwils@excite.com


I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending project
when I have heard from you.

Yours faithfully,
Mr.Akande  Wilson

hello friend,
 
Though i am encountering you first through writing but i will like  to introduce \
myself to you.I am Her excellency Mrs  Prisca Edward Taylor,the first wife of the \
embattled president of the republic of liberia in West Africa,president charles \
Taylor. This letter is not meant to cajole your integrity or to lure your interest to \
unfamiliar ground rather it is to solicit your candid assistance to our entire family \
and at the same time forestalling a collosal didaster as a matter of fact. In the \
last fourteen months,three rebel factions headed by gen. sarkky thompson commander of \
the liberian peoples revolutionary front and his cohorts in arm, has waged a \
devastating war against the innocent people of liberia thereby leaving enomous \
casuality on the civilian populace.  
They want my husband who was democratically elected after many years of civil stife \
to vacate his office on the ground that he was a former war lord that ousted the \
regime of Samuel Doe,that he is not competent to run the affirs of the liberian \
people.Owing to this development,Our entire family has advised my husband to vacate \
and relinquish power for the interest of our people and peace in the entire nation \
for the good of our people,though it was pretty tough to convince him but the \
pressure mounted by the entire family and those of the global community including \
president George of United states of America and President Olusegun Obasanjo of \
Nigeria has of recent yielded a positive sign.Since the heat became intense since \
september 2001,we have been at the recieving end.  Now my husband has obliged to go \
into exile to nigeria on condition that I successfully carry out an instruction he \
has given to me and this is why I am making this contact to you.  I am writing you is \
to carry out his instruction which he has assured me is a gurrantee that he will \
leave office come october this year.He authorised me to source for a credible \
personality  with viable identity who will take custody of his resourses in cash and \
gold stocked at a safekeeping company in accra Ghana and in madrid Spain.He want me \
to do this as quickly as possible to enable him tender his resignation letter to the \
liberian parliament and to bow out honourably.  
It is for this reason I write this mail to you.Details of this transaction will be \
made available to you as soon as you have the interest to assist us. What exactly the \
family will offer you in percentage for this clarion call will be negotiated in due \
course. The most important thing is that i want my husband to leave office in no \
distant time than to engage the rebels in a fight to finish with the government troop \
who are equally men born by women like me. I will be gladly touched to hear your \
response a.s.a.p.,it will enable me make the next move about the safety of my \
children and the entire family for our general safety. Awaiting your response.
Mama prisca.Taylor.

I'm currently using hvr's testing cryptoAPI patches for 2.4.x, and I
have a block device encrypted with 256 bits serpent. This cannot be
correctly decrypted with linux-2.6.0-test2. Has something in the use
of serpent changed since then (or has block numbering changed again)?
Or should I go bug-hunting?

This is a multi-part message in MIME format

Dear Friend,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad =
necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing =
the sum of USD21,000.000 (twenty one million  dollars)inherited from my =
father's business reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He =
became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was =
victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was =
assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding =
the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the =
insecurity of both our lives and property then decided to deposit the above =
sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become =
the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt,and the =
farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's loyalists are bent =
on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% =
of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or =
25% share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.

if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed =
information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with =
utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax =
numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

DAVID CHANGA

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Added kernel side support for struct loop_info64 (2.5 kernels).
- loop.c-2.5.patched updated with fixes from 2.5.70-bk
- Modified Makefile to use /sbin/ absolute path for depmod and losetup.
- build-initrd.sh now supports /dev/md* and /dev/fd[01] devices
- build-initrd.sh now supports GnuPG files on removable device
- Added warning about unsupported devices to build-initrd.sh
- Dropped loop thread O(1) scheduler nice from -9 to -1 (2.4 and 2.5
  kernels). No change for kernels using old scheduler.
- Added lo_nice= module parameter for easier scheduler nice tuning (2.4 and
  2.5 kernels).
- Added 'AES-unhashed' encryption type which can be used to access ancient
  loop-AES-v1.0c disk images. Unhashed encryption type 'AES' (without
  numbers) may eventually vanish because it conflicts with kerneli.org
  syntax.
- Removed unused code from 'losetup -C' processing so that losetup and mount
  programs are now little bit smaller.

&gt; If I understood correctly, seeds are used to prevent dictionary attacks

Seed is used slow down dictionary attacks. It removes some optimzations that
could otherwise be used.

&gt; However, if somebody finds the correct seed, he could again calculate
&gt; the hashes on a different, very fast computer, couldn't he?

Yes he can. But without seed he can optimize the attack:

1)  Compute hash of one dictionary string.
2)  Encrypt one block (16 bytes) of known plaintext constant at specific
    location in file system.
3)  Save precomputed ciphertext + dictionary string in HUGE database.
    Database is kept sorted by ciphertext value.
4)  Repeat steps 1-3 for zillion dictionary strings.

Above precomputing can all be done in advance and needs to be done only
once.

Optimized dictionary attack:

1)  Read one block (16 bytes) of ciphertext from known plaintext location on
    the disk.
2)  Do binary search of above mentioned HUGE database.

When seeded passwords are used, bad guys can't spend 10 years precomputing
such databases. They know they have to start from scratch with every
different seed.

&gt; So how long does it take to calculate - let's say - one billion hashes?

If iteration count is set to value that takes 1 second of CPU time to do the
iteration, and assuming bad guys running the attack use same CPU but
optimized assembler implementation that is twice as fast, then it takes
about 500,000,000 seconds.

&gt; Do I really gain significant security improvement in using seeds?

Yes.

Cheers Jari. I suppose I should have guessed from the modprobe line, but I
didn't realise the loopaes boot would look for it. Thanks for your time.

Hi,

 

I'm a new comer and have several questions about loop-AES. 

 

1 what's the relationship between loop-AES and crypto-API? Is loop-AES a
part of crypto-API at present?

 

2 Since crypto-API has been merged into linux kernel 2.5.47, has
loop-AES been accepted by linux kernel?

 

3 Now can loop-AES encrypt a root filesystem?

 

I'll appreciate your kindly reply, thanks!

 

 

Forrest

Indeed. In my tar it's also the same as "tar -f-" or just "tar". But
"tar -O" != "tar -o". This is Unix: case matters.

&gt; Have gpg designed to encrypt ~Gigabytes of files from stdin without unsecure ~tmp

Try it and find out! However I would not want any gpg'ed files bigger
than a CD-R, for sake of easy manageability. Even that would be a bit
too much. I'd suggest breaking your data down into smaller archives.

Hi,

I wanted to try out loop-AES with kernel 2.4.20 (latest kernel in Debian
with the kernel-patch-xfs) but 6 hunks failed (loop.c 6, 14, 25, 27, 28,
29).

This is my first "patch experience" and I don't know how to continue from
here safely. Can I download a patch from kernel.org for loop.c apply it and
then loop-AES? Or must I wait till a kernel-source-2.4.21 and a new
kernel-patch-xfs package is available?

And while we are at it: Do I still need to patch util-linux? Version here
is 2.11z-1. (Can anyone give me a hint then, how to do it under Debian, so
that I get a new deb? Too sad there isn't a kernel-patch-loop-aes.)

Another question to Jari: I've seen loop-AES-v1.7d.tar.bz2 on
loop-aes.sourceforge.net but no announcement on this list. Did I miss
something or should still 1.7c be used?

Regards,
 Mike Dornberger

Dear All,

I have just switched to a new distro and wish to set up the same
encrypted root fs I had with Debian.

I am getting the following error when booting:

VFS: Mounted root (minix fs) readonly
Mounted /devfs on /dev
Freeing unsued kernel memory: 136k freed
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k ext2 errno=2
Mounting /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 as /lib failed

My relevant details are:
SuSE Linux 8.2
Kernel 2.4.21 (have not tried other kernels with this distro)
loop-AES 1.7d
Grub, devfs, /boot on hda1, / on hda2

BOOTDEV=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
BOOTTYPE=ext2
CRYPTROOT=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2

USEPIVOT=1
INITRDONLY=0
SOURCEROOT=
DESTINATIONROOT=
DESTINATIONPREFIX=/boot
INITRDGZNAME=initrd.gz

My root fs mounts ok from my rescue partition.

I never encountered these problems last time around. Any help (or insults if
I've missed something basic) gratefully received.

My encrypted /home/ mounts and works fine, but i can't fsck it.  I unmount 
it, and try fsck /dev/loop2 but i'm told there's no first or second 
superblock.  The /dev/loop2 loop still exists with definatly the correct 
password as i can remount it without being prompted for a password.

Its ext3 on a software raid5 looping through /dev/md0.  Am i fscking the 
wrong place? or, since it mounts ok still, should i copy the files off to 
another drive, recreate filesystem, then copy files back?

Thanks,
Brad.

Dear Friend,
I am Hajia  Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the wife of the late Nigerian Head of State who died \
on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services.  Following the sudden death of my \
husband, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown me into a \
state of utter confusion, frustration, and hopelessness. I have been subjected to \
inhuman, physical and physiological torture by the security agents in my country. My \
first son is still under detention, arraigned before the Federal High Court of \
Nigeria for an offence committed by his late father.  The incumbent civilian \
administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe of my late \
husbands activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign \
accounts together with other assets of my family as a retalia! tion for what my late \
husband did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria. \
As a matter of fact, we have been declare bankrupt and they are not relenting to make \
us poor for life. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with \
anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of \
my late husband have openly abandoned all my family.  MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. \
I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to \
reach you through this medium. You must have heard over the media reports and the \
Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late husband \
in different Banks and security firms abroad. Some of these banks and security firms \
willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian \
administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and \
monetary transactions with them. Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and \
I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have secretly deposited the sum of \
$22,000,000.00 with a security firm whose name is withheld for now until we open \
communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security \
Deposit Number 0090GM. For safety reason, the money was defaced and disguised before \
depositing it !  with the security company. I shall be grateful if you could receive \
this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you \
and my second son (Abbas) only. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for \
your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit \
with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney to enable you claim and receive \
this fund into your bank account. Please honesty is the watchword in this \
transaction. I am looking forward to your urgent positive response via my email \
:mariama64u@zwallet.com  Best regards, 
Hajia  Mrs. Mariam Abacha.

And your kernel logs recorded this message, viewable with "dmesg" command

    "Unable to get major number 7 for loop device"

Which means that your kernel has loop built-in.

&gt; &gt; If you recompiled a new kernel, you also need to boot that new kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I booted from the new Kernel. In the tree there is:
&gt; 
&gt; # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set
&gt; 
&gt; Should be correct or not?

Above "# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set" is correct, but you are not running
that kernel. Please post output of "uname -a" command.

If you run "cat /proc/devices" command, you will see loop device registered,
but "lsmod" command does not show loop module.

&gt; Can you help me please?

You are running some other loop driver, not the loop-AES' loop module. Above
"dd: writing `/dev/loop7': Input/output error" is a bug in mainline loop,
and fixed in loop-AES two years ago.

If you recompiled a new kernel, you also need to boot that new kernel.

Subject: Using crypto FS with RH 9


&gt; Hello
&gt; I have RH 9 and I see that the kernel has cryptoloop, cryptoapi and
&gt; cipher-aes modules available. After I insmod them, I try using losetup
&gt; with -e aes flag, but losetup says it is unsupported. Should I upgrade
&gt; losetup ? Or should I do something else ?
&gt;

Hi,
i updated my kernel to 2.4.21 and to mount my encrypted filesystems i
tried to compile my own loop_fish2.o with
ciphers-v1.0i.tar.bz2  or
ciphers-v1.1d.tar.bz2
and a patched loop.o with
loop-AES-v1.6i.tar.bz2 or 
loop-AES-v1.7d.tar.bz2,
but none of the cipher archives gave me a loop_fish2.o. i tried to do
an alias loop_fish2 loop_twofish, then he asked me for a passphrase,
but to mount the filsystem he was not able.
the hint for the ciphers and loop-AES files i got from
http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2002-12/msg00044.html

thank you

loop_twofish.o module can be used in SuSE compatible mode like this:

losetup -e twofish160 -H rmd160 -I 1 /dev/loop0 /dev/hda9
  or    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda9 /mnt9 -o loop,encryption=twofish160,phash=rmd160,loinit=1
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^

SuSE compatible mode is not the default, so SuSE compatibility needs to be
enabled with above underlined losetup/mount options.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

SuSE's losetup does not understand -H and -I options. Loop-AES' patched
version does. loop_twofish.o will not be SuSE compatible without the '-I 1'
option. Don't even try without it, otherwise you will corrupt your file
system.

SuSE's mount does not understand 'loinit' mount option. Loop-AES' patched
version does. loop_twofish.o will not be SuSE compatible without the
'loinit=1' mount option. Don't even try without it, otherwise you will
corrupt your file system.

Above "ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: invbalid argument" is probably result of
loop_twofish.o module not being loaded to kernel. It can be loaded using
"modprobe loop_twofish" command.

If you intend to use loop_twofish.o with SuSE encrypted partition, you need
to patch and recompile util-linux and install new losetup + mount binaries
as explained in loop-AES' README.

ATT; THE M.D. 
Dear Sir, 
Greetings to you and your family. I want you to read this mail with a compassionate \
heart and understanding that any action you take is geared towards rendering \
humanitarian assistance to a man who is in distress with his family. My name is \
Mr.Milton Debah, a Liberian and I served under President Charles Taylor. I was his \
right hand man until a couple of weeks ago when I realised that my entire life was in \
utmost danger after the assassination of the Sports Minister in a helicopter crash. I \
was responsible for the diamond deals with the RUF rebel group of Sierra Leone. I was \
handling the diamond sales on behalf of President Taylor who in turn supplies \
ammunition to the rebels. This is what the international community and United Nations \
code-named: Conflict Diamond.  It was while I was discharging this duty that I \
diverted the sum of US$ 30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States Dollars) for  \
myself. I deposited the money contained in 2 trunk boxes in a Security Company as \
artifacts to avoid prying eyes in Accra, Ghana and travelled back to my country where \
I continued with my duties. I informed President Taylor that the United Nations \
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSL) seized the diamond consignment and made report to \
the United Nations. It was based on this diamond dealings involving President Taylor \
that the United Nations imposed sanctions on  Liberia recently. 
My aim is to look for a trusted foreign partner outside to help me move the fund out \
for investment. It is based on my decision to move the fund out for investment that I \
am contacting you to assist me in taking the  funds to your country .All you need do \
is to fly down to claim the 2 Boxes from the Security Company and open a bank account \
through which the money will be lodged before transfer into your nominated  Bank \
account.  I am willing to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your \
assistance and want to let you understand that the future of myself and family \
depends solely on this money .In this transaction confidentiality is very essential \
for us to achieve our goal. It is importantthat you maintain utmost good faith and \
trust .You must  also not circumvent the transaction in any way. 
In conclusion I will like you to understand that you
shall bear no risk whatsoever in this business and as such there is nothing for you o \
be afraid of.  I await your swift response to this email. 

Milton Debah

On correctly set up box, umount detaches loop, so file system data won't be
there for fsck to find. If you have loop mount options defined in
/etc/fstab, do this:

umount /home
losetup -F /dev/loop2
fsck -t ext3 -f -y /dev/loop2
losetup -d /dev/loop2
mount /home

Hi, thanks for the reply.  Actually my loops are set on startup with an init 
script, so my fstab is plain except it uses /dev/loop2 instead of /dev/md0.  
I can happly mount and unmount it like an unencrypted drive.

If i start the system and log in as root, mount the partition, sync, is it 
ok to do a fsck on a mounted fs as no files are open?

This problem is most probably caused because the drives are never unmounted 
when the system shuts down, their always "busy" at the time.  I can prob fix 
that by looking into the shutdown script.s

Brad.

Then you should be able to fsck after unmount.

&gt; If i start the system and log in as root, mount the partition, sync, is it
&gt; ok to do a fsck on a mounted fs as no files are open?

Fsck'ing mounted partitions is not good idea. Read-only mounted root
partition gets fsck'ed at boot but that is special case.

&gt; This problem is most probably caused because the drives are never unmounted
&gt; when the system shuts down, their always "busy" at the time.  I can prob fix
&gt; that by looking into the shutdown script.s

But you said that fs type was ext3. fsck.ext3 should replay journal after
unclean shutdown, so this should not be a problem. Raid5 driver should also
tolerate unclean shutdowns.

Can you post exact commands that you use to set up raid5 and loop, as well
as fsck command that you used.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

Hi, sorry it took a while to reply, i had to wait till next reboot :)

Strangly enough, i did get fsck to work by deleting the loop, then 
re-running the S07losetup startup script again.

Like i said earlier, the loop still exists when i simply unmount as i can 
remount without password prompt, but fsck couldn't get a clue about the FS 
until loop was deleted and re-created.

The commands i used are correct as they worked fine now.  Its probably just 
another debian thing :\

s07losetup "echo "foopass" | losetup -p 0 -e AES256 /dev/loop2 /dev/md0

Another thing though, i've had no swapspace since the "2.4.19 or 2.4.20 
breaks encrypted swap" thread at the start of the year, has this been fixed 
now?  Does newest loop-aes fix it or must i use 2.4.21?

Thanks,
Brad.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Another question to Jari: I've seen loop-AES-v1.7d.tar.bz2 on
&gt; loop-aes.sourceforge.net but no announcement on this list. Did I miss

Ok, one should 'fetchmail' now and then. :)

&gt; I wanted to try out loop-AES with kernel 2.4.20 (latest kernel in Debian

&gt; 29).

Externally compiled module version should work with all stable kernels out
there. If someone can find a widely used kernel that does not work with
loop-AES' loop.o module, I definitely want to know about it.

&gt; This is my first "patch experience" and I don't know how to continue from
&gt; here safely. Can I download a patch from kernel.org for loop.c apply it and
&gt; then loop-AES? Or must I wait till a kernel-source-2.4.21 and a new
&gt; kernel-patch-xfs package is available?

Loop-AES' module build instructions are in the README file. No kernel
patching required.

&gt; And while we are at it: Do I still need to patch util-linux? Version here
&gt; is 2.11z-1. (Can anyone give me a hint then, how to do it under Debian, so
&gt; that I get a new deb? Too sad there isn't a kernel-patch-loop-aes.)

Last time I checked, debian included util-linux patch from kerneli.org. That
should work with loop-AES, but if you care about security, I recommend that
you set up seeded+iterated password. If kerneli.org/debian version does not
let you do that, you are better off installing more secure version from
loop-AES.

If I understood correctly, seeds are used to prevent dictionary attacks
with precomputed password hashes.

However, if somebody finds the correct seed, he could again calculate
the hashes on a different, very fast computer, couldn't he?

So how long does it take to calculate - let's say - one billion hashes?

Do I really gain significant security improvement in using seeds?

&gt; Strangly enough, i did get fsck to work by deleting the loop, then
&gt; re-running the S07losetup startup script again.

Sounds like some sort of miscompilation. Please post exact commands that you
used to configure, compile and install your kernel, as well as command that
you used to compile loop-AES' module.

&gt; Like i said earlier, the loop still exists when i simply unmount as i can
&gt; remount without password prompt, but fsck couldn't get a clue about the FS
&gt; until loop was deleted and re-created.

In my previous reply, I asked for you to disclose your exact fsck command
syntax that you used. Please post that. Otherwise you are just wasting my
time.

Please post output of these commands after you experience the fsck problem:

    tune2fs -l /dev/loop2
    losetup -a
    lsmod
    ls -l /etc/mtab
    dmesg
    uname -a

&gt; Another thing though, i've had no swapspace since the "2.4.19 or 2.4.20
&gt; breaks encrypted swap" thread at the start of the year, has this been fixed
&gt; now?  Does newest loop-aes fix it or must i use 2.4.21?

This problem is fixed in loop-AES-v1.7b and later versions.
v1.7b was released in January.

ATT; THE M.D. 
Dear Sir, 
Greetings to you and your family. I want you to read this mail with a compassionate \
heart and understanding that any action you take is geared towards rendering \
humanitarian assistance to a man who is in distress with his family. My name is \
Mr.Milton Obot, a Liberian and I served under President Charles Taylor. I was his \
right hand man until a couple of weeks ago when I realised that my entire life was in \
utmost danger after the assassination of the Sports Minister in a helicopter crash. I \
was responsible for the diamond deals with the RUF rebel group of Sierra Leone. I was \
handling the diamond sales on behalf of President Taylor who in turn supplies \
ammunition to the rebels. This is what the international community and United Nations \
code-named: Conflict Diamond.  It was while I was discharging this duty that I \
diverted the sum of US$ 30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States Dollars) for  \
myself. I deposited the money contained in 2 trunk boxes in a Security Company as \
artifacts to avoid prying eyes in Accra, Ghana and travelled back to my country where \
I continued with my duties. I informed President Taylor that the United Nations \
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSL) seized the diamond consignment and made report to \
the United Nations. It was based on this diamond dealings involving President Taylor \
that the United Nations imposed sanctions on  Liberia recently. 
My aim is to look for a trusted foreign partner outside to help me move the fund out \
for investment. It is based on my decision to move the fund out for investment that I \
am contacting you to assist me in taking the  funds to your country .All you need do \
is to fly down to claim the 2 Boxes from the Security Company and open a bank account \
through which the money will be lodged before transfer into your nominated  Bank \
account.  I am willing to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your \
assistance and want to let you understand that the future of myself and family \
depends solely on this money .In this transaction confidentiality is very essential \
for us to achieve our goal. It is importantthat you maintain utmost good faith and \
trust .You must  also not circumvent the transaction in any way. 
In conclusion I will like you to understand that you
shall bear no risk whatsoever in this business and as such there is nothing for you o \
be afraid of.  I await your swift response to this email. 

Milton Obot

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system

Hello!

I am attempting to set up an encrypted partition on my hard drive.  I'm running \
RedHat 9.0, with kernel 2.4.20-18.9, and I have the source RPM for this kernel \
installed.  

I downloaded loop-AES-v1.7d, unzipped and untarred it to /usr/local/src.  However, \
                when I try "make", I get the following:
-------------------------------------
[root@mail loop-AES-v1.7d]# make
cd /lib/modules/2.4.20-18.9/build &amp;&amp; make SUBDIRS=/usr/local/src/loop-AES-v1.7d \
modules Q='@cd /usr/local/src/loop-AES-v1.7d &amp;&amp; if [ "$@" = \
"/usr/local/src/loop-AES-v1.7d" ]; then make modules; fi &amp;&amp; true ' make[1]: Entering \
directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20-18.9'

The present kernel configuration has modules disabled.
Type 'make config' and enable loadable module support.
Then build a kernel with module support enabled.

make[1]: *** [modules] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20-18.9'
make: *** [all] Error 2
---------------------------------------

Now, I've checked, and it looks to me like the source is in the proper place, and I \
*think* modules are enabled, as I can use modprobe and insmod, and I have modules \
loading in /etc/modules.conf.  What am I missing?

Thanks!

Ben

&gt; &gt; I have RH 9 and I see that the kernel has cryptoloop, cryptoapi and
&gt; &gt; cipher-aes modules available. After I insmod them, I try using losetup
&gt; &gt; with -e aes flag, but losetup says it is unsupported. Should I upgrade
&gt; &gt; losetup ? Or should I do something else ?

Try this (Setting up an encrypted file system using CryptoAPI on RH9):

</body></email><email><emailId>20030624124925</emailId><senderName></senderName><senderEmail>frenchstylistics@gmx.li</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-06-24 12:49:25-0400</timestampReceived><subject>AW: Problem executing make test with loop-AES</subject><body>

&gt; You are running some other loop driver, not the loop-AES'
&gt; loop module. Above "dd: writing `/dev/loop7': Input/output error" is
&gt; a bug in mainline loop, and fixed in loop-AES two years ago.

Hm, as far as I can see, the loop.o is the new one compiled from
loop-AES:

galgnet:~ # dir /lib/modules/2.4.18-64GB-SMP/block/      
total 57
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           72 Jun 23 17:19 .
drwxr-xr-x    8 root     root          512 Jun 23 17:19 ..
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        54178 Jun 23 17:50 loop.o

Insmod tells me the following:

galgnet:~ # insmod /lib/modules/2.4.18-64GB-SMP/block/loop.o
/lib/modules/2.4.18-64GB-SMP/block/loop.o: init_module: Input/output
error
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters,
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters

&gt; If you recompiled a new kernel, you also need to boot that new kernel.

Yes, I booted from the new Kernel. In the tree there is:

# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set

Should be correct or not?

Thanks

Frank

&gt; And your kernel logs recorded this message, viewable with 
&gt; "dmesg" command
&gt; 
&gt;     "Unable to get major number 7 for loop device"
&gt; 
&gt; Which means that your kernel has loop built-in.

Thanks, that was the hint, forgot to run lilo correct to boot the
kernel. It works now.

Very good to know that there is a developer around who really knows,
what he is talking about! ;)

Tank you very much...

Frank

&gt; If you intend to use loop_twofish.o with SuSE encrypted partition, you need

I have not tested all combinations in following table, but this table
represents my understanding of SuSE twofish compatibility:

losetup + mount    kernel module    result    notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~    ~~~~~

from kerneli.org   cryptoloop       fails     2

notes:
1.  Fails because losetup and mount are not capable of putting kernel
    module to SuSE compatible mode.
2.  Fails because kernel module does not have SuSE compatible mode.
3.  Fails because losetup and mount do not support CryptoAPI.

&gt; recently i set up a crypted filesystem and use it already successfully.
&gt; for testing purposes (and 'cause i'm lazy) i've always used the option

&gt; 
&gt; losetup -k 128 -p 26 -e serpent /dev/loop6 /dev/sdb2
&gt; 
&gt; that way, i don't have to type in the passphrase manually, instead, as i
&gt; understood correctly, the passphrase is taken from the file located on
&gt; inode# 26.

Wrong! -p option reads password from _open_ file descriptor 26, where 0 is
stdin, 1 is stdout, 2 is stderr, and so on. Pointing -p option to unopen fd
is equivalent to empty password.

Maybe you intended to do something like this:

losetup -k 128 -p 3 -e serpent /dev/loop6 /dev/sdb2  3&lt;/path/to/some/file
               ^^^^                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt; root@sheep:~# losetup -k 128 -p 26 -e serpent /dev/loop6 /dev/sdb2
&gt; root@sheep:~# losetup /dev/loop6
&gt; /dev/loop6: [0805]:22698 (serpent-cbc) offset 0, undefined encryption
&gt; root@sheep:~#
&gt; 
&gt; (undefined encryption?)

undefined == CryptoAPI

it's good to hear things have improved.

&gt; Kerneli.org's loop-jari is a copy of old and buggy version of loop-AES' loop
&gt; code. Last time I checked, loop-jari had nasty 'process stuck in D state'
&gt; bug still present. That bug is fixed in loop-AES-v1.7b and later versions.

Ah, so it's really "loop-jari-old". :) I assumed that HVR was taking the
loop-jari patches directly from your loop-AES releases, but I suppose he
hasn't done it very recently.

Again in the "works for me" category, I'm running the swap encryption on
2.4.17, and the loop-jari patch I used was a year prior to that. I've
probably just been lucky. I'll have to build a new kernel there soon ...
but not before it hits 200 days' uptime next week. :)

BTW I used to have problems with processes stuck in D state; I didn't
think to ask about that here. I never really figured out the problem,
but IIRC it went away with 2.4.17. Before that I used 2.4.10. I think I
might have used swap encryption then. &lt;digging through /boot&gt; Yes, it
seems I was. I built the 2.4.10 on 2001/09/29, and the present 2.4.17 on
2002/03/28.

Thanks for the reply.

You did mention that your root partition is encrypted. There is a small
problem with encrypted root partition using initrd.gz created by
build-initrd.sh, because build-initrd.sh expects /sbin/insmod to work with
all kernels and accept currently used options. 2.4 and older kernels need
insmod from modutils package (maintained by Keith Owens), but 2.5 kernels
need insmod from module-init-tool package (maintained by Rusty Russell).
Insmod from module-init-tool package is still lacking behind badly. To work
around module-init-tool package deficiencies, you need to use new version of
build-initrd.sh with these options set:

USEPIVOT=1
SEPARATEMODULEDIR=1

New version is available from usual place:

http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/updates/loop-AES-v1.7c-20030519.diff.bz2
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/updates/loop-AES-v1.7c-20030519.diff.bz2.sign

Shame on Rusty for creating such incompatible package, shame on Linus for
accepting module code that depends on Rusty's incompatible package, and
shame on me for not testing build-initrd.sh with 2.5 kernels earlier.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

Dear Lee,


I am Barrister christopher Adams,(LLB)a solicitor at law with HURGAN AND ADAMS \
Associates and the personal attorney to Mr Frank Lee a citizen of your country, who \
used to work with shell development company in Nigeria. Herein after shall be \
referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 1999, my client,and his Ghana/African \
wife And their three children were involved in a car accident along agbama express \
road. 

All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made \
several enquiries through your embassy in Nigeria to locate any of my clients, \
extended relatives and this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several \
unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his surname over the nternet, to locate any \
member of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to  assist in \
repartrating the money and property left behind by my clien before they get \
confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were \
lodged.

Particularly,the Union bank plc where the deceased had an account valued at about \
12.5million dollars has issued me a notice as his attorney to provide the next of kin \
or have the account frozen within the next two official working months.


since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek \
your consent to present you as the next of kin of the eceased since you have the same \
surname so that the proceeds of this account valued at 12.5million dollars can be \
paid to you and then you and me  can share the money. 

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I \
guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect \
you from any breach of the law.

Hello, 

I'm trying to migrate my laptop to linux-2.5 now, 
since I have a lot of hope in the new acpi features. 
My (root) file system is loop-aes-encrypted, but
I cannot compile loop-aes-1.7c against 2.5.69:

patched-loop.c: In function 'loop_init_xfer':
warning: passwing arg 2 of pointer to function
from incompatible pointer type
patched-loop.c: In function 'loop_init':
warning: implicit declaration of function 
'devfs_register' 
patched-loop.c:1388: 'DEVFS_FL_DEFAULT' 
undeclared

As far as I can suspect there ware devfs changes, 
that loop-aes did not keep up to. Is this possible?
I tried to compile with and without devfs but it 
makes no difference.

Is there a chance to use loop-aes with 2.5.69?

TIA and Regards, 
Terje

&gt; More beneficial would be to comment on
&gt; util-linux-2.11z-crypto-v2.diff.bz2 patch working/not-working with kernel
&gt; 2.5.x cryptoloop. It was the only part I didn't test, because I didn't know
&gt; where working cryptoloop sources for 2.5.x kernels were, or if such code
&gt; existed at all.

Jaari:

Thanks for your excellent work on loop-AES, which has generated a lot of 
interest and excitement among the users of my favorite Linux 
distribution (Gentoo). http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=31363

I have been using the kerneli CryptoAPI on 2.4.19-20 kernels for about 
18 months, and now want to move to 2.5

I cannot get util-linux-2.11z (patched with crypto-v2.diff) to work with 
the CryptoAPI; I get "invalid ioctl" errors. (I am sorry this is not 
more specific -- I will get my system working again in a few hours and 
can reproduce the errors.)

So I thought that I would try the loop-AES versions of loop and 
loop_twofish.

I was encouraged by recent posts to this list, in which you indicate 
that loop-AES and util-linux should work with 2.5.69:
http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2003-05/msg00097.html

But I cannot get the build-initrd.sh script to work as expected.

I am able to use a the patches to create the kernel modules, and a 
patched losetup, and I am able to get things working from a command 
line. The initrd seems to load, but boots my unencrypted partition instead.

This may be an interaction with GRUB and devfs.

I feel that I should be able to debug this by looking more carefully at 
the build-initrd.sh script, and I will continue to do so.

Is anyone else using loop-AES to enable an encrypted root partition on 
the 2.5.69 development kernel?

Thanks!

I'm thinking of using the following on shutdown:

swapoff -a
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 bs=1024k count=64
sync
mkswap /dev/hda1
sync
swapon -a

(after checking that hda1 is swap ;).  Any comments or improvements?

Does anyone know if there is a recommended way of doing this under
Solaris? I guess you can do the same kind of thing, but because of the C2
rating there should be a way of automating this?

Maybe use shred instead of dd there. Overwriting swap once doesn't do such
a great job of destroying the data; if you assume that someone's going to
steal your computer and extract the hard drive then you should assume they
can get past that. ;-)

Or just use encrypted swap.

Nah. You must be under the impression that a C2 rating says something
meaningful about a system's overall security. It doesn't.

My thought was: mostly everyone can steal a hard drive and grep drives for
passwords/intereting data - virtually nobody can take an electron
microscope to the drive.

Yep, very true...

I thought C2 mandated object wiping before re-use, but I could be wrong...

If you are using loop-AES, just set up encrypted swap like this:

First, run "swapoff -a" to turn off swap devices in your /etc/fstab file.  
Second, add "loop=/dev/loop?" and "encryption=AES128" options to swap lines
in your /etc/fstab file. Example:

 /dev/hda666   none   swap   sw,loop=/dev/loop6,encryption=AES128   0   0  
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Third, run "swapon -a" and "rm -rf /var/log/ksymoops" and you are done.

Running "swapon -a" will set up loop devices using random keys, run mkswap
on them, and enable encrypted swap on specified loop devices. Usually your
distro's startup scripts will run the "swapon -a" command so you don't need
to change your startup scripts at all. As expected, "swapoff -a" will tear
down such loop devices.

Yes, more or less. I posted my swap encryption scripts in an offtopic
thread on alt.os.linux.slackware some time back.
  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=slrnaqh3lc.ef0.rob0%40linuxbox.stpaultel.com
I also brought it up on this list in 2001-September.

Both Jari and HVR recommend against using cryptoapi (kerneli) for swap.
But after all this time I can definitively say "it works for me". I have
over 6 months' uptime with significant swap usage on a P166. My
shutdowns in the time since working out the bugs have not been
attributable to swap problems. I believe I've seen it up over 100MB of
swap usage on 128MB physical RAM. The kernel is 2.4.17 plus the kerneli
patch and Jari's loop patch.

&gt; Any kernel Int cipher may be selected?

Yes.

Im running knoppix/debian and trying to  compile my own 2.4.20 kernel. After  
doing the usual patching of the vanilla kernel;

#cd /usr/src/linux
#zcat /home/david/downloads/patch-int-2.4.20.1.gz | patch -p1
#patch -p1 &lt; ~/loop-jari-2.4.20.0.patch
#bunzip2 /home/david/downloads/loop-AES-v1.7c.tar.bz2 | patch -p1
#tar xvf /home/david/downloads/loop-AES-v1.7c.tar | patch -p1

And build in all cryptoapi cryptoloop ciphers etc etc as modules

When I execute losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 ~/cryptfile I get;
" ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument"
It works if I use xor and the pre-built knopix/debian kernel works fine but 
any kernel (I've tried several) I build doesnt.  Im guessing its an issue 
with cipher-aes but I dont know.

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system

</body></email><email><emailId>20030526165047</emailId><senderName>Jari Ruusu</senderName><senderEmail>jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-05-26 16:50:47-0400</timestampReceived><subject>build-initrd.sh incompatible with cramfs</subject><body>

In private email, loop-AES user reported that he repeatedly experienced
problems booting encrypted root initrd.gz created with build-initrd.sh. It
turned out that his kernel was configured with cramfs built-in and that this
caused boot to fail. build-initrd.sh creates compressed minix file system on
the initrd. To cramfs, compressed minix file system appears to look like a
cramfs file system. When kernel attempts to detect initrd file system type,
cramfs detects it as cramfs type and attempts to mount compressed minix file
system as cramfs file system. Obviously, that can only fail.

Workaround for this incompatibility is to prevent cramfs code from ever
seeing compressed minix initrd. This can be accomplished in many ways,
including:

a)  Configure kernel with CONFIG_CRAMFS=n, or
b)  Configure kernel with CONFIG_CRAMFS=m, or
c)  Append "rootfstype=minix" kernel parameter. This works only
    when using USEPIVOT=1 in build-initrd.sh configuration.

Current version of loop-AES encrypted root instructions do not warn about
this incompatibility, so I decided to post this message here. Next version
of loop-AES will have this incompatibility properly documented.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

Hi,

I'm about to set up a file server with encrypted drives. I have an 
AlphaServer 800 w/500 MHz cpu and a Pentium II 400 MHz computer. Would 
it be better to use the Pentium with loop-AES because there's assembler 
code for newer x86 CPU's, or should I use the Alpha as the server?

Hi,
o.k. i'm not too familiar with linux yet. anyway i'm having problems to get
cryptoapi on a 2.4.18 kernel running. i tried to follow the
encryptionhowto.sourceforge.net howto for cryptoapi and patched the kernel (seemed to have
worked). Afterwards i was supposed to patch the util-linux 2.11z source. but in
the file i downloaded there was no patch. thus i loaded one (a 2.11r patch),
patched the utils (which didn't go to well). did configure and make (which
didn't do all). 
afterwards i tried to follow the instructions again. i did dd ... . finally
i ended up with:
root:# losetup -e AES /dev/loop1 /home/bs/work/bea1
Passwort:
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Das Argument ist ungültig (invalid argument)

so what's to do?
thanx for answering!!

Hi Jari,

well, i did download the loop-aes and i did unpack the utils-file again,
since i figuered, i'd need an unpatched one. Well after all the make command
didn't work quite right. 
Here is what i did. I tried to follow a german instruction site:
&lt;http://www.pl-forum.de/t_system/loop-aes.html&gt;

Doing this:

Going into the utils directory, patching the utils file: 

cat /path/to/Loop-AES/util-linux-2.xx.diff | patch -p1

cd util-linux-2.11z
./configure

configuring util-linux-2.11z

output:
You have &lt;scsi/scsi.h&gt;

make ADD_RAW=no
cd mount
install -m 4755 -o root mount umount /bin

there was no error message there. Then i went back to the
loop-aes-directory, did 

make clean
make

getting the following output:

So it all stops there.

I cannot seem to find any information on which is better. All I want is a good AES \
encrypt of my HD with at little overhead as possible. My Gentoo Linux OS natively \
runs the cryptoloop patch and so can use it without modification. To use loop-AES is \
a little more effort. 

Secondly. If I would like to encrypt an existing file system (ext3) can I go about it \
as such:

/dev/hdb1 is filled with data on ext3 fs and is currently not mounted. 

losetup -e aes256 /dev/loop1 /dev/hdb1
password: passwordhere

dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=/dev/loop1 bs=64k conv=notrun

I am not sure what the dd does, but it seems to do the encryption of the filesystem. \
Is this correct?

loop-AES automatically uses optimized assembler implementation of AES cipher
on modern x86 boxes, and it is about twice as fast as the C implementation
in cryptoapi+cryptoloop.

&gt; losetup -e aes256 /dev/loop1 /dev/hdb1
&gt; password: passwordhere

Yes it is correct, but you may want to use seeded password for better
security.

I have been using the cryptoapi implementation for more than a year with 
Gentoo and a 2.4.x kernel; I started with "crypto-sources" but now I 
think the cryptoloop is in the standard gentoo kernel...

 &gt; To use loop-AES is a little more effort.

There is now an ebuild for loop-aes, which may simplify things. Please 
take a look at the forum thread on this topic:
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=31363

I am working on integrating loop-aes with Gentoo and kernel 2.5.69. I 
have had more success in getting util-linux to work with the loop-AES 
implementation than with cryptoapi under the development kernel.


&gt; dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=/dev/loop1 bs=64k conv=notrun
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure what the dd does, but it seems to do the encryption
 &gt; of the filesystem. Is this correct?

The /dev/loop is performing the encryption of the filesystem. The "dd" 
command simply blasts bytes from the "input file" (if) to the "output 
file" (of), it does not know anything about encryption...

The loop-aes documentation (which is excellent, by the way) instructs 
you to download "aespipe" and use it to encrypt your system. I do not 
think this is necessary; I think that a dd command like yours is sufficient.

If the non-encrypted and the encrypted file systems are of different 
size (or type), then it might be even better to use a higher-level tool 
that lets the file system handle things. I create an encrypted disk 
partition, make a file system on it as usual, and then restore my data 
to the new encrypted partition with cpio.

Does this mean that I need to make a new partition for my data and afterward
restore it? Can I not just keep my ext3 partition and encrypt it without
backup/restore. 

Basically I got too much data on a few partitions that I cannot back them
up. Let's just say that I am constantly running the risk of loosing all this
data, but that's okay (I am  not trigger happy!). 

If there is no other way then I will have to buy another disk and do the
backup/restore bit.... 

Thanks for you're help so far!

Stian:

I am not certain, but I do not think you can perform in-place encryption 
of your data.

In any event, I would STRONGLY encourage you to purchase that disk and 
do the backup before attempting to experiment with block-level encryption!

Cheers!

program with boot floppy or CDROM. Statically linked aespipe program works
regardless of what kernel and C library user's boot floppy or CDROM happens
to include. It even works with FreeBSD if someone is inclined to do things
the hard way.

If you look at older loop-AES versions, they had encrypted root instructions
that used dd command directly on loop device. But to be able to do that,
people had to compile loop.o module for their boot floppy or CDROM kernel.
That wasn't always a painless exercise.

In-place encryption of partitions and disk images work just fine as long as
these requirement are met:

1)  File system must not be mounted at time of encryption
2)  Encryption is allowed to complete without interruptions (power loss
    renders file system partially encrypted and completely useless)

Got it... so you can use the aespipe program anywhere, so it's a good
candidate for putting on a rescue CD-ROM.

Can aespipe use alternate encryption ciphers? Since it is statically
linked, it seems to be AES-specific.

As always, thanks to Jaari for clarifying these points!

compile time if CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is enabled. You need to compile and
install new kernel. That leaves kernel sources in state that can be used to
compile kernel modules. Then you can successfully compile loop-AES module
for _that_ kernel.

O.k. this worked so far. Now it's all compiled pretty much after the
description in the README file of loop-aes. Now i created a container with

dd if=/dev/zero of=bea1 bs=60k count=1280

as user in a certein directory.

switched to root and did:

losetup -e AES256 -T /dev/loop1 ./bea1

and got:

Passwort:
Retype password:
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Das Argument ist ungültig (invalid argument)

Thus i'm back to my first problem ...

What now? In 2002 there was a similar question for cryptoapi on this list.
The answer was that in /proc/crypto the cipher was not found and has to be
installed. Well, /proc/crypto doesn't exist here. It needs something else. Any
idea?

Thanx for helping me

loop-AES does not need /proc/crypto. Please post output of the make command
that you used to compile loop.o module, as well as outputs of "uname -a",
"lsmod", and "ls -l /lib/modules" commands.

Above looked ok to me. Can you verify that you have

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n
CONFIG_KMOD=y

set in your kernel config.

Your loop-AES loop.o module seems to not load automatically. This can be
result of having loop built-in on your kernel or that module autoloading is
disabled. If above settings are not like that, you have to reconfigure and
recompile new kernel, and boot that new kernel. And recompile loop.o module
for that new kernel.

If "cat /proc/devices" shows loop device and loop module is not loaded, then
your kernel has loop built-in.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

If you want to test AES cipher speed, just compile and run included
userspace test program (save it as aes-test4.c). This test program needs
aes.c aes.h and aes-i586.S files from loop-AES-v1.7c tarball.

Compile command on P2:

    gcc -O2 -Wall -march=i686 aes-test4.c aes-i586.S -o aes-test4

Compile command on alpha:

    gcc -O2 -Wall aes-test4.c aes.c -o aes-test4

And then just run it on unloaded box like this:

    ./aes-test4

I just think i use the Pentium II as the file server. Even if I didn't 
used the assambler
version, it would still be bettet to use a Pentium II 400 MHz than a 
Alpha 500 MHz.


With 3 runs for each platfor in single user mode in Debian Unstable the 
results is as follow.

All results is in Mbits/sec

alp = Alpha 500 MHz CPU, c version of AES

kerneli.org version does not have 'encrypted swap' enabled swapon+swapoff.
At least not yet. Loop-AES versions of swapon+swapoff has been 'encrypted
swap' enabled for more than a year.

&gt; Yes, more or less. I posted my swap encryption scripts in an offtopic
&gt; thread on alt.os.linux.slackware some time back.
&gt;   http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=slrnaqh3lc.ef0.rob0%40linuxbox.stpaultel.com
&gt; I also brought it up on this list in 2001-September.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Jari and HVR recommend against using cryptoapi (kerneli) for swap.

I don't remember saying that, at least not for any recent version of
cryptoapi. And I doubt HVR would say that either. Non-prealloc versions of
loop are unsuitable for encrypted swap. loop-AES and kerneli.org's loop-jari
have preallocated pages for device backed loops.

Kerneli.org's loop-jari is a copy of old and buggy version of loop-AES' loop
code. Last time I checked, loop-jari had nasty 'process stuck in D state'
bug still present. That bug is fixed in loop-AES-v1.7b and later versions.
v1.7b was released in January 2003.

Yeah, I missed that. I handle the encryption only through losetup. The
keys are generated from /dev/urandom and are piped to losetup in my
scripts. Since I have 2 swap partitions I have "pri=1" in fstab options
to specify the priorities (equal, to distribute swap among both.) The
loop devices are listed in my fstab, not the underlying partitions; that
again is handled by losetup in my rc.local script.

So to answer the anonymous poster's query more fully: no, that type of
fstab entry will not work with the kerneli patch, but you can accomplish
the same thing using my scripts and "normal" fstab swap options. Thanks
again, Jari.

Sam, I think by now the original post in this thread has been beaten
pretty badly, but I had intended some days back to point you to a
discussion in comp.os.linux.security regarding "wiping" data from
magnetic media. It is conceivable that even attackers of modest means
could recover overwritten data, especially if overwritten with /dev/zero
putput.
  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=m3u1kvdtar.fsf%40mika.informatik.uni-freiburg.de
My proposal had been to use badblocks to overwrite the data, and the
above-referenced post explains why even that approach, whilst better
than /dev/zero, would not provide much more security.

"FBI" is mentioned numerous times in the thread as the threat model, but
see the Gutmann paper also mentioned:
  http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html
Not "light reading", but just go down to section 2. Gutmann suggested in
1996 that a powerful data recovery system could be built very cheaply:
  "If commercially-available SPM's are considered too expensive, it is
  possible to build a reasonably capable SPM for about US$1400, using
  a PC as a controller"
Consider as well that he was saying this in 1996, with more valuable
dollars buying more expensive computing equipment. It might be much
lower in cost now -- certainly on much more powerful processors.

Suppose an attacker seizes physical control of your system before a
normal shutdown: your swap is readable. That's a low-tech, yet very
effective, attack. No matter what your threat model, I'd recommend that
you encrypt rather than wipe your swap devices.

From: Kissoon Soobaste
1st Floor Britam Building,
25 Pope Hennessy Street,
Port Louis, Mauritius. 

Dear Friend,

Subject: Account No.: 20100001050 in my bank belonging to Frederick Morris 

I want to transfer to you the total sum of Twenty-One Million, Four Hundred and \
Fifty-five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ten United States Dollars (US$21,455,910.00) \
from here in Mauritius. I hope you will be reliable and honest and will be capable \
and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account \
immediately to receive this money. I sincerely wish you would remain honest to me \
till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you \
will never let me down either now or in time to come. I am Kissoon Soobaste, the \
Financial Officer of a Bank and my International Passport attached to this mail \
identifies me more. During the course of my duty, I discovered a floating fund in an \
account opened in the bank in 1996 but since April 2000 nobody has operated on this \
account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that \
the owner of the account had died. I also found out that the heir to the funds were \
his wife.  Further investigations privately done by me proved that the owner of this \
account who is a foreigner and a sailor, died on the 15th of June 2000, together with \
his wife and their little daughter in a ghastly car accident along Guy Seaport Road, \
Souillac, Mauritius. All occupants of the vehicle including their driver \
unfortunately lost their lives. The wife was the heir to this account and my findings \
lead me to know that no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning \
it since the account has no other beneficiary as next of kin except the wife (heir) \
who died along with him. Since April 2000 therefore, the money has been floating \
which means that if nobody puts up a claim soon, and the allowed/permitted funds \
floating period elapses, the money will be confiscated by the bank, and be referred \
to as unclaimed bills. Thus it will be forfeited for nothing to nobody’s \
advantage except to the bank. This is the usual case in similar situations in which \
account holders’ die without any specific beneficiary (heir or next of kin \
specified in their account opening form). Consequently, I want to present you as the \
next of kin and ensure this money is remitted out urgently to you into the account \
you will provide. While the total amount involved is US$21,455,910.00 only, if you \
are interested in this business I will start the first money transfer with US $ \
7,151,970.00 upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you. We \
shall also re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount similarly to your \
account.  I am only contacting you as a foreigner because the former owner of the \
account is a foreigner and it is logical that the next of kin (that I will present \
you as) who applies to claim the money be a foreigner with foreign credentials and \
foreign account since this sum is in U.S. dollars and could only be approved into a \
foreign account. Meanwhile it is necessary you know that my attempts to contact or \
locate any relations/family members proved unsuccessful hence I decided to contact \
you. I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding \
agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of \
your choice where the fund will be safe. I need your strong assurance that you will \
never let me down because I am ready to ensure that all necessary documents and steps \
needed to get the money transferred into your account are perfected legitimately. I \
will apply for annual leave immediately the funds are secured in your custody. Once \
more, I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward \
transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant \
ministries, foreign exchange departments, embassy and Board of Internal Revenue \
Services here in Mauritius. I will inform you the next step to take immediately you \
reply me positively and give me full assurance that you will cooperate and work with \
me with honesty. At the conclusion of this business, you will have 35% of the total \
amount. I look forward to your earliest reply to my private e- mail \
address:kisson_s@hknetmail.com Yours truly,
Kissoon Soobaste.

This is a multi-part message in MIME format

Good day,
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know
me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am FREDERICK SILUMA
the first son of ZHIRI SILUMA ,a farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you.
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit
the sum of US4.5 million (Four  million, Five Hundred thousand United
States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones
to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for
the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment
of new farms in Swaziland.
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob
action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In
fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which
my father was one of the victims.
It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear
of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are
seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father^=D2s
money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be
involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could
be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on
taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be
playing along with them.
I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South
Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both
countries have similar political history. As a businessman,I am seeking
for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you
accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make
an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds)
from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given
directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South
Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like
change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I
intend to use for investment.
through my private E-mail address fredericksiluma@netscape.net
 while I implore you to maintain the absolute
secrecy required in this transaction.
Thanks
Yours Faithfully
FREDERICK SILUMA

If you built cryptoloop+cryptoapi as modules, just make sure you have
necessary modules loaded.

&gt; But I cannot get the build-initrd.sh script to work as expected.
&gt; 
&gt; I am able to use a the patches to create the kernel modules, and a
&gt; patched losetup, and I am able to get things working from a command
&gt; line. The initrd seems to load, but boots my unencrypted partition instead.
&gt; 
&gt; This may be an interaction with GRUB and devfs.

GRUB + devfs combination needs special care. Carefully read comments on the
beginning of build-initrd.sh script, it should be explained there. I only
tested GRUB + devfs combination on 2.4 kernels.

&gt; To cramfs, compressed minix file system appears to look like a

&gt; cramfs detects it as cramfs type and attempts to mount compressed minix file
&gt; system as cramfs file system. Obviously, that can only fail.

I ran into a similar problem with UDF, the filesystem for DVDs and some 
CD-ROMs. This might be incorporated into the kernel by default -- in the 
2.5.x kernels it's listed under "CD-ROM" filesystems. Forcing it to 
build as a module fixed this problem.

Hi guys,

I've been using CFS over NFS with ext2/3 without
any problems, i.e., the container file is on an nfs-mounted
file system.  Recently I had to switch on one server
from NFS to SMB. After a few minutes the crypt file system
got corrupted and access to the mounted file system just hang.
I tried starting from scratch with doing losetup and mkfs on the
crypto file system, but it always hangs after writting 
about 265 inodes. I tried using ext2 with various block sizes
including using the same block size for smbmount and for
the filesystem. No success. There are usually no errors
on the server or the client ... it just hangs.

I'm using Debian Linux w/ kernel 2.4.19 (patch-int-2.4.18.3),
cryptoapi 0.1.0-pre4, CFS 1.4.1, and smbfs 2.999+3.0.alpha20.


I would appreciate any comments you may have?

ciao...

&gt; I just think i use the Pentium II as the file server. Even if I didn't 
&gt; used the assambler
&gt; version, it would still be bettet to use a Pentium II 400 MHz than a 
&gt; Alpha 500 MHz.

Alphas however do have a large coolness factor. Maybe it's worth to
build an Alpha assembler version of this... Personally, I prefer older
workstations (not only Alpha but also Sparc, parisc, ...) over
PeeCees...

&gt; &gt; That's it. I hope it's enough information at first.  So far i havn't the
&gt; &gt; faintest idea, where to look. thanx for helping
&gt; 
&gt; Above looked ok to me. Can you verify that you have
&gt; 
&gt; CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n
&gt; CONFIG_KMOD=y
&gt; 
&gt; set in your kernel config.
&gt; 
&gt; Your loop-AES loop.o module seems to not load automatically. This can be
&gt; result of having loop built-in on your kernel or that module autoloading is
&gt; disabled. If above settings are not like that, you have to reconfigure and
&gt; recompile new kernel, and boot that new kernel. And recompile loop.o module
&gt; for that new kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; If "cat /proc/devices" shows loop device and loop module is not loaded, then
&gt; your kernel has loop built-in.

Correction: Your running kernel was built on Wed Mar 27 13:57:05 UTC 2002.
You are running wrong kernel, not the one loop.o module was compiled for.

I ran some tests for HVR a year or two ago and did just that with
cryptoapi. Worked fine. You can also re-encrypt to change the password
if it has been compromised.

It is, however, risky: Bump the power cord before the rewrite is
complete and your data is toast.

&gt; 
&gt; so I guess Ill try it with the swap device first to try or somthing
&gt; 
&gt; So it is no risk if the crypted device is disabled and I resize ?

Loop device will adapt to size of underlying device when loop is setup.
Backing up 430 GB is not going to be fun, but I still recommend that you
backup your data before resize.

If you are expanding swap partition, be sure to run 'swapoff' and 'mkswap'
on the expanded device before using it with 'swapon'. IIRC, size of swap
partition is recorded at beginning of swap partition and 'mkswap' will write
new size there.

sadly they do get money from these scams.  What they also do is look forward
to unsubscribe requests - then they know they have a good, working, email
address and can add it to other lists - so don't reply to them :)

Subject: Re: A CRY FOR HELP


  I am requesting that you remove my name from your email list.  I have
received these ridiculous pleas from your country over the past year (if
indeed you really are in Nigeria) and have forwarded them to our security
authorities.  Do you really get money from people with these ploys?  Sorry,
I'm not among the stupid elite!

soundtrack.&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
                          &lt;/table&gt;
                           &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                          &lt;b&gt;Crop Circles: Quest For Truth&lt;/b&gt; is an astonishing
                          experience guaranteed to shift perspectives and alter \
perceptions of what is real!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                          &lt;b&gt;Of the 100-180 or so formations that have appeared&lt;/b&gt; \
                in southern England
                          every summer for the past 12 years, it is highly doubtful \
                that more than a
                          few were surreptitiously and secretly manmade - the facts \
                don't add up for
                          anything more than a handful of convincing fakes in any \
                given year. That
                          leaves a huge, unexplained and authentic phenomenon.
                          My assertion, which is absolutely 100% certain and \
                unabashed, is that in
                          fact there are hundreds if not thousands of authentic Crop \
                Circles that
                          have appeared in the past somewhere in the world.
                          &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are real!&lt;/b&gt;

"Tener, Stuart B., IT3 , USNR-R" wrote:
&gt;         Starting from the presumtption that your code is less buggy as
&gt; well as faster, would you now consider doing a kernel implementation of
&gt; it since the Linux kernel is now going to support encryption?

Loop-AES is a kernel implementation. If you meant kernel patch version, look
for kernel-2.4.*.diff in the tarball.

&gt;         The reason I see for it is that if you wish to do encrypted
&gt; boot/root, or have raid volumes mounted on boot-up be encrypted the
&gt; kernel version will do this much more easily than using loop devices and
&gt; provide a smoother form of implementation. I also believe the advantages
&gt; of your code (if inclusive) to the kernel would be allowing Linux to
&gt; leverage your code for other places where it needs to apply encryptive
&gt; technology (network traffic encryption?).

Do you realize how many different kernels people use? If you want to provide
tens (hundreds?) different patches for all of those kernels, feel free to do
so. Loop-AES' solution is to provide one kernel patch version that works
with latest stable mainline kernel and externally compiled module version
that works with just about any maintained stable kernel out there.

Loop-AES supports encrypted root even if loop is compiled as module. See
loop-AES' README and build-initrd.sh for more details.

&gt;         The other question I have is, if RedHat was desirous of
&gt; embedding your loop-AES package within their distribution how would you
&gt; feel about that?

Red Hat people know where loop-AES' source is. Merging that to their distro
is their decision. As of this writing, my plan is to support Red Hat kernels
no matter what crap they merge to their kernels.

Hi,

I run gentoo 1.4RC2 with a 430 GB Volume with EVMS and crypted with 
AES256  version 1.7b.

It is a Hardware raid5 (3ware). Now I want to add another HD, expand the 
RAID5 and expand the partition via EVMS and then expand the XFS 
Filesystem. I wonder if I will get problems because the partition is a 
loop AES256 partition ?

Im kinda scared I might loose data :-)

thx for any help

Chris

Crypotechs:

	I am curious, I recently downloaded and installed the new RH 9.0
Linux and noticed that the 2.4.20-8 kernel supplied with RH 9 has a
crypto library in it.

	Has any effort been made to interface this with Loop-aes or the
kernel patch?

That Red Hat kernel includes cryptoapi + HVR's loop patch. Loop-AES'
replacement loop is twice as fast and significantly less buggy than the one
in 2.4.20-8 Red Hat kernel. Answer to your quiestion: Interfacing to slower
and more buggier code just does not make sense.

Mr. Ruusu:

	Starting from the presumtption that your code is less buggy as
well as faster, would you now consider doing a kernel implementation of
it since the Linux kernel is now going to support encryption?

	Why do this you may ask?

	The reason I see for it is that if you wish to do encrypted
boot/root, or have raid volumes mounted on boot-up be encrypted the
kernel version will do this much more easily than using loop devices and
provide a smoother form of implementation. I also believe the advantages
of your code (if inclusive) to the kernel would be allowing Linux to
leverage your code for other places where it needs to apply encryptive
technology (network traffic encryption?).

	How do you see this issue in view of your code?

	The other question I have is, if RedHat was desirous of
embedding your loop-AES package within their distribution how would you
feel about that?

Resizing of loop devices while they are active is not supported. If your
setup is:

    XFS filesystem -&gt; loop -&gt; EVMS -&gt; raid5 disks

Then resizing may succeed if you do:

    1) Unmount your XFS filesystem
    2) Detach loop device with 'losetup -d ....'
    3) Do EVMS magic to expand size
    4) Setup loop device again to expanded device
    5) Mount your XFS filesystem
    6) Resize your XFS filesystem

Steps 2 and 4 are not necessary if you have
'loop=/dev/loop?,encryption=AES256' mount options in your /etc/fstab.

Jari Ruusu &lt;jari.ruusu@pp.inet.fi&gt;

ok, I have this in fstab:

/dev/evms/store         /store          xfs 
defaults,noatime,noauto,loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES256 0 0

Yes I got

XFS filesystem -&gt; loop -&gt; EVMS -&gt; raid5 disks

so I guess Ill try it with the swap device first to try or somthing

So it is no risk if the crypted device is disabled and I resize ?

thx alot

thx alot

&lt;STYLE&gt;TABLE.mail_content {DISPLAY: block}&lt;/STYLE&gt;&lt;TABLE width="440" height="300" \
Class="mail_content" ALIGN="CENTER"&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD VALIGN="TOP" \
style="position:relative;"&gt;&lt;div&gt;FROM THE DESK OF MR.JOSEPH SANTOSS.&lt;BR&gt;BILL AND \
EXCHANGE MANAGER, &lt;BR&gt;STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC,&lt;BR&gt;LAGOS NIGERIA.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sir, \
&lt;BR&gt;I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of \
&lt;BR&gt;Standard Trust Bank Plc. I am writing following the impressive information about \
&lt;BR&gt;you through the internet .&lt;BR&gt;In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of \
US$ 20.5m US dollars &lt;BR&gt;twenty million, five hundred thousand US dollars) . In an \
account that belongs to &lt;BR&gt;one of our foreign customer who died along with his \
entire family in a fatal plane &lt;BR&gt;crash in the year 2000. Since we got information \
about his death, we have been &lt;BR&gt;expecting his next of kin to come over and claim \
his money because we cannot &lt;BR&gt;release it unless somebody applies for it as next of \
kin or relation to the   deceased &lt;BR&gt;as indicated in our banking guidelines but \
unfortunately we learnt that his &lt;BR&gt;supposed next of kin or relation died alongside \
with him at the plane crash leaving &lt;BR&gt;nobody behind for the claim. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is \
therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now \
&lt;BR&gt;decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as \
&lt;BR&gt;the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \
&lt;BR&gt;disbursement &lt;BR&gt;since nobody is coming for it and we don?t want this money to go \
into the Bank &lt;BR&gt;treasury as unclaimed Bill. &lt;BR&gt;The Banking law and guideline here \
stipulates that if such money remained &lt;BR&gt;unclamed after four years, the money will \
be transfered into the Bank treasury &lt;BR&gt;account as unclaimed fund. &lt;BR&gt;The request \
of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact &lt;BR&gt;that the \
customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of kin to a \
&lt;BR&gt;foreigner. &lt;BR&gt;We agree that   30 % of this money will be for you as foreign \
partner, in respect to &lt;BR&gt;the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside \
for expenses incured &lt;BR&gt;during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \
colleagues. There after I &lt;BR&gt;and my colleagues will visit your country for \
disbursement accoding to the &lt;BR&gt;percentages indicated. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Therefore to enable \
the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you &lt;BR&gt;must apply first to \
the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating &lt;BR&gt;your bank name, \
your bank account number, your private telephone and fax &lt;BR&gt;number for easy and \
effective communication and location where in the money will &lt;BR&gt;be remitted . \
&lt;BR&gt;Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the \
&lt;BR&gt;application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is \
hitch free &lt;BR&gt;and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \
arrangements &lt;BR&gt;have been made for the tran  sfer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You should contact me \
immediately as soon as you receive this letter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Trusting to hear from you \
immediately. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your?s faithfully, &lt;BR&gt;MR.JOSEPH SANTOSS.&lt;BR&gt;Bill and exchange \
manager, &lt;BR&gt;STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC. &lt;BR&gt;N.B.my intention of writing you through \
email is because i belive it is very &lt;BR&gt;confidential. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a \

Hello linux-crypto@nl.linux.org:

Thank you for registering for a Microsoft® .NET Passport at a participating Web site. \


Use the e-mail address (linux-crypto@nl.linux.org) and password you provided during \
registration to sign in instantly at any .NET Passport-enabled Web site that displays \
the .NET Passport sign-in button. 

The rest of this e-mail message contains important information about how to use your \
.NET Passport. You may want to refer back to it on occasion, so please save it or \
print a copy.

TO SIGN IN AND SIGN OUT AT A .NET PASSPORT-ENABLED SITE

TO SIGN IN, click the .NET Passport sign-in button on the site, and then type your \
e-mail address and password in the sign-in box that appears. 

After you sign in to one .NET Passport-enabled site, you can sign in to any other \
just by clicking the .NET Passport sign-in button on each site. 

TO SIGN OUT, click the .NET Passport sign-out button on the site. Clicking this \
button at any site will sign you out of all .NET Passport-enabled sites.

&gt; &gt; It may work if you do it as loadable modules, which is

&gt; &gt; modules. It's temporarily broken for my needs though.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried loadable modules. It did not work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I presume you are using either a debian util-linux or
&gt; 
&gt; debian, right.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've been too busy to attack this: I've just stuck with
&gt; &gt; the older patches... but I'm looking into it on the 
&gt; &gt; developer list now as it has not been fixed six months
&gt; &gt; on.
&gt; 

I still have no response from anyone in the cryptoapi
developer group. However, if you are still having problems,
I have confirmed an April 2002 patch set that does not
exhibit this problem. It takes manual patching to get
it to work with 2.4.20 (and if you are using arm, or
a couple other non-i385 architectures it fails), but
I've been able to get working crypto kernels that way.

I have been completely unable to get the current cvs
tree patches to work. I have no idea what is wrong
with them, or more likely, what is missing from the
documentation about what has been changed.

Let me know if you'd like the old set.

Your daily humor:

A woman went to her doctor for advice. She told the physician that her
husband had developed a penchant for anal sex, and she wasn't sure it
was such a good idea.
   
The Doctor asked, "Do you enjoy it?"
   
She said that she did.
   
He asked, "Does it hurt you?"
   
She said no.
   
The Doctor then told her, "Well, then, there's no reason that you
shouldn't practice anal sex, if that's what you like, so long as you
take care not to get pregnant."
   
The woman was mystified. She asked, "You can get pregnant from anal
sex?"
   
The Doctor replied, "Of course. Where do you think lawyers come from?"

&gt; 1) Where is the password stored that you type in upon
&gt; running losetup?

The password isn't actually stored anywhere. It (or rather a hash of it which 
is kept in RAM while the loop device is in use) is just used to encrypt and 
decrypt the data in the file. If the wrong password is entered, no error will 
occur and data will still be returned by the loop device, but it'll be 
meaningless.

&gt; 2) The reason I ask is that I would like to use an
&gt; encrypted filesystem across the network. If i set
&gt; everything up on MACHINE1, how would I connect to it
&gt; across the network? Create a traditional samba mount
&gt; so that my local MACHINE2 can access the encrypted
&gt; file/system "cryptofile" and then setup another
&gt; loopback on the local MACHINE2?

I think you'd have to share the mounted crypto-filesystem, rather than the 
cryptofile containing it. Only one client would be able to use the cryptofile 
at a time if you shared the file and tried to set up loop devices on each 
client. Of course, if you were only going to access the fs on one client at a 
time, you could probably set up a loop device over the network. I'm not sure 
how well it works, though. The last time I tried using a loop over NFS, it 
panicked my system (but that was quite a while ago).

&gt; 3) I guess what I'm wondering is what will happen with
&gt; the passwords. What happens if I take the giant file
&gt; that I use to store all the encrypted materials,
&gt; "cryptofile" and move it to another MACHINE3 and try
&gt; to use it?

You should have no problem using it on any machine with the appropriate crypto 
code installed.

Looks like something trashes bit 5 of RAM page at address 0x?????FD9. Such
one bit errors of encrypted data always cause one 16 byte block to decrypt
to garbage, plus one bit error in the next 16 byte block because of cipher
block chaining. All of the "cmp -l ..." dumps show exactly same pattern.

May I suggest that you run memtest86 for 24 hours on that box. Last time I
looked (it has been a while), memtest86 was available at:

I worked with HVR last night to find out what the problem
was, and it was... simple. It turns out the cvs store
split the patches into cryptoapi and cryptoloop and I
had not been aware of this. It seems I was not the only
one caught out by this as there have been several
queries that appeared to have the identical problem
to mine.

Unfortuneately, the cvs store is a working one and
is not necessarily stable, so even after this great
AHA! I still got an "oh crap" when the compile failed.

But never fear. HVR has been keeping up a set of pure 
patches for each 2.4.x release which are in testing which
is probably why so many have missed them.

So here is how I build it (Note: if you can use either
the iv patch or the jari patch but not both):

wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/testing/patch-int-2.4.20.1.bz2
wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/testing/loop-jari-2.4.20.0.patch
tar jxf linux-2.4.20.tar.bz2
ln -s linux-2.4.20 linux
cd linux
bzcat ../patch-int-2.4.20.1.bz2 | patch -p1
patch -p1 &lt; ../loop-jari-2.4.20.0.patch
cp -a ../previous-2.4.18jfd.config .config
make oldconfig
make menuconfig
	# select crypto, assorted cipher &amp; hash, and 
	# cryptoloop options
make dep; make bzImage
cp -a System.map /boot/System.map-2.4.20ij 
cp -a arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20ij
zile /etc/lilo.conf
lilo
reboot

	TIME PASSES...

losetup -e aes /dev/loop2 /usr/src/test.ext2
Available keysizes (bits): 128 192 256 
Keysize: 256
Password :
mount /dev/loop2 /mnt
ls /mnt
foo1  lost+found

I hope this gets everyone else sorted out as well.

&gt; 1. am I going to need a patched losetup? The one on mandrake 9.
&gt; doesn't seem to like the -I option.
&gt; The one that comes with Mandrake 9 is;
&gt; losetup-2.11u-1mdk

That version is intended to be used with loop-AES versions v1.7b or later,
but it should work ok with older versions too. Some losetup/mount options
may be missing from Mandrake shipped losetup/mount. "make tests" requires -I
option so that will not work with that Mandrake losetup. OK, so don't run
"make tests", or apply included patch and then run "make tests".

&gt; 2. I don't think that running 'make' should do any installation
&gt; work... 'make install' after 'make' is preferable.

Yes, "make install" would be better. However, there was a problem getting
all supported kernel Makefiles to jump back to build directory with correct
make definitions. If I remember correctly, 2.2.x kernels were the troubled
ones. It made more sense to make all behave the same way.

Yes.

&gt; if i use "losetup -e AES -S xxxxxx&lt;-N-&gt;xxxxxxx" (meaning N characters for
&gt; seed) and then password with M characters, will the AES crypt bit size be
&gt; determined by N, by M or somehow by their combination ? Or which ever is
&gt; greater / smaller will determine the crypt bit size ?

For loop-AES' obsolete encryption type AES (without numbers), number of bits
used for encryption is determined by length of M+N:

  128 bit encryption is used for M+N of less than 32
  192 bit encryption is used for M+N of 32...42
  256 bit encryption is used for M+N of more than 42

Loop-AES obsolete encryption type AES (without numbers) exists only for
backward compatibility with some old version. For new setups, _please_ use
AES128, AES192 or AES256 encryption type. Due to creation of unified
(loop-AES + kerneli.org) util-linux, loop-AES' obsolete encryption type
'AES' (without numbers) may be renamed to 'AES-unhashed' in future, so
please avoid using it.

FROM:DR.ABDULKARIM AFOLABI
CHIEF FINANCIAL DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL
COMMISSION (INEC)
LAGOS NIGERIA

ATTENTION:-

It is my warmest pleasure writing you this onfidential business offer
irrespective of the fact that we have not met before or done any thing
that will re-impose absolute confidence but nevertheless,an adage says 
a day begins a story and it is in line of this strong perspective that 
I am very determined to communicate you with much conviction that you 
will give my proposal a second thought and consideration.

As earlier stated I am Dr.ABDULKARIM AFOLABI, a financial director working
with Inec. My Agency is in charge of conducting all elections in my
country Nigeria and by the virtue of my unique position in office as 
the Chief financial director. I was elevated by the commission to become 
the chairman of foreign contract tender board committee whose 
responsibility is to award and supervise foreign contract to ensure it is 
executed promptly.

Consequently, I the chairman of the tender board committee in
collaboration with two other top committee members over- invoice 
certain contract for the supply of electoral equipments needed for the 
forth-coming elections approaching around APRIL 2003. The initial cost of 
the contract was pegged at US$50 million, but after the feasibility study 
was done, while submitting my report to the office of the presidency, we 
deliberately inflated the cost to an excess amount  of US$ 30 million making the 
cost to be US$ 80 million.

Right now, the gist of contacting you is, we are constrained to claim
the fund due to certain laws enacted by the government guiding civil
service code of conduct Bureau which prohibits top civil servants 
working under Government establishment from operating offshore or foreign 
Account and this situation has kept us in a fix to openly come forward to 
claim the outstanding balance of US$30 million, hence after series of 
private meetings we decided to make contact in order to get a reliable 
foreign partner whom we will forward his or her credentials to claim the 
fund based on mutual trust
and,agreement.

In a nutshell, we need your assistance and support to claim this fund
so that at the later time convenient for us, we will come over to your
country after the funds have been transferred to meet you and collect 
our own percentage while you will keep the rest as yours. For your 
support and total dedication to realize the objectives of this operation, 
you shall be entitled to 25% of the sum total, 5% for misslaneous expense 
like telephone bill, while 70% of the fund belongs to the three 
officials involved in the deal. 

Note, you are vividly assured that you will not be subjected to any
kind of risk for your support and involvement in this venture hence we
have piloted a good strategy to ensure the operations goes smoothly of 
which we have targeted two weeks duration to accomplished our aim. 
Kindly treat this matter Absolutely confidential because the officials 
involved are still in service and some of us intend to
resign our appointment immediately after the Transaction is finalized.

I look forward to hearing positively from you while further details
will be given as soon as I get your response.

Best Regards

DR.ABDULKARIM AFOLABI,
(CHAIRMAN TENDER BOARD COMMITTEE)

</body></email><email><emailId>20030315043347</emailId><senderName>"Steve Wray"</senderName><senderEmail>steve.wray@paradise.net.nz</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-03-15 04:33:47-0400</timestampReceived><subject>huge problems with cryptoloop...</subject><body>

Hi there,
I've been trying to integrate the crypto patches
with the Mandrake kernel src rpm.

However, even though make menuconfig shows the
selection option for cryptoloop, and I select it,
it doesn't get compiled.

- All rejects have been accounted for and merged.
There was only one; the main Makefile.

- I used the  CryptoAPI Magic Installer

- I also tried manually patching with
	make patch-kernel from the unpacked cryptoapi
directory and the unpacked cryptoloop directory.

- I tried using anonymous cvs to get the latest
cryptoloop source tree; the patching process against
the 2.4.19 kernel doesn't work; can't find a file.
Seems to be a bug in the findpatch.pl script?
I'm not a perl programmer but it seems to have the
wrong -p level?

Interestingly,
'make modules' from the cryptoloop directory tries
to patch the kernel source tree; I thought it was
supposed to compile the modules only in the cryptoloop
directory and leave the main kernel source tree alone?

I've also tried patching a pristine 2.4.19 kernel source
tree using the 'magic installer' and it wouldn't compile
the cryptoloop module either, though once again, the
configure option was there, was selected, and inspection
of .config shows it selected.
The compile process didn't even touch the relevent sections
of the source tree.
So I downloaded the 'magic installer' script and inspected
it; the section on the cryptoloop module appears to be
disabled?

Is cryptoloop temporarily broken?

Thanks!

Since you appear to be using Mandrake that includes loop-AES, AES encryption
type is unhashed and password length determines actual number of key bits
used to encrypt. AES128, AES192 and AES256 encryption types hash password
with SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512 and use specified number key bits to
encrypt regardless of password length. Same AES cipher is used in all cases,
only key is set up differently.

For new setups, use AES128, AES192 or AES256, and specify password seed with
'mount -o pseed=xxxxxxxxxx' or 'losetup -S xxxxxxxxxx'.

thanks !

aha, so when using just "AES", the password length itself determines the
number of key bits to encrypt

if i use "losetup -e AES -S xxxxxx&lt;-N-&gt;xxxxxxx" (meaning N characters for
seed) and then password with M characters, will the AES crypt bit size be
determined by N, by M or somehow by their combination ? Or which ever is
greater / smaller will determine the crypt bit size ?

thanks again - rkelly

Mandrake kernels include loop-AES, which is twice as fast on most modern
boxes than what CryptoAPI+cryptoloop can deliver. Not only is it faster, but
it also works with just about any maintained stable kernel that exists.

You are dead right in that Mandrake comes with the
AES encryption.

I thought that;
1. it would be nice to be able to try some other encryption
algorithms out and have some variety!
2. I wanted to see if I could.

So far I havn't had much luck; I've had to drop
several of the Mandrake provided kernel patches, incl.
the kdb patch, because it was this which was munging
the Makefile so that even though the cryptoloop/api
was showing in make config (et.al) it wasn't getting
compiled. I didn't know enough about the structure of
makefiles to work around it.

So put it down to mental exercise and learning!
;)

Cool! It compiles...

Just a few questions though;

1. am I going to need a patched losetup? The one on mandrake 9.
doesn't seem to like the -I option.
The one that comes with Mandrake 9 is;
losetup-2.11u-1mdk

2. I don't think that running 'make' should do any installation
work... 'make install' after 'make' is preferable.

frozen.
                            
Following the above named reasons, I am soliciting for your humble and =
confidential assistance to take custody of twenty  Million United States =
Dollars  ( US$20,000,000.00 ), also to front for me in the areas of business =
you desire profitable.
These funds have secretly been deposited into a confidential Security firm =
where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended beneficiary. The =
funds will be released to you by the Security firm based on my =
recommendations on that note, you will be presented as my partner who will be =
fronting for me and my family in any subsequent ventures.
Myself and my mother have decided to give 25% to you if you are able to help =
us claim this consignment.We have also decided to give you any money spent on =
phone calls or travelling expenses in the course of this transaction at the =
end of the transaction.
Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this =
business ventures, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly =

Basher Mobutu Sese-Seko.

FROM: DINO  WANGA

Sir,
  I am Dino Wanga.The son of former minister of finance (Wanga Makabo) of
the Republic of Sierra-Leone West Africa, based on the information I
gathered from your chamber of commerce and industry on your credibility, I
decide to contact for the assistance.
Regarding my zeal toward foreign investment and security for my life and
possession,
I therefore write to you a break down of this proposal.
My father died when a group of rebel soldier led by Sir Foday Sankoh
overthrown Government of sierra-Leone forcing the president out of power and
killing many members of the cabinet and ministerincuding my own father. When
it become apparently obvious that the country no longer safe for the
citizens due to the political war and massive killing and destruction of
properties, I decided to move to Holland with a treasure containing the sum
of US$12.500.000.00(twelve million five hundred thousand united state
dollars) through a diplomatic means, this fund is the last tangible money my
father left behind before his death.

The said amount is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am
currently seeking political asylum. While the consignment containing the
fund is in the custody of the diplomatic courier company they are not aware
of the content as it was deposited as personal effect and artifact. I am
seeking for partner who will serve as a the guardian of this fund with whom
I could plan the best way to move this money out of Holland for investment
which is my main purpose of contacting you.
Thus I decided to offer you 20% of the total money for assisting me to
actualize this project while 10% of the money has been set aside to offset
any incidental expenses that might incurred during the course of this funds
and the balance 70%shall be for me and my family which shall be invested in
your country. So if you are willing to assist me contact me on the number
above. And are will visit you country soonest in order to inquire areas of
possible business investment. I shall be sincerely glad if my request is
rendered.
Thank you
God bless you

Dino Wanga

More likely you did not build a floppy driver (block-major-2) into
your kernel and it's not available as a module.  

No idea what block-major-10 is though.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; I just compiled the loop device under the Linux
&gt; machine  whose version is 2.4.18. Do I need to any
&gt; other configuration?

You need kernel .config that matches your running kernel exactly (like
Jan-Benedict Glaw said earlier). And kernel source tree must be in fully
compiled form, as in after:

    make distclean
    cp /someplace/yourconfig-2.4.18.config .config
    make oldconfig
    make dep &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make bzImage &amp;&amp; make modules

And then compile loop-AES like this:

    cd ../loop-AES-v1.7b
    make LINUX_SOURCE=/path/to/your/kernel/source

Just running "make oldconfig &amp;&amp; make dep" is NOT enough. I have tried that.
Got burned. Trust me on this one.

Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,
and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this 
contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in 
the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and 
immense benefit. 

I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make 
this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly
to you. My name is  Chuli Savimbi, I am the eldest son and Personal Assistant 
to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address 
from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence 
this email. 

My father(Mentor) was killed in a battle with
government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd 
February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in 
command, assumed office 
as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my
father had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for 
leadership. 


Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office 
as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their 
ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned
to kill me. 

The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable
when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my father's death. As I lost my mentor in this 
struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle 
interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a 
peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts
and wars. 

For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here
(Holland) to seek political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your
highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my father's money 
that arose from Diamonds sales. 

This money (US$20.5million), which was already on its way to my father's Swiss 
Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was 
on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, 
europe in February when the tragic incident of my father's death occurred. 

I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money 
pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for 
security reasons, 
and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, 
the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe 
deposit. 

President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my 
father's assets and accounts abroad, to ground
UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in 
my name. 

Also I did not declare the funds to any authority for obvious reasons   there,I 
plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you 
understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is 
extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to loose this 
money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost 
secrecy.

Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money 
which is deposited in my name, from the
Security company, after which, the money will  be lodged into an account 
preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.

  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in 
this country is granted, and 
I have permission to do business and open an account
here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with
15%($3.075,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the
consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the 
security company, and the release codes of the vaults.

 Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, 
and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt 
response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance
in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me on the 
above email or musa_yu@hotmail.com  This will 
enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Angola, click on

Sincerely,
Chuli Savimbi.

Chris Rigsby wrote:
&gt; I apologize in advance if this has been extensively discussed, but I'm
&gt; curious about facts/opinions regarding the use of file-backed loop where
&gt; the file lives inside an ext3 filesystem.  For example,  I setup
&gt; /dev/loop3 to point to /home/rigsby/bigsecrets.dat and /home is an ext3
&gt; file system.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any concerns, advantages, or disadvantages to having the
&gt; source file for a file-backed loop in an ext3 filesystem versus ext2?

Best choice is to put loop directly on a partition. That has speed as well
as reliability benefits. Re-entering file system code from driver code is
still hovering on the edge of being unsafe. File backed loops are okay for
lightweight use. Heavy duty usage should be on device backed loops.

I obviously don't get it.

I have two 5GB files, /data/data0 and /data/data1.  I would like to be 
able to mount either, or both
(at the same time) using a cipher.  First my problem, then my configuration.

$ /usr/local/sbin/losetup -e aes -k 192 /dev/loop1 /data/data1
$ /usr/local/sbin/mount /mnt/crypt/data1
$ /usr/local/sbin/mount /mnt/crypt/data0

I don't know how it is that I can even mount /data0, because the fstab 
file uses loop0 for data0.  Anyway,

$ ls /mnt/crypt/data0
data  lost+found

Notice, the data directory.

$ /usr/local/sbin/umount /mnt/crypt/data0
$ /usr/local/sbin/umount /mnt/crypt/data1
$ /usr/local/sbin/losetup -d /dev/loop1
$ /usr/local/sbin/losetup -e aes -k 192 /dev/loop0 /data/data0
$ /usr/local/sbin/mount /mnt/crypt/data0
$ ls /mnt/crypt/data0
lost+found

Notice, the data directory is nolonger there!

What the heck is going on?  What is the proper way to mount multiple 
encrypted files via a loop back?

Here is my configuration.

RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I am  DR.SANNI AHMED., Chairman to the Contract Review Panel that was recently 
inaugurated by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to review the 
activities of past military government with particular reference to contracts 
awarded by all ministries between 1990 to 1999. In the course of carrying out our 
assigned duties, we discovered the sum of USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred 
thousand dollars) only lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This 
funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate 
of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was 
deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we 
have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to a 
country of our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe custody for us. We 
are however handicapped at the moment by our status as civil servants, which 
barred us from operating foreign accounts while still in government service.
 
Thus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of  Commerce, you and 
your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship. 
On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to handle a business of this 
nature, which informed our desire and  wish to enter into a partnership with you. 
This business involves the remittance of this amount into your bank account with 
the hope of travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. 
We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on your 
advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have 
mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.
 
The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the 
world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries 
like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or 
your firm will be regarded as one of those that executed one of such projects and 
therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since 
the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 
100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future 
for we are well connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the 
moment, we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the 
objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of 
two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the 
transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 74% will be for my 
colleagues and I while 1% has been earmarked to take care of any expenses that 
might arise in the course of this transaction.
 
If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an  e-mail with 
via:sanniahmed@ecplaza.net  for more clarifications. If however you are not 
interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this 
business with.
 
I anticpate a timely response from you.
 
Thanks.
 
Yours Sincerely,
 
DR.SANNI AHMED

DR.S.AHMED

Nothing wrong with above CONFIG_VT* options. Can you try mounting the
encrypted root partition (from your rescue floppy or whatever), and list
some files like this:

    mount -t ext3 /dev/hda6 /mnt -o loop=/dev/loop5,encryption=AES256
    ls -l /mnt/dev/console /mnt/sbin/init
    umount /mnt

&gt; I'm not sure if this is totally irrilavant, but i just noticed that even as
&gt; root i'm denied executing anything on my seperate /mnt/crypt, i've mounted
&gt; it with
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdc1  /mnt/crypt ext2
&gt; defaults,noauto,users,loop=/dev/loop1,encryption=AES256 0 0
&gt; 
&gt; I was aware you can pass a no-exe option, however pretty sure its not
&gt; default.

'users' mount option implies noexec. It is explained in mount man page.

Hi list,

How do I install cryptoapi on a 2.4.18 kernel with cryptoloop support?

First I tried

tar xjf cryptoapi-0.1.0.tar.bz2
cd cryptoapi-0.1.0
make patch-kernel KDIR=/usr/src/linux LOOP=iv
(btw: the doc states patchkernel - should be patch-kernel)
-&gt; no cryptoloop config in menuconfig
recompiled kernel anyway.
losetup -e twofish /dev/loop0 cryptofile
asks for a password but then claims that there is no cipher loaded
(although it is!)
---
The cipher does not exist, or a cipher module needs to be loaded into the kernel
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
---


so I tried the magic installer:
cd /usr/src/linux
w3m -dump_source "www.kerneli.org/go?2.4.18/AT" | sh
This time there is crytoloop in the kernel. But when I try to compile
it, it tells me to patch loop.c. 
---
you need to to patch your loop.c driver
warning: #warning LO_CRYPT_CRYPTOAPI not (yet) defined in kernel header)
---
Where do I get that patch???


Please help saving the remaining hair on my head and give me a hint!


Best regards

&gt; cd cryptoapi-0.1.0
&gt; make patch-kernel KDIR=/usr/src/linux LOOP=iv

&gt; losetup -e twofish /dev/loop0 cryptofile

&gt; (although it is!)
&gt; ---
&gt; The cipher does not exist, or a cipher module needs to be loaded into the kernel

&gt; ---

I'm looking into this problem. It's something that has
crept into the cryptoapi build in the last year; the older
patch sets give no problem. Your problem occurs across 
2.4.18,19 and 20 that I have tested and has existed
since mid-August 2002.

It may work if you do it as loadable modules, which is
fine for those who can afford the insecurity of loadable 
modules. It's temporarily broken for my needs though.

I presume you are using either a debian util-linux or
have patched and built one yourself. (or have util-linux
from a dist that pre-patches: I don't know if anyone
other than Debian do this.)

I've been too busy to attack this: I've just stuck with
the older patches... but I'm looking into it on the 
developer list now as it has not been fixed six months
on.

Nothing wrong with above CONFIG_VT* options. Can you try mounting the

i'm not using ROOTPIVOT so i'm not passing init from lilo, however i get the

Can you post your kernel .config for kernel you are trying to boot.
CONFIG_VT* are the most interesting parts. Mentioning kernel version may
help too.

Hi, the kernel is kernel.org 2.4.19 on redhat 8.0 on a K7.

Here's the interesting part...
# Character devices
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTY_COUNT=256

i've attached the whole config zipped, bit of a flood to post it all here :)

I'm not sure if this is totally irrilavant, but i just noticed that even as 
root i'm denied executing anything on my seperate /mnt/crypt, i've mounted 
it with

/dev/hdc1  /mnt/crypt ext2 
defaults,noauto,users,loop=/dev/loop1,encryption=AES256 0 0

I was aware you can pass a no-exe option, however pretty sure its not 
default.

Thanks for any help,
Brad.

'users' mount option implies noexec. It is explained in mount man page.

Nothing wrong with above CONFIG_VT* options. Can you try mounting the

some files like this:

    mount -t ext3 /dev/hda6 /mnt -o loop=/dev/loop5,encryption=AES256
    ls -l /mnt/dev/console /mnt/sbin/init

&gt; I'm not sure if this is totally irrilavant, but i just noticed that even as

Hi everybody,

reading the redhat 8.0 and losetup question archived in

http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2002-12/msg00061.html

and Herberts answer I now know that I#m not alone with that problem. 
Herbert posted a link to his rh8.0 rpm's which fix that problem.

They're compiled for kernel 2.4.18-14 which came on the original rh8 
cds. Actually I updated already to the 2.4.18-24.8.0 and will more 
likely use my self compiled kernel 2.4.20. So I guess it's better not 
to use these rpms. Can anybody point me to a different solution? Or 
shall I just update the losetup and mount by these rpms? A rpm -ivh 
obviously gives a

file /sbin/losetup from install of losetup-2.11r-10int conflicts with 
file from package losetup-2.11r-10

Thanks in advance

Thorsten

BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Dear sir/Madam, 
I am an accountant with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) =
and, also a member of the Contract Review committee. Presently, I'm  on a =
special diplomatic duty in the Nigeria foreign office in Amsterdam,the =
Netherlands.  A contract for the construction and laying of oil pipelines =
network from Warri-Port-Harcourt-Kaduna.has been awarded to a local firm and, =
  this contract was over invoiced to the tune of Nine Million,Six Hundred =
Thousand United State Dollars (US$9. 6Million). 
 
The over invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project, =
and now the local contractor have been fully paid but, the over invoiced =
amount is still floating in one of the offshore banks  of Central Bank of =
Nigeria in Canada .We now desire to transfer this money which is presently in =
a suspense account of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into any overseas =
account which we expect you to provide for us, if you are capable and able. 
For providing, the account where we shall remit the money,you will be =
entitled to 20% of the money,70% will be for myself and my partners,the =
remaining 10% will be set aside to settle all expenses incurred by both =
parties. 
I would require the following; 

1.Bank name and Address 
2.Name of Beneficiary
3 Company Name and Address
4. Account Number. 
5. Confidential Telephone  and Fax number of Beneficiary. 
 
 The above information would be used to make formal applications to the =
appropriate government parastatals such as the Federal Ministry of Finance =
(FMF), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Central Bank of =
Nigeria (CBN)   as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and =
onward transfer to the nominated account you would provide. In as much as , =
we are doing a deal, we would like to comply with all laid down procedures =
for transfer and contract of this nature. It does not matter whether or not =
your company did this contract or not. The assumption is that your company =
was awarded the major contract and subcontracted it out to the local company. =
We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the Apex Bank and the =
Federal Ministry of Finance All we need is a  trust worthy foreign partner to =
assist us in this mutual/beneficial deal. 
 
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded,we shall through our =
same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned =
Government Ministries for 100%security.We are civil servants and we do not =
want this opportunity to miss us, as opportunity  loss can never be regained
Please contact me immediately through my e-mail address,whether or not you =
are interested in this deal. If you are not,it will enable me scout for =
another foreign partner to carry out this deal.But where you are interested, =
send the required document aforementioned herein without delay,as time is of =
great essence in this deal. 

I await your anticipated co-operation and response. 

Best Regards

DR.FRANK BAMAWO.

DR.SANNI AHMED
PLOT 1121
ADETOKUNBO ADEMOLA STREET
VICTORIA ISLAND-LAGOS
NIGERIA


 
Dear Sir,
 
RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I am  DR.SANNI AHMED., Chairman to the Contract Review Panel that was recently 
inaugurated by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to review the 
activities of past military government with particular reference to contracts 
awarded by all ministries between 1990 to 1999. In the course of carrying out our 
assigned duties, we discovered the sum of USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred 
thousand dollars) only lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This 
funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate 
of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was 
deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we 
have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to a 
country of our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe custody for us. We 
are however handicapped at the moment by our status as civil servants, which 
barred us from operating foreign accounts while still in government service.
 
Thus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of  Commerce, you and 
your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship. 
On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to handle a business of this 
nature, which informed our desire and  wish to enter into a partnership with you. 
This business involves the remittance of this amount into your bank account with 
the hope of travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. 
We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on your 
advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have 
mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.
 
The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the 
world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries 
like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or 
your firm will be regarded as one of those that executed one of such projects and 
therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since 
the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 
100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future 
for we are well connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the 
moment, we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the 
objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of 
two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the 
transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 74% will be for my 
colleagues and I while 1% has been earmarked to take care of any expenses that 
might arise in the course of this transaction.
 
If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an  e-mail with 
via:sanniahmed@ecplaza.net  for more clarifications. If however you are not 
interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this 
business with.
 
I anticpate a timely response from you.
 
Thanks.
 
Yours Sincerely,
 
DR.SANNI AHMED

DR.S.AHMED

Dear Friend,

Let me introduce myself, I am OSMAN MANSSARY, the son of 
late Sheikh OSMAN Abdullai, of  blessed memory who was once a 
chief Geologist of the Sierra Leonian National Diamond 
Mining Corporation. Who became a victim of the rebel 
forces fighting against Ahmed Tijan Kabbah's 
Government? 

My mother informed me of a deposit of a huge amount of 
money my father deposited in Netherlands with a Security 
Company and she gave me all the documents and proof  that he has 
deposited with the Company.$25.5million US Dollars in 
three sealed boxes, which he deposited in the form of 
jewelry and precious items to protect the fund. The 
Security Company therefore does not know the real 
content of the deposit. I have sent a photo copy of the documents to 
the Security Company for confirmation and they confirmed it's true. 

Because of the political instability and crises in 
Sierra Leone, I am presently a refugee residing in a 
refugee camp in The Netherlands .Hence; we will want you to 
assist us to secure the fund out of Netherlands as soon as 
we get the fund out of the Security Company. There 
after we will now map out how you will assist us to 
invest part of the fund in any kind of Business that 
will be profitable, and our relocation from Netherland to 
the country of investment. In addition, for your 
assistance my mother and I have agreed to give you 20% 
of the total amount for assistance. 

I will therefore request that you contact me through

so that we discuss first, for me to know

Thanks for your co-operation in advance. I am looking

I tried loadable modules. It did not work.

&gt; I presume you are using either a debian util-linux or

debian, right.

&gt; I've been too busy to attack this: I've just stuck with

tnx.

Getting PPDD to work on RH isn't the easiest thing in the world because of
version differences (due to RH patching their systems heavily) You can
find packaged version of PPDD for RH 7.3 and 8.0 (but sorry, no 7.2) at
http://ppdd4rhl.sourceforge.net/ so you don't need to patch + rebuild 
everything, however those packages currently don't help in encrypting 
the root in any way.

P.S. You'll get more easily answers to PPDD-specific questions on the 
ppdd-mailing list: ppdd@linux01.gwdg.de

Some questions:

1) Where is the password stored that you type in upon
running losetup? Is it stored somewhere on the local
machine, or is it embedded in the "cryptofile" that
holds all the encrypted materials?

2) The reason I ask is that I would like to use an
encrypted filesystem across the network. If i set
everything up on MACHINE1, how would I connect to it
across the network? Create a traditional samba mount
so that my local MACHINE2 can access the encrypted
file/system "cryptofile" and then setup another
loopback on the local MACHINE2?

3) I guess what I'm wondering is what will happen with
the passwords. What happens if I take the giant file
that I use to store all the encrypted materials,
"cryptofile" and move it to another MACHINE3 and try
to use it?

Thanks

Your daily humor:

Two story house

A man appears before a judge one day, asking for a divorce.
The judge quietly reviews some papers and then says,
"Please tell me why you are seeking a divorce."

"Because," the man says,"I live in a two-story house."

The Judge replies, "What kind of a reason is that?
What is the big deal about a two-story house?"

The man answers, "Well Judge, one story is 'I have a headache'
and the other story is 'It's that time of the month.'

On handhelds.org we have over 25 mailing list, we used to get
lots of spam.  After installing SpamAssassin we now get almost
no spam.  Could this be done for this mailing list???

</body></email><email><emailId>20030105054759</emailId><senderName></senderName><senderEmail>dave-mlist</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-01-05 05:47:59-0400</timestampReceived><subject>why does loop-aes over USB2.0 make 2.4.18 unstable? (block-major-2)</subject><body>

Since I recently upgraded to an SMP system, I re-installed RH8.0, and
followed the directions for installing loop-aes.  I have a usb drive
which is one big loop-aes partition, so I copied over my previous
system's /etc/fstab entry, and I plugged in my usb drive.  Within 1
minute, my system froze.

I tried kernels 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 with identical results.  It seems
that whenever I plug in the usb drive, I see "modprobe: can't locate
block-major-2".  I'm not sure if this is a result of loop-aes, but I
thought someone in this list might have seen this before.

Since block-major-2 is the floppy device, I'm quite confused.  I
expect usb-storage to make the drive look like a scsi device, not a
floppy.

If I leave the usb drive plugged in while I boot, I see the
block-major-2 errors as soon as the system tries to mount the
filesystems (even though /mnt/crypt is not mounted by default).

If I plug in the usb drive after booting, I see the following in my
/var/log/messages file:

When I run "mount /mnt/crypt", mount succeeds, but I only have a
minute or so before the whole system locks up.  I've done this about
15 times in the last 48 hours.

Any suggestions?

   Why don't you put Join4Free.Com in your own procmail filter? Any mail from

yours sent to the list, which is silly.

hi,

i've installed loop-AES-v1.7a. the installation of the
module is ok. i can load it.
i'm running on a debian, the kernel 2.4.18, gcc
version 2.95.4 and util-linux 2.11n-4. 

When i run the #make tests in the directory loop-aes,
i have this error:

losetup: invalid option -- H

Who can help me, thank you very much! You remark that
i 'm a newbie on linux, so sorry maybe for the simple
question.

You need to recompile util-linux as explained in loop-AES' README. Otherwise
you will be missing a boatload of crucial features.

hi i'm using loop-aes with aes128 mostly, I would like to know how we can 
calculate the memory usage the loop device needs for a specific amount of 
data to encrypt. jari mentioned when he talked about swap encryption that 
when the machine needs to swap it tries to free memory by it, but to 
encrypt the swap we need memory, and bingo :) well, how can we calculate 
that need or how does it work?
regards,
greg

Attn.
I feel compelled to write and request your assistance.
Please, kindly excuse my intrusion into your private
business. I got your contact through a Business
Directory in my effort to get a foreign partner whom 
I can entrust with my family investment,while i was
in the recreational centre at the refugee camp in 
the Netherlands.


My name is Kabungo M.Paul Jnr. the eldest son of Hon. 
Kabungo Makinde Paul,former minister of finance in 
Liberia. The junta Chales Taylor assassinated my father 
when he dethrone President,  Samuel Doe, which 
subsequently led to outbreak of war in my country.

The perennial war in the country forced me and my
Family into exile in various countries. After the
Death of my father, we discovered among my father?s
Documents that he deposited some funds totaling Twenty
-fivemillion Five hundred Thousand United State Dollars
(US$25. 500.000.00) with a private security company in
Netherlands. I am now under political asylum in the
Netherlands while my mother and my siblings are in 
Hideout in Dakar Senegal.

My mother advised me to search for a reliable business
oriented person who can help us invest these funds. We
have proposed 20% to you for your assistance while 5%
is set aside for any possible contigencies. Modality
has been work out to the highest level to move these
Funds out of Africa as soon as you signify your
interest to help us invest the balance 75% into a
viable business in your country.

The assistance we are soliciting from you is to help
us receive and invest the money why my family will
join you in your Country as soon as we achieved our
desired goal. I will appreciate it if you could write
me to enable us discuss further on the whole issue
raised herein. These burdens appeared enormous for me
due to my ignorance in the business industry and
coupled with my present social status.

Sir, I am eagerly anticipating your swift response.

Regards,
Kabungo M.Paul Jnr.

Hi,

I have been using SuSE 7.1 with an updated kernel 2.4.16-4GB from SuSE
including loop_fish2 module. I have an encrypted partition using the
SuSE twofish module. The fstab-entry for ot looks like this:

/dev/hdd2	/mnt/	reiserfs	loop,encryption=twofish,noauto,user 1 2

As you can see, I am using reiserfs instead of ext2, as stated in
the loop-AES READMEs. This works just fine.

The problem is that I want to migrate to Debian Woody 3.0r0. I am using
Debians kernel 2.4.20 with loop-AES v1.7a and ciphers-v1.1a and
util-linux-2.11.y. All the components work very well, loop-AES is
very fast, even with AES256. But I am not able to mount the
encrypted partition when running Debian with loop-AES. I already
tried all possible options, this means

losetup -e twofish(128|196|256) with and without -H and -I options

mount ..... -o loop,encryption=all three twofishes, with and without phash 
(all possible values) and loinit (both values) (I used the readonly switch
in all cases, of course.)

but I just can not mount the device. Something seems to be wrong
with the decryption, because if I look at the loopdevice with

cat /dev/loopX | od -s 

from inside the running SuSE system there are many "ReIsErFS" strings on the loop-device,
which seems to some ReiserFS header. But in all above mentioned cases doing this
when running from Debian with loop-AES twofish I don't get ANY ReiserFS strings.

Another strange thing I do not understand is when I do a

head -c15 /dev/urandom | uuencode -m - | head -2 | tail -1 \
	| losetup -p 0 -e AESxxx /dev/loopX /dev/hdaX
time dd if=dev/zero of=dev/loopX bs=4k conv=notrunc 2&gt;/dev/null

the used time is always the same, regerdles if using AES128, AES192 or AES256. So
obviously the harddisk is the bottleneck here. But WHY is the idle-time,
as shown by top in all three cases at 82% on my PIII-500MHz machine? Shouldn't
AES192 use more cycles then AES128, and AES256 more than AES192? Is something
going wrong here?

I am absolutely clueless, PLEASE HELP!

Posting exact error message would help. If error message was "ioctl:
LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument", then loading the loop_twofish module to
kernel before mount or losetup command should cure your problem. Do this as
root:

    modprobe loop_twofish
    mount -t reiserfs /dev/hdd2 /mnt -o \
loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=twofish128,phash=rmd160,loinit=1

Or alternatively, add this line to your /etc/fstab

    /dev/hdd2  /mnt  reiserfs  \
loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=twofish128,phash=rmd160,loinit=1,noauto,user  0  0

And this line to your debian /etc/modules file so that loop_twofish gets
loaded to kernel at boot.

    loop_twofish

And then mount should work as any user, like this:

    mount /mnt

&gt; Another strange thing I do not understand is when I do a
&gt; 
&gt; head -c15 /dev/urandom | uuencode -m - | head -2 | tail -1 \
&gt; &gt; losetup -p 0 -e AESxxx /dev/loopX /dev/hdaX
&gt; time dd if=dev/zero of=dev/loopX bs=4k conv=notrunc 2&gt;/dev/null
&gt; 
&gt; the used time is always the same, regerdles if using AES128, AES192 or AES256. So

Speed differences among AES128, AES192 and AES256 do not vary much. AES256
offers about 72% performance of AES128.

Hi,

i have my system partitions (all except /boot) encrypted with loop-aes. Now, 
this setup worked fine on my SuSE 8.0 distro (of course copying was a bit 
slower then without encryption). Now, I installed gentoo on my system, using 
the same encryption method. The Problem: When copying files, in fact 
everytime i get disc activity my system goes very 'sluggish', meaning i type 
stuff, and see it all appear 2 or 3 sec later....meaning i move the mouse and 
it doesnt, but jumps after a while. 
I was wondering why this could be, and how I might fix it....Changing the 
Priority of the loop? processes from -9 to 0 didnt help very much :(.

love to be helped :D

Hello:

I'm attempting to apply the util-linux patch to the source code for Red 
Hat 8.0's util-linux package.  Here are my obstacles:

1. The patch included with loop-aes 1.7 is for util-linux-2.11y, and 
RedHat 8.0's util-linux rpm is based on 2.11r.
2. Redhat applies a HUGE number of patches to the 2.11r "pristine" 
sources before compiling and distributing  their rpm file.
3. Lucky enough, during the rpm build process, only 8 hunks fail 
(mount/Makefile, lomount, swapon.c[all 4 hunks fail], swapon.8)

Is anyone else out there running loop-aes on Red Hat 8?  I'm just 
curious if someone else has already done this.  I'm a bit (no much) 
hesitation to use the pristine, non-RedHat patched 2.11y+loop-aes on my 
system, for fear that something might go wrong.  That, and I'd like to 
be able to provide an easy-to-install RPM to people who want to use this 
outstanding software with RedHat 8.

Suggestions, comments?

Thanks,

&lt;/CR&gt;

In a nutshell:

Encrypted swap on kernels 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 has fatal problems which
are not present in 2.4.18.

My test setup:

	32 MB RAM (limited by mem= on kernel command line)

	Partitions set up as follows:
	hda1:  512MB swap partition
	hda2:  2.9G filesystem partition
	hda3:  128MB boot partition (clear)
	hda4:  512MB "other" partition (more on this later)

	One of:
	Linux 2.4.18 with loop-AES 1.5b, 1.6e, 1.6f, 1.7a
	Linux 2.4.19 with loop-AES 1.6f
	Linux 2.4.20 with loop-AES 1.7a
	Linux 2.4.20 with cryptoapi 2.4.20.1

My test:

1.  Set up filesystem and swap partitions.  I tested all four combinations
of encrypted/clear filesystem/swap on 2.4.20.  "Encrypted" means AES with
256 bit keys through a loop device.  "Clear" means direct access to the
partition with no intervening loop device.

2.  Run the following tasks in parallel, each one in an infinite loop:

	a.  bonnie -u0 -f -n0 -s1024 (run on the filesystem on hda2)

	b.  tar xjf linux-2.4.20.tar.bz2 &amp;&amp; 
	    cd linux-2.4.20 &amp;&amp;
	    make oldconfig &amp;&amp;
	    make dep &amp;&amp;
	    make -j5 bzImage modules &amp;&amp;
	    cd .. &amp;&amp;
 	    rm -rf linux-2.4.20
	(also run on hda2)

	c.  cat /dev/zero &gt; /dev/hda4

	d.  watch ps xar

Obviously there will be a lot of swapping and memory pressure when running
all of those at once on a machine with 32MB of RAM.  That's the point.  ;-)
I've been discovering this accidentally for some time now--system locks up
after a few days of normal use--but the above recipe triggers the problems
in only a few minutes.

My results:

                        SE-FE   SE-FC   SC-FE   SC-FC
2.4.20+cryptoapi        hangs   ??      hangs   ??
2.4.20+loop-AES         hangs   hangs   ok      ok
2.4.19+loop-AES         hangs   ??      ??      ok
2.4.18+loop-AES         ok      ??      ??      ok

SE-FE = Swap Encrypted Filesystem Encrypted,
SC-FE = Swap Clear Filesystem Encrypted, etc.

hangs = hangs after a few minutes or hours
ok    = doesn't hang after days of continuous abuse
??    = not tested

2.4.20 + cryptoapi locks up almost immediately.  I never got the
'tar' command to finish, even with clear swap.  Processes get stuck in
various states.  Sometimes I can hit ^C and restart the 'tar' process.
Sometimes ^C will not kill a stuck process but the rest of the system
continues to function.  Sometimes the system locks up completely.
I didn't run all the test combinations as cryptoapi wasn't able to even
finish the test setup, let alone the tests themselves.

2.4.20 + loop-AES runs for a few minutes or a few hours with encrypted
swap, then kswapd gets stuck in D state.  All further swapping on
the machine stops, since it needs kswapd to work and kswapd is stuck.
One by one, every process on the system locks up as it needs to page in
or out to swap.

2.4.20 + loop-AES runs for days with clear swap, regardless of whether
the filesystem is encrypted or clear.

2.4.19 seems to be similar to 2.4.20, although I ran only one of the
test cases on 2.4.19.  I gather that there were significant changes
to the VM stuff between 2.4.18 and 2.4.19, so I presume that 2.4.19 and
2.4.20 have all the same problems with encrypted swap.

I have been using 2.4.18 + loop-AES since 2.4.18 was released, and
earlier 2.4.x versions with loop-AES since the end of 2001.  No problems.

 Hi, I got a problem of loop-aes on a SMP machine. I
am trying to port the loop-aes to a DELL machine with
4 CPUs. The system just hangs there when I use mke2fs
to format the loop device. It consumes nearly all the
CPU resource and never returns. The same loop-aes
works fine on machine with only 1 CPU. So what is the
problem? 

Another thing is after I comment out the aes_encrypt()
and aes_decrypt() that means loop-aes without
encryption everything is OK. The aes_encrypt() and
aes_decrypt() support SMP? Maybe there is some problem
here.

Any reply will be appreciated.

Thanks.

What version of loop-AES are you using?

What kernel version?

File backed or device backed loop?

What is the size of loop device?

If I have make a wild guess about your problem, my guess is that you have
managed to compile the driver for kernel configuration that does not match
your running kernel configuration.

&gt; and aes_decrypt() that means loop-aes without

aes_encrypt() and aes_decrypt() are re-entrant and SMP safe.

Thanks for the warning. I had problems with 2.4.19 but didn't bother
to track it down due to lack of time. I'd not tried 2.4.20 yet.

I think I will sit on 2.4.18 awhile longer...

What filesystems are you using? If you are using ext3, I hope it is patched
with Andrew Morton's ext3 patches.

Can you re-run your hanging tests cases with this patch applied to
loop-AES-v1.7a? This patch reduces stack usage and may make loop little bit
slower.

I've been using encrypted swap on 2.4.19 since it was availible, so its must 
be an issue when combined with other parts of your setup.  IE scsi or intel 
etc etc.

I'm sure it was far worse than that. I use a bunch of patch sets
on my "production" kernels, and tracking down the problem just wasn't
worth the time when 2.4.18 worked just fine as is and 2.4.19 didn't
really offer me anything new.

Have you actually run the tests I described?

How long have you observed a 2.4.19 kernel with encrypted swap
running under _all_ of the test conditions?  The 'cat /dev/zero &gt;
/dev/some_raw_partition' thread in particular seems to be required to
reproduce the problem.

I have noticed that 2.4.19+ kernels are quite a bit faster than 2.4.18
at filesystem I/O...  when they're not crashing, locking up, or otherwise
being highly offensive.  ;-)

locked up after 5 hours.

Now building fix-pausing-2e...

fix-pausing-2h will lock up too. At least here it did.

I am still chasing this bug which _appears_ to be some sort of race in VM.
As I mentioned earlier, Red Hat kernel 2.4.20-2.21 seems to work ok, but
that kernel has different VM than mainline.

...and I greatly appreciate your efforts so far.  It's interesting that

Great.  Looks like I'm pretty much screwed anyway.  I'm running 2.4.20 
mainline.  I'll go look for the RedHat 2.4.20 kernel tonight...

Hey, would this (running 2.4.20 mainline in a RedHat 8 system) explain 
why I often see startup/log messages like this:
modprobe: cannot locate device block-major-2
also, same as above, but block-major-10

Thanks,

And I think everyone owes you thanks for digging into it. Tell
me if I'm wrong, but if this is a race in VM, it seems the same
thing should show up as a problem in the linux crypto patches 
as well and a fix to the kernel for one should fix the other
as well.

Herbert. have you done any 2.4.19 or 20 testing? I've not had
luck with the 19 for other reasons, let alone getting as far as
the crypto swap.

Not Herbert, but I've been running CryptoAPI on filesystems and swap
under 2.4.20 for some time now, with no problems. (And before that,
2.4.20-rc1, 2.4.20-pre7, and 2.4.19).

cryptoapi 0.1.0

If Jari is seeing a race condition in the VM layer though, it
might just be that his code happens to hit a bad window and
"ours" hasn't... yet. He may just simply be the first one
to tickle it the wrong way. 

I'm sure he'll jump on whether this is likely or just
worry on my part. I also don't envy him. Races can be a bitch
to track down.

Well,

as it seems, the problem was/is not that simple. After having changed my 
harddrives to use dma (yes i double checked them all) I still get the lagging 
mouse etc. if i put some load on my system. E.g. if i compile something in a 
terminal in kde, then my load goes up to 2.5 (is this unusually high ?), and 
my mouse starts only getting updated 2 times/sec, same is with keyboard 
input. With SuSE i never ever got a laggy mouse (ok, maybe with load 10 or 
something). 
My System:

AMD Athlon 1.2 GHz FSB 133
512 MB PC-133 2-2-2 Cl2
3 HD's, all (relatively) current:
root@notch pwk # hdparm -Tt /dev/hda /dev/hdb /dev/hde

/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.65 seconds =196.92 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.74 seconds = 36.78 MB/sec

/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.67 seconds =191.04 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.76 seconds = 36.36 MB/sec

Sorry for that empty message =)
about Suse kernel + gentoo, I haven't tried that, because its not so easy. 
Gentoo uses devfs, SuSE doesnt - I cant just change the suse kernel to use 
devfs, then suse will not boot anymore etc. Im using the same config though, 
that shouldnt make a difference. Gentoo kernel is 2.4.19, SuSE is 2.4.20, and 
both have some performance patches on them (low latency for suse, gentoo has 
low latency and some more).

Is there anything specific I might have done wrong ?

Thanks in advance

   I'm a bit mystified about this whole "slowness" problem. You're running a
1.2gig cpu? I'm running several linux boxes (slackware and heavily modified
redhat) on 200mhz and 266mhz cpus and really don't see much slowness. Certainly
nothing with mouse or keyboard. And I like to keep about something like 12 to 20
windows open in gnome. 
   I've had 800mhz boxes at work running linux, which, besides booting faster,
seemed little at all faster than my 233 box at home. If you are seeing real
sloth on your machine, I'd try a whole new installation. I know at one point I
was trying some Mandrake issues, and found extreme variation in installs -- some
very, very slow. 
   But really -- come'on -- I've run web and email servers for fairly large
institutions on 200mhz linux boxes, with no complaints from around 500 email
account users -- and you're seeing sloth in a single user 1.2gig box? Good
grief. I'd wipe it out and start over. Try slackware once, see how that runs,
then try something a bit more exotic.

Well =)

im not yet on demolition course, since I like my fresh install of gentoo very 
much, and since I spent a lot of time to get it this way. So, please get me 
some constructive stuff to try out, and I will greatly appreciate it and try 
it =). BTW: I dont realy think the CPU makes a big difference, theres 
something about priorities wrong (my mouse movement is not as important as 
compiling, or as HD access, or as something else, so it seems to me). I 
already tried reniceing X to -10 or something, but that didnt change the 
behavior of my mousepointer :(.

Still in need of help...

   That may be, but I've done many new installs of various distros, and
sometimes it's very clear that something is missing or not installed
properly. And the only solution is formating the drive and starting over. 
   Don't know about gentoo, but I do know it's fairly common occurence with both
mandrake and susi. And if you're seeing mouse or keyboard sloth when doing a
compile, something is very seriously wrong. It's not a matter of setting
priorities -- or at least in 14 years of running *nix systems, I've never seen
that happen. I just got done compiling a new kernel on a a 266 box with gnome
running with 8 mozilla windows running, 5 xterms, opera with 5 windows, and
openoffice with two sessions -- and didn't notice the any slowness during the
compile. Well, of course, it would have run the compile faster if I didn't have
all the rest going, but everything was perfectly usable. 
   I'd format the drive and start over. You've got a whole lot more wrong than
just a little tuning will take care of.

I meant that you try SuSE kernel source recompiled with gentoo kernel
configuration, with CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y and CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y. Just leave
SuSE kernel binary as it is, and SuSE will continue to boot just fine.

Since you mentioned that you are willing to experiment, can you also try
with some mainline kernel without new O(1) scheduler? I see bad
interactivity with O(1) scheduler without any crypto.

&gt; &gt; I have been using SuSE 7.1 with an updated kernel 2.4.16-4GB from SuSE

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; /dev/hdd2       /mnt/   reiserfs        loop,encryption=twofish,noauto,user 1 2
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As you can see, I am using reiserfs instead of ext2, as stated in
&gt; &gt; the loop-AES READMEs. This works just fine.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem is that I want to migrate to Debian Woody 3.0r0. I am using
&gt; &gt; Debians kernel 2.4.20 with loop-AES v1.7a and ciphers-v1.1a and
&gt; &gt; util-linux-2.11.y. All the components work very well, loop-AES is
&gt; &gt; very fast, even with AES256. But I am not able to mount the
&gt; &gt; encrypted partition when running Debian with loop-AES. I already
&gt; &gt; tried all possible options, this means
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; losetup -e twofish(128|196|256) with and without -H and -I options
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; mount ..... -o loop,encryption=all three twofishes, with and without phash
&gt; &gt; (all possible values) and loinit (both values) (I used the readonly switch
&gt; &gt; in all cases, of course.)
&gt; 
&gt; Posting exact error message would help. If error message was "ioctl:
&gt; LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument", then loading the loop_twofish module to
&gt; kernel before mount or losetup command should cure your problem. Do this as
&gt; root:
&gt; 
&gt; modprobe loop_twofish
&gt; mount -t reiserfs /dev/hdd2 /mnt -o \
&gt; loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=twofish128,phash=rmd160,loinit=1 
&gt; Or alternatively, add this line to your /etc/fstab
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdd2  /mnt  reiserfs  \
&gt; loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=twofish128,phash=rmd160,loinit=1,noauto,user  0  0 
&gt; And this line to your debian /etc/modules file so that loop_twofish gets
&gt; loaded to kernel at boot.
&gt; 
&gt; loop_twofish
&gt; 
&gt; And then mount should work as any user, like this:
&gt; 
&gt; mount /mnt
&gt; 
Well, probably I wasn't precise enough: Of course I did a modprobe / insmod first, \
which worked as it should to, without any error messages. losetup works without \
problems, too. That is the point! I do not get any error messages, still I can access \
/dev/loopX (with X standing for the loopdevicenr used as argument to losetup), but \
the stream I get, when I use for example
cat /dev/loopX
is still encrypted (I tried all combinations of all possible options to losetup, as I \
stated out before).
But when I do this on SuSE, I get the unencrypted stream with strings like "ReIsErFs" \
in it. That is the reason why I assume the modules does not (really) decrypt how it \
is supposed to be.

I even compared the two sources and didn't see any essential changes which could \
explain this (besides Jari's improvements of course ;-) )

One further hint: If I try to acces the filesystem using
mount -t reiserfs /dev/hdd2 /mnt \
-o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=twofish128,phash=rmd160,loinit=1 

reiserfs complains that it does not find it's superblock, which is one more evidence \
that the device is still crypted.
I also checked the reiserfs versions, they are both the same.

Regerds,

Well, what should I say, it works perfectly with the patch. But this way
on can not use losetup, one has to do it the mount-way. But that is
no problem for me, I just wanna access the data. And probably it's easy
to patch losetup accordingly, I didn't have any look yet.

Thank you very much.

loop-AES's device backed loop preallocates a predetermined amount of RAM
pages at losetup/mount time. It does not allocate any more thereafter at
all, but recycles preallocated pages. That means that it is encrypted swap
and encrypted filesystem safe no matter what amount of data you throw at it.

Amount of preallocation just affects performance: too little preallocation
causes slow performance, and too large preallocation just wastes RAM without
significant performance improvement.

This is explained in loop-AES' README file. Look for section "Performance
tuning for 2.4 kernels".

As to question of how many simultaneous writes, each device backed loop can
have preallocated number of pages in-flight simultaneously. In-flight
meaning that a request has been sent to underlying driver (ide or scsi), but
underlying driver has not yet acknowledged that request as completed.

You could set "options loop lo_prealloc=200" in your /etc/modules.conf but I
doubt it improves performance. 24 Mbyte/sec may well be the maximum your
disk can do. How fast is that same disk when used without encryption (and
without loop)?

(de)ciphering requires many work. I don't know usual performances in a such
case, but from my experience with other tools (IPsec in FreeBSD, in particular)
24 MB/s seems to be a good perf.

I think the processor is the bottleneck. What is your CPU usage when using
cryptoloop?

Thank you very much for your response.

i will do that, but when i've read the message in the
readme file of the util-linux, i would be very
careful.

can i install any of the version of util-linux with
gcc 2.95.4 and any version of libc6? or i re-install
only the util-linux 2.11n-4?

best regards

   Well, I guess I'm not overly concerned about the problems of someone who
won't lift a finger to help themselves, but expects others to take care of
problems for them.


&gt; The solution for this list, which is the one adopted by a lot of lists 
&gt; (like recently gnupg.org mialing-lists) is : moderation.
&gt; 

   You're asking for the list owner to go to a heck of a lot of extra work. And
I'd definitely object to "volunteer moderators" -- how do we know we can trust
them? 


&gt; All the e-mails received from addresses who hadn't subscribed are sended 
&gt; to a moderator, who validate every week the *real* linux questions, and

&gt; 

   The cypherpunk node at lne.com has pretty effectively solved this problem
without too much work on the part of the listowner, if this list were to seek
such a solution, I'd suggest looking there first.

  However -- what I do really object to is the fact that I didn't get the spam
that started this thread, but now I've gotten 7 emails regarding it. Which is
the real problem, the spam or people posting complaints to the list about it? If
you must complain, why not do it to the listowner directly? Why burden the rest
of us with what is *your* problem? 
  And with all the spam that comes to everyone everyday, if you really aren't
running procmail or some other filter, I guess I don't know what to
say. Probably I should just add the complainers to the filter.

&gt;&gt; I respectfully disagree. There are more than a few regimes that would

&gt;&gt; lets these folks get info without risking their lives.
&gt;
&gt; rofl. sure.

The SLORC in Burma regularly troll USENET and web forums looking for
critics to attack and/or silence. The Church of Scientolgy also spends an
enormous amount of time looking for critics to slap with lawsuits. You can
also add more than a few central and south american countries, and a
shitload of middle east regimes to that list.

&gt;
&gt; point me out one time this has EVER happened on this list.
&gt;
&gt; now i can point you to the MANY times its been abused for porno spams.

Non-sequitor. State thugs aren't in a habit of bragging about evil deeds
on email lists. You will see the spam, but some poor fuck who speaks out
about an evil government will just go silent once he or his family becomes
known.

&gt;
&gt; and the day someone anon posts child porn to the list through this hole,
&gt; i guarantee the list will be shut down permanently by the feds.

Were you planning on doing it? We did have a nut named Ken Pangborn who
took on anon remailers singlehandedly... posting nazi and klan filth on
USENET through them in an attempt to get them shut down. They refused to
hand over the names of posters he thought were slandering him, and he
threw a hissyfit that continues in alt.usenet.kooks and the men's support
groups to this day.

&gt;
&gt; it's a disaster waiting to happen.
&gt;

I doubt it.

&gt; and you're advocating list abuse.
&gt;

Exactly where did I make a post advocating abuse? Put words in your own
mouth, not mine.


&gt;&gt; The list "owner" could blacklist spammers... but this would require
&gt;&gt; him to devote time better spent programming to list moderation. He
&gt;&gt; might even have to pay for a better service. I'm sure what he has now
&gt;&gt; is free of costs.
&gt;
&gt; only allowing subscribers to post is the proper fix. it requires zero
&gt; effort.

If you think you know what the proper fix is, then start your own damned
list.

As for myself, I feel you are not worth arguing with, and am placing your
address in my killfile.... what you should have done in the first place.

    You really can't do that on a crypto list -- stops people from posting anon
or with nyms, etc. Many of the people who need crypto the most wouldn't dare
post from a real address.

Hi all

I have a working crypted loopback device with
my 2.4.20 kernel. Everything I needed from
the crypto section I compiled as a module.

Mounting my crypted FS does not work until
i modprobe cryptoapi and cryptoloop, then
it mounts and unmounts cleanly, but after
unmounting 

rmmod -a 

only removes the cipher, crytoapi and
cryptoloop stay in memory. I worked around
by loading those modules at bootup time,
having those modules loaded at all the time.

Can anybody tell me how to load und unload
those modules dynamically without invoking
modprobe/insmod directly?

thanks in advance

Peter

&gt; I tried kernels 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 with identical results.  It seems
&gt; that whenever I plug in the usb drive, I see "modprobe: can't locate

&gt; thought someone in this list might have seen this before.

&gt; Any suggestions?

Is your SMP kernel .config exactly same as your previous UP kernel .config
(excluding UP -&gt; SMP change)? Your kernel config appears a little strange
since it does not have floppy support enabled at all.

Posting your /etc/fstab line and your kernel .config might help. I suggest
that you check your kernel .config for missing bits and recompile your
kernel and loop-AES module. At least add support for block-major-2 "Floppy
disks" and char-major-97 "Parallel port generic ATAPI interface".

Download util-linux-2.11y from ftp.kernel.org and follow instructions in the
README file. You can copy-and-paste the commands directly and it will work
ok on debian woody.

Attn.
I feel compelled to write and request your assistance.
Please, kindly excuse my intrusion into your private
business. I got your contact through a Business
Directory in my effort to get a foreign partner whom 
I can entrust with my family investment,while i was
in the recreational centre at the refugee camp in 
the Netherlands.


My name is Kabungo M.Paul Jnr. the eldest son of Hon. 
Kabungo Makinde Paul,former minister of finance in 
Liberia. The junta Chales Taylor assassinated my father 
when he dethrone President,  Samuel Doe, which 
subsequently led to outbreak of war in my country.

The perennial war in the country forced me and my
Family into exile in various countries. After the
Death of my father, we discovered among my father?s
Documents that he deposited some funds totaling Twenty
-fivemillion Five hundred Thousand United State Dollars
(US$25. 500.000.00) with a private security company in
Netherlands. I am now under political asylum in the
Netherlands while my mother and my siblings are in 
Hideout in Dakar Senegal.

My mother advised me to search for a reliable business
oriented person who can help us invest these funds. We
have proposed 20% to you for your assistance while 5%
is set aside for any possible contigencies. Modality
has been work out to the highest level to move these
Funds out of Africa as soon as you signify your
interest to help us invest the balance 75% into a
viable business in your country.

The assistance we are soliciting from you is to help
us receive and invest the money why my family will
join you in your Country as soon as we achieved our
desired goal. I will appreciate it if you could write
me to enable us discuss further on the whole issue
raised herein. These burdens appeared enormous for me
due to my ignorance in the business industry and
coupled with my present social status.

Sir, I am eagerly anticipating your swift response.

Regards,
Kabungo M.Paul Jnr.

&gt; Well, what should I say, it works perfectly with the patch. But this way
&gt; on can not use losetup, one has to do it the mount-way. But that is
&gt; no problem for me, I just wanna access the data. And probably it's easy
&gt; to patch losetup accordingly, I didn't have any look yet.

lomount.o is linked to both losetup and mount binaries, so losetup should
work equally well as mount.


SUMMARY TO LINUX-CRYPTO ARCHIVES:
Waldemar la Tendresse's problems mounting SuSE loop_fish2 encrypted
partition with loop-AES+ciphers packages were indeed caused by buggy code
and even more buggy README instructions. If someone needs to be blamed for
them, blame me, I am guilty.

Problem was that SuSE twofish encrypts loop devices with unusual 160 bit key
length, and there was no clean way to set up loop with that key length and
also setting cipher module to SuSE compatible mode. That silly one line
patch that I posted here on Thursday 16 Jan 2003 21:46:03 +0200 fixed that
incompatibility.

New version of util-linux patch (with twofish160 fix included) here:
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/updates/2003-01-18/loop-AES/util-linux-2.11y.diff.bz2
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/updates/2003-01-18/loop-AES/util-linux-2.11y.diff.bz2.sign

And updated ciphers-README file here:

</body></email><email><emailId>20030126234405</emailId><senderName>"Brenton D. Rothchild"</senderName><senderEmail>brothchild@dstorage.com</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2003-01-26 23:44:05-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Implementation Question</subject><body>

Hello,

I'm trying to implement a simple example kernel module
that uses encryption.

I'm having trouble in the fact that unless I decrypt a string
immediately after I've encrypted it (meaning I can't encrypt
two strings and then go back and decrypt the first string), the
last (length % 16) bytes are not decrypted properly.

An example is:
This works:
1) Encrypt "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234" -&gt; encrypted string
2) Decrypt encrypted string -&gt; "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234"

This doesn't work:
1) Encrypt "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234" -&gt; encrypted string
2) ... do some other encryptions of other strings ...
3) Decrypt encrypted string -&gt; "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx......." 
where "......." is a constant, but incorrect character string.

I've checked byte for byte the encrypted strings, and in every
case they are identical.

I'm using aes-ecb to avoid any complications with IVs.  I've tried
ensuring that my input/output buffer to ci-&gt;encrypt/decrypt is a
zero-padded buffer with length that is a multiple of 16.

I've also ignored the 'memset(cx-&gt;iv, 0, cx-&gt;ci-&gt;ivsize)' since
ivsize is zero for aes-ecb (at least I think so - someone correct
me if I'm wrong?)

Am I missing something, perhaps not clearing some state in the 
cipher_context or cipher_implementation structs?  Or not setting
a state?  Will I need to use IV (which I have little clue on using :p)?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!
-Brenton Rothchild

Dear sir/madam,                                    

Compliment of the day, I am JAMES KYARI, The son of late General Kubwa Kyari of the \
Democratic Republic of Congo. 

My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) with the \
office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent Kabila, he was assigned on a \
secret mission to source and acquire arms internationally in order to strengthen the \
Government forces against the rebels, which already had the support of Rwandan and \
Uganda Army.

Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the \
16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call \
off the assignment and deposited the sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in \
a private security company in the Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the \
content as precious stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase \
of arms for the Congolese Army.

My father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on his arrival he was \
arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my father suffer cardiac arrest and \
died on the 17th of March 2001. However, on one of our numerous visits, my mother and \
I paid him while in prison, my father was able to reveal this secret to me and advice \
that i should proceed to the Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the \
relevant documents that will enable me claim the box from the security \
company.Already, I have made my first visit to the security company and the \
availability of this box have been confirmed.

On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for political asylum; \
which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort on the best way to \
handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek \
for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom this money could be transferred into \
his/her (company"s) account. This we view as the best option because our refugee \
status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance \
and hope you could be trusted.

I got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in Belgium. \
Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your \
account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the total sum, 5% will be use for \
upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of concluding this venture and the \
remaining 70% that will be for me and my family. Also you stand to gain from any \
investment you might introduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.

Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your account \
for security reasons. 

This is my e-mail address you can reach me:(jameskyari1@netscape.net) 

Thanks and GOD bless. 

MR, JAMES KYARI.

&gt; ...and I greatly appreciate your efforts so far.  It's interesting that
&gt; your first patch worked as well as it did (at least for lockups...I haven't
&gt; run any speed tests on it).

OK, processes stuck in 'D' state problem has been solved in loop-AES-v1.7b

Here is what happened: VM in some rare occasions called loop driver
make_request function with process state set to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE when it
should have been set to TASK_RUNNING. Loop driver then called function that
had code like this:

    if(current-&gt;need_resched)
            schedule();

Above code provides low latency scheduling by calling schedule() when
scheduler has indicated that a process should give up control of CPU. Guess
what happens when schedule() is called with process state set to
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and no-one to wake up the process... process would
deadlock until it received some signal that would wake it up.

It is pretty crappy for VM to do that, but it is also unacceptable for loop
driver to not handle that kind of crap correctly. Fix is to add
"set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);" to beginning of loop_make_request().
Other elevator bugs fixed in fix-pausing-2h patch posted earlier are also
real bugs, but they weren't responsible for these deadlocks.

Like I said above, this bug is fixed in loop-AES-v1.7b. Below is one line
fix for older kernel patch versions. I have CC'd some people who may be
interested in merging this fix to code they maintain.

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Removed struct loop_device delayed allocation optimization from
  loop.c-2.5.patched because 2.5.58 needs a queue at add_disk() time.
- Modified Makefile to link with init/vermagic.o on 2.5 kernels.
- Added twofish160 encryption identifier to util-linux patch.
- Fixed bug that caused processes to be stuck in 'D' state in some rare
  circumstances (2.4 and 2.5 kernels). This bug is present in loop-AES
  versions v1.6b to v1.7a. Special thanks to Zygo Blaxell for bug hunting
  and testing.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I just compiled the loop device under the Linux
&gt; machine  whose version is 2.4.18. Do I need to any
&gt; other configuration?

Is the kernel tree you used for compilation configured *exactly* like
that one on the target box? Eg. did you copy the .config file, 'make
oldconfig'?

MfG, JBG
