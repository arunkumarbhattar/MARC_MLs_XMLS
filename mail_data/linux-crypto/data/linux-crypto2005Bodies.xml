Greetings,

now i have time to take a closer lock on loop-aes and try to encrypt my 
home-partition using it.
At first, I did some rtfm but I didn't understand it completely.
In nearly every multi-key example a keyfile with 65 keys is used. Why do you 
use exactly 65 keys?
Every example I see in the docs uses AES128. Is there a reason not to use 
AES256? (Of cource AES-128 will be secure for some time, but this is a reason 
pro aes-128 and not against aes-256, because AES-256 is also for some time ;)
Example 2 uses a lot of head / tail stuff to manipulate the /dev/urandom 
output. Why do I need this?

Keep smiling
yanosz

Hi.
I am new to this list and have a question. I am experimenting with a
encrypted archive on DVD. I use losetup, twofish-256 and cryptoloop to
encrypt a partition on my hard drive and it works ok.

I would like to somehow enrypt backups that are put on DVD-ROM. My current
two solutions are:
making a big (about 4 GB) container file and mount it with cryptoloop. Then
put the Data in it, unmount it and put it on DVD. Works ok, except I cannot
mount the file when it is on DVD. I have to copy the whole 4 GB container on
HDD to get just one of the files that are in it. If I try to mount directly
from DVD, I get an error, that I have no rights (I figure, losetup or mount
somehow need a theoretical write access to the container, even if it is
mountet as ro).
My question: why does loop not accept a file on DVD as input??? and is there
a way around?

The other solution is almost the same, except I use the container file as
ISO image for making a DVD. I can actually mount the whole device CDROM0 as
encrypted then. Works ok in a sense that I can access files from DVD
directly. The drawback seems to be however, that I frequently have errors in
my files (read/write errors). I did not have that with the container file.
The errors are usually in the last file, but somethimes almost half the
files are damaged (each file having about 200 MB)!
My question: Why are those errors happening??? and how can I avoid them?
(Does the error correction on DVD not work anymore when I use a
crypto-container as DVD-Image?)

Is cryptoloop at all a good mehtod of making an encrypted archive or should
I rather make tar's and run them through GPGP and then put them on a
DVD-ROM? (Regaring that I want to access these files maybe in quite some
time from now)

Thanks a lot
Ciao

A few months ago I set up a few systems with loop-aes and everything work
very smoothly.  Today I was attempting to setup a new system with the latest
and greatest and I am having trouble getting the patched GnuPG to compile
and build properly.

I started with a FC3 install and have already updated the kernel to 2.6.10
according to the loop-aes readme.  Everything has gone smoothly so far until
I downloaded GnuPG 1.4 and tried to get it to compile and build.

After issuing the make command, things go well for a little bit and then I
get the following:

If I run configure with LDFLAGS="-s" instead of LDFLAGS="-static -s"
everything works but since I won't have a statically linked GPG that's not
so good.

BTW, I checked and my install versions of readline and readline-devel are at
version 5.0.2

Any ideas?

Hi all!

I've been spending several hours looking at ways to encrypt my computer.
I've read the Disc Encryption HOWTO and loop-aes readme but can't find
any information about how to partition up a loopback device with
partitions larger than 2GB. I have understood this should be easier with
kernel 2.6 but don't know anything more about it.

Are there any comprehensive guides on partitioning a to be encrypted
loopback device (device backed)? Or does anyone have any other tips?

For the record all I really want is a disc that is 100% totally
encrypted no partition tables showing or anything.

loop-AES has supported 64 bit device offsets and sizelimits since November

You can use unpartitioned device /dev/hda and set up loop devices using
offset and sizelimit. If 'sfdisk -l -uS /dev/hda' says:

Units = sectors of 512 bytes, counting from 0
   Device Boot    Start       End  #sectors  Id  System
/dev/hda1   *        63     48194     48132  83  Linux
/dev/hda2         48195  11245499  11197305  83  Linux
/dev/hda3      11245500  12273659   1028160  82  Linux swap

And if you were to set up above three partitions as encrypted loop devices,
then you could issue these losetup commands:

losetup -e AES128 -K foo1.gpg -o @32256      -s 24643584   /dev/loop1 /dev/hda
losetup -e AES128 -K foo2.gpg -o @24675840   -s 5733020160 /dev/loop2 /dev/hda
losetup -e AES128 -K foo3.gpg -o @5757696000 -s 526417920  /dev/loop3 /dev/hda

Offset and sizelimit need to be specied in bytes. Offset is partition start
* 512, and sizelimit is #sectors * 512. The @ character in front of offset
is needed to remove the offset from IV computations.

For encrypted root, you can specify -o and -s losetup options to
build-initrd.sh script if you redefine the meaning of PSEED option.
Like this:

CRYPTROOT=/dev/hda
PSEED="-o @32256 -s 24643584"

Normal file system mounts can use offset= and sizelimit= mount options in
/etc/fstab file. Mount program understands them, but swapon program does
not. So, for partition-table-less encrypted swap you must use losetup
program with -o and -s options.

Thanks for your help..

Could I just ask why you gave different keys for each device?

Oh and why is the first partition starting at sector 63?

&gt; 
&gt; Offset and sizelimit need to be specied in bytes. Offset is partition
&gt; start * 512, and sizelimit is #sectors * 512. The @ character in front
&gt; of offset is needed to remove the offset from IV computations.
&gt; 
&gt; For encrypted root, you can specify -o and -s losetup options to
&gt; build-initrd.sh script if you redefine the meaning of PSEED option.
&gt; Like this:
&gt; 
&gt; CRYPTROOT=/dev/hda
&gt; PSEED="-o @32256 -s 24643584"
&gt; 
&gt; Normal file system mounts can use offset= and sizelimit= mount options
&gt; in /etc/fstab file. Mount program understands them, but swapon program
&gt; does not. So, for partition-table-less encrypted swap you must use
&gt; losetup program with -o and -s options.

&gt; Could I just ask why you gave different keys for each device?

Because that provides better protection against identical ciphertexts.
Identical ciphertexts using same encryption key are bad because they leak
information.

When sector data is encrypted or decrypted, position information within a
partition or device is used in IV computation and in multi-key mode to also
to select the encryption key. This provides reasonable guarantee that when
same data is written to more than one sectors, ciphertexts will be different
and attacker observing ciphertexts can't find out what plaintext sectors
contain identical data. If same key file is used to encrypt more than one
file system, there is a danger that same data + same encryption key + same
position info will result in identical ciphertexts.

Examples:
(A) losetup -e AES128 -K foo1.gpg /dev/loop1 /dev/hda1
(B) losetup -e AES128 -K foo2.gpg /dev/loop2 /dev/hda2
(C) losetup -e AES128 -K foo3.gpg /dev/loop3 /dev/hda3
(D) losetup -e AES128 -K foo1.gpg -o @32256      -s 24643584   /dev/loop1 /dev/hda
(E) losetup -e AES128 -K foo2.gpg -o @24675840   -s 5733020160 /dev/loop2 /dev/hda
(F) losetup -e AES128 -K foo3.gpg -o @5757696000 -s 526417920  /dev/loop3 /dev/hda
(G) losetup -e AES128 -K foo1.gpg -o 32256      -s 24643584   /dev/loop1 /dev/hda
(H) losetup -e AES128 -K foo2.gpg -o 24675840   -s 5733020160 /dev/loop2 /dev/hda
(I) losetup -e AES128 -K foo3.gpg -o 5757696000 -s 526417920  /dev/loop3 /dev/hda

In examples (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F), first loop device sector is
encrypted using position info 0, second sector using position info 512,
third sector using position info 1024, and so on. In example (G) first loop
device sector is encrypted using position info 32256, second sector using
position info 32256+512, third sector using position info 32256+1024, and so
on. In example (H) first loop device sector is encrypted using position info
24675840, second sector using position info 24675840+512, third sector using
position info 24675840+1024, and so on. In example (I) first loop device
sector is encrypted using position info 5757696000, second sector using
position info 5757696000+512, third sector using position info
5757696000+1024, and so on.

Examples (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) must use different key files to
avoid identical ciphertexts. Examples (G), (H), and (I) can use same key
file because they never use same position info for IV computation.

&gt; Oh and why is the first partition starting at sector 63?

Because I losetup'ed file systems that were originally created as
partitions, but this time using partitionless full device. Most disk
partitioning software that uses MSDOS style partitions leaves first track
of first cylinder as unused. That is because the Master-Boot-Record and
partition table are in first sector of first cylinder.

I see from the loop-aes README that to upgrade to a
newer version you first remove the old loop.o with
rmmod.

I'm running a Knoppix-based livecd distro all from
RAM, so the existing out-of-date (loop-aes v1.6i-1)
loop.o module is in two places:

/KNOPPIX/lib/modules/2.4.26/kernel/drivers/block/loop.o

and

/ramdisk/lib/modules/2.4.26/kernel/drivers/block/loop.o

Presumably I can remove the live one in ramspace and
compile &amp; install an updated loop.o on the ramdisk,
which will then work until it is lost when I reboot?

But rmmod loop.o says the "module is not loaded". (?)

Oops sorry - I realised 2 seconds after posting that
the ramdisk loop.o is a SYMLINK (of course) to the one
on KNOPPIX.

I suppose this means I have to remaster the livecd to
upgrade (but presumably do not have to recompile the
kernel?).

hi!

I don't know Knoppix at all. It depends on the kernel if you have to recompile 
it. It all depends whether the kernel was compiled with it's own loop device. 
Further it must be able to load modules - meaning CONFIG_MODULES=y and 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n. I would assume, since the old version worked, that you 
don't have to do that. Just make sure that the installed sources correspond 
to the kernel you're actually running.

In the loop-AES.README it says:

=======

(Re)configuring and (re)compiling your kernel are required for following
reasons: (1) to disable loop driver in your kernel, (2) to get your kernel
sources to match your running kernel, (3) to get your kernel .config to
match your running kernel, (4) to set up configure time generated links
properly, (5) to generate compile time created header files properly to
match your kernel configuration. Failure to fulfill *all* above requirements
may cause loop.o driver compilation to fail or generate incorrectly
operating code.

========

Cheers,

Ben

Ahh.. I see.

I was thinking in the lines of creating one big loopback device that
could then be "partitioned" using the offset and size parameters.
I think it would be quite nice if there could be no visible parts
outside the system. I have a feeling that creating loopback devices
directly from the hda would expose how big they are, which is not
desirable. Maybe this is true if you first encrypt the entire drive as
well.
 
losetup -e AES128 -K key.gpg -S &lt;seed&gt; -C 100 /dev/loop0 /dev/hda 
(Why does noone use AES256? Isn't that more secure? Is there a big speed
bump?)

losetup -o @32256-s 1003451904 /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0
losetup -o @1003484160 -s 1003451904 /dev/loop2/ /dev/loop0
losetup -o @2006936064 -s 5000937984 /dev/loop3/ /dev/loop0

I though something like the above. This might not be advisable though?

Hi!

I just saw what your talking about.
Well, to say it in short: If you do what Jari wrote, you will get what you
were asking for:-)
I was begging for the same some weeks ago. Using loop-aes there remains no
partition table or boot code on the harddrive. You have to start the PC from
usb-stick or cd-rom then.
Just do what Jari wrote, use the offsets to losetup. And calculate properly!

&gt; I was thinking in the lines of creating one big loopback device that
&gt; could then be "partitioned" using the offset and size parameters.

With regard to this, consider what your PC looks like when you installed a
Linux distro like SuSE or else. You have partitions. You must have them
because all distros will force you to set up some. So my proposal is you get
loop-aes and do what´s in the Readme. Example 7.7 is for you! When you
succeeded to boot your pc from USB-Stick then you can go on and remove the
mbr.
Big fat Warning:
Before erasing mbr like this:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
You have to *back up* the mbr to the usb-stick!!!!!!!
dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 &gt;/media/usb/mbr.img
Removing mbr with partition table is extremely dangerous for all your data!
That´s why it is not mentioned in the loop-aes readme! Dont´ complain if you
loose the entire data in case you make a little mistake. The usb-stick is
all you have, there will be your partition table and your keys. Just in case
you want to upgrade to a new version of your distro (let´s say SuSE 9.3) you
will want your partition table back.
dd if=/mnt/mbr.img of=/dev/hda
will do that.
I have tested it for weeks. It works fine with AES256 as well. It´s only a
matter of PC perfomance. You might also think about several layers of
encryption. Two layers of 128 bit encryption should be safer than one layer
with 256 bit as you can combine twofish, blowfish and aes on one partition.

For the time now, I would suggest you get loop-aes and try to bring your PC
in the state of example 7.7. When you successfully started from usb-stick
then you backup and remove the mbr. Jari told you how to do so. If you want
I can answer some questions, too.

Regards,
Peter

Great! 

I'll go with that version. Now I only have one problem.

I've already tried to set up encryption using 7.7 but even though my
running kernel has compiled in support for vfat I get an error message
telling me I don't. I've though of going with Disc Encryption HOWTO
instead and modify it to suit my needs. Jaris partioning and gpg keys
instead of the one in that document.

Is it a simple thing to add an extra layer of encryption or so after
you've encrypted your drive? Or should this be planned for in advance?

If you set up encrypted root using build-initrd.sh script from loop-AES
package and boot from USB-stick, then your hard disk will not have any info
where your partitions are and how big they are (Assuming that partition
table is erased).

The initrd boot from USB-stick will have plaintext info where and how big
your root partition is. Once you have booted to encrypted root, then init
scripts can set up the remaining encrypted "partitions" using losetup -o and
-s options. Init script reside on encrypted root so those offset+size infos
are not visible to attacker possessing "cold" disk.

Extra partition-table-less encrypted "partitions" can be automatically set
up like this in some init script that is run early in the boot process:

losetup -p 3 -e AES256 -o @32256    -s 24643584   /dev/loop1 /dev/hda 3&lt;/etc/fskey1.txt
losetup -p 3 -e AES256 -o @24675840 -s 5733020160 /dev/loop2 /dev/hda 3&lt;/etc/fskey2.txt

where /etc/fskey{1,2}.txt are text files containing 65 lines of random data,
preferably readable only by root user. Since these files reside on encrypted
root, they are always protected on "cold" disk.

&gt; losetup -e AES128 -K key.gpg -S &lt;seed&gt; -C 100 /dev/loop0 /dev/hda

gpg does salted and iterated key setup on its own, so those -S and -C
options are not needed here. In other words, -K option is mutually exclusive
with -S and -C options.

I'm sorry if I'm a big pain in the ass here but I really want to get
this done right. =)

I would really like to use the loop-aes way. 
However I'd prefer if I could format my usb as ext2 since I'm having
such problems with vfat detecting on my kernel.

However syslinux complains about that.
Is there any alternative?

I also can't find information about setting up with grub.
in DE HOWTO this is what happens:

title desktop
root (hd0.0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-desktop root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc desktop

How would that be handled with loop-aes way?

and what on earth shoul KBUILD_OUTPUT be set to when compiling loop.ko?

ext2 is not suitable for flash memory, because usually ext2 insist on
updating atime for reads. This causes unnecessary writes, and flash memories
usually have limited write cycles.

&gt; However syslinux complains about that.
&gt; Is there any alternative?

If I remember correctly, syslinux only works with VFAT/MSDOS file systems.

Dunno. Let me know if you can make it work using GRUB.

&gt; and what on earth shoul KBUILD_OUTPUT be set to when compiling loop.ko?

If your kernel sources are on same directory as object files, then
KBUILD_OUTPUT need not be set. If they are on different directories, then
KBUILD_OUTPUT must point to object directory.

If so I should be able to handle it without problem.
Hopefully.

The filesystem could be mounted with the noatime option. If you forget,
though, it would cause a fair amount of wear, like you say.

This /etc/lilo.conf is for hard disk boot to encrypted root, so this may be
useless for USB-stick boot.

&gt; Another question.
&gt; Is it a simple thing to add an extra layer of encryption or so after

So far I didn´t set up encrypted root with more than 1 layer. I made a
successfull test with another harddisk and 2 layers some time ago. It works
but you will use as much keys as you use layers and you will have to build
the modules for additions ciphers. For multilayer encrypted root you have to
load these modules from usb-stick before booting the pc!
So I suggest you get the thing with the usb-stick done first. Then Jari
might give us detailed info on how to build an initrd that loads several
modules and mounts encrypted root.

About booting from USB-Sticks:
Not all mainboard BIOSes support that kind of gimmick.
Not all manufacturers guarantee you that their sticks can be booted from.
Using syslinux is the easiest way to get it done. You don´t need to
configure something. Just type syslinux /dev/sda and your done.
If you insist on grub or else, please go here and read:
http://spblinux.ch.vu/
In case you are successfull with Grub on usb-sticks I´d like to hear from
you about that!
In case you never compiled a kernel I´d propose you try Linux Suse and the
standard kernel. Only make those changes mentioned in loop-aes readme.
And don´t start with thinking about several layers of encryption. The
examples of the loop-aes readme can be combined. You start with the distro
of your choice and encrypt more and more parts of it. Step by step, as much
as you deem usefull.
In case you find any other software that boots a PC with no partition table
on installed disks, please let me know.

Peter

I've stumbled upon a problem that I didn't think would appear.

For some reason losetup complains that I haven't got AES in kernel which
I know is a lie.
I've tried recompiling my kernel several times.
I've recompiled loop-aes several times
I've tried debians loop-aes-utils
I've compiled it like the README does it.

The odd thing is it worked just a day or so ago.
Could it have something to do with my installing 2.6.11 instead of
2.6.8?

This is my command and error.
# losetup -e AES256 -K key.gpg /dev/loop7 runner 

ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument, requested cipher or key length
(256 bits) not supported by kernel

When trying to mount the loop module built by loop-aes I get another
error.

FATAL: Error inserting loop (/lib/modules/2.6.11.6/block/loop.ko):
Input/output error

It also complains about some major 7 thing so I'm thinking this might
have something to do with aliasing even though it says in the tutorial
you shouldn't need to alias.

# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set
CONFIG_CRYPTO=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_TWOFISH=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_586=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST=y

What is happening here?

Above means that loop driver does not support crypto.

Above means that there is already a loop driver in your kernel.

Most likely you booted wrong kernel image.

Hi!

Me again. I've gotten half way through the tutorial and found something
that made me unsure.

In 7.7.10a it says you should set CRYPTROOT to /dev/hda2
How is this?

I'm going to wipe my entire drive and set up it all using losetup 
so what is CRYPTROOT for?

it's because dvd-rom uses 4096-byte blocksizes, while hard drives use

loop-aes could possibly break up 4096 byte blocks into 512 byte in order 
so that crypto would transparently work across devices with different 
block sizes... but afaik it doesnt currently do this.

&gt;I have been quite successful at doing this, I make a file backed up
&gt;image of an ext2 filesystem, which I can mount, fill with files, close
&gt;and then write directly to the DVD (as a stream, not as an iso image).
&gt;Then I can mount the DVD the same way, and read the individual files
&gt;from it.

What is the difference of writing it "as a stream" or as an ISO? I do not
know how to write a DVD as a stream. I have only one DVD-Writer and it is in
a Windows-PC, so I use Nero to burn the image file... I can use either ISO
or Data Mode 1 with 2048 Blocksize. Both will work, but both have those
errors I mentioned in some files.
How do I write a stream? What parameters do I have to choose when doing
that?

&gt;The relevant bits in fstab are:
&gt;
&gt;/somewhere/cdvdimage	/someplace/CDVDimage	ext2\
&gt; defaults,noauto,user,loop=/dev/loop3,encryption=AES128,\
&gt; itercountk=100,pseed=SomeJunk 0 0

Ok, mine is similar. I use twofish-256 though and I do not know what
itercountk and pseed means. Maybe it is something that is needed by AES? You
use AES-loop and not cryptoloop?

&gt;I made sure to format the image file with a suitably large blocksize.

What block size do I need? Can you give me the command line how to make a
good image file? I used "dd /dev/zero FILE bs=2048 count=&lt;something to make
it 4 GB&gt;" and then "losetup -e twofish-256 /dev/loop7 FILE" and then
"mke2fs -j /dev/loop7", although I guess the -j is useless for a ro-device?

&gt;I am very skeptical about how readable my DVDs will be after some years,
&gt;but I haven't had one fail yet. I certainly don't get many errors.

Hmmm - Maybe it is a hardware error that makes those errors. I will try a
different DVD-ROM. I need to make a backup of my root-system without /home
so I can open these DVDs later even if I need to use a Virtual Machine and
put the backup into is...

&gt;Hope that's helpful,&lt;&lt;

Thanks a lot, but so far, you seem to be doing almost the same as I did.
Except for the things I mentioned above. MAybe if you could tell me more
about these, I can sort out the problem. But then - maybe it really is a
hardware problem.

Ciao

What you want is aespipe. Look at

read such encrypted images even if they are made on 4,4GB DVD 
under Nero. 
In case you would install loop-aes plus aespipe it might be 
possible to append proper settings to the example especially for 
DVD images. 
Try aespipe and aks if you have questions on that. 
I can assure you that it works.

To write it as a stream I used 
growisofs -Z /dev/scd0=/image/file
This is on a DVD +R medium, in Linux. I don't know whether Nero under
Windows will do that. It seems to me that it's almost like using dd to
copy the data.

2048 was the block size I used too.

You're right, I am using loop-aes, pseed and itercount are just to make
the thing less vulnerable to a precomputed pasword guess attack, I
think. They're not needed to make it work.

Good Luck,
Paul Hilton

&gt; 
&gt; What is the difference of writing it "as a stream" or as an ISO? I do not
&gt; know how to write a DVD as a stream. I have only one DVD-Writer and it is in
&gt; a Windows-PC, so I use Nero to burn the image file... I can use either ISO
&gt; or Data Mode 1 with 2048 Blocksize. Both will work, but both have those
&gt; errors I mentioned in some files.
&gt; How do I write a stream? What parameters do I have to choose when doing
&gt; that?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The relevant bits in fstab are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;/somewhere/cdvdimage	/someplace/CDVDimage	ext2\
&gt; &gt; defaults,noauto,user,loop=/dev/loop3,encryption=AES128,\
&gt; &gt; itercountk=100,pseed=SomeJunk 0 0
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, mine is similar. I use twofish-256 though and I do not know what
&gt; itercountk and pseed means. Maybe it is something that is needed by AES? You
&gt; use AES-loop and not cryptoloop?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I made sure to format the image file with a suitably large blocksize.
&gt; 
&gt; What block size do I need? Can you give me the command line how to make a
&gt; good image file? I used "dd /dev/zero FILE bs=2048 count=&lt;something to make
&gt; it 4 GB&gt;" and then "losetup -e twofish-256 /dev/loop7 FILE" and then
&gt; "mke2fs -j /dev/loop7", although I guess the -j is useless for a ro-device?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I am very skeptical about how readable my DVDs will be after some years,
&gt; &gt;but I haven't had one fail yet. I certainly don't get many errors.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm - Maybe it is a hardware error that makes those errors. I will try a
&gt; different DVD-ROM. I need to make a backup of my root-system without /home
&gt; so I can open these DVDs later even if I need to use a Virtual Machine and
&gt; put the backup into is...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hope that's helpful,&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot, but so far, you seem to be doing almost the same as I did.
&gt; Except for the things I mentioned above. MAybe if you could tell me more
&gt; about these, I can sort out the problem. But then - maybe it really is a
&gt; hardware problem.

Peter,
I did use aespipe for formatting the image in the first place, worked
fine, but now I have it it's easier to just mount the image, and setup
the files exactly as they will look when I mount the CD/DVD.

I have read the readme. it sounds all right, although I do not get, why and
how I have to "create 65 random encryption keys and encrypt those keys using
gpg". Up to now, I never needed a keyfile, just the password-sentence, so
I'm a bit lost on how and why this is done.

My concern about usinf loop-aes is, that it may change my current settings
for cryptoloop, losetup,...etc. Will it change these? If so, I might not be
able to use my old archives any longer, if the new cryptoloop/losetup
modules are not compatible...
Actually I wanted a twofish-encryption, since I read, that AES is not really
the best anymore and has weaknesses, but I guess before it won't work at all
(or just by using large container files).

Oh yes - what exactly is the difference between an image-file made with
aespipe and one made with losetup? The real question beeing - what is the
advantage of this. to me it seems like aespipe is making basically the same
as losetup, so the ISO-image is looking similar. Although I see the
difference in filesystem. I used ext2 and the readme uses mkisofs. May that
be the key to success?

&gt;To write it as a stream I used
growisofs -Z /dev/scd0=/image/file&lt;&lt;

ok, so that is a cd-rom-burner program, right? I can't use that unless I use
a virtual machine under windows

&gt;2048 was the block size I used too.&lt;&lt;

How big are your image files? I noticed, that when I use a bs of 2048 (in
Nero), there will be a warning that the disk is too small whenever I use an
image file that is larger than about 4 GB. What happens to the remaining 0.7
GB on the DVD? (the DVDs claim to have 4.7 GB) Is it used for
error-correction? May it be, that error-correction does not work because I
use an image file that appears to contain "garbage".

Sounds like it. CDROMs use the iso9660 filesystem.

As we all know CDROMs use iso9660 fs. That wasn´t the question... 
For encrypting CDROMs with loop-aes just do what´s in the 
aespipe.readme. The example works fine. 
My interest is rather encrypting DVDs. CDs are very tiny. So far 
I used the aespipe example also for DVDs. It works but it has 
some nasty probs. Due to the encryption the DVD drive sometimes 
doesn´t find a medium. I had do re-insert the DVD disk. Other 
probs can occur when there are 5000 or much more files in one 
single folder. There is space enough for some 30 000 .jpgs on a 
single DVD. Sometimes not all images can be read or the directory 
properly browsed. 
So far I have no idea from what theses ugly latches come from. It 
might be a question of block size. Maybe it is because I used 
cheap DVDs. All in all, aespipe *is* capable of creating 
encrypted ISO images for DVDs. There fit 4.4GB on one disk. You 
can either do the aespipe example and store the key on that disk 
or modify the example and store the key on other media. 
So far I don´t know if all the space should be used and what will 
happen if a DVD is over-burned. I wouldn´t use ext2 or 3 on 
CD/DVD. What should a journal be good for on a read-only medium? 
Furthermore there would be the possibility to access those 
encrypted disks also under Windows. For that someone has to 
publish a driver for loop-aes under a Windows environment. 
Btw. building encrypted containers and storing them on DVD isn´t 
a good idea. You need to use udf for all files exceeding 2GB. The 
examples from aespipe are definitely the right choice.

Peter

I have managed both a small overburn, and any amount of underburn, now I
just keep burning the same image file with different files on it. I have
my doubts about the security of this, as any space that is not rewritten
between burns will have the same data on it, that would certainly tell
someone about the size of the data written, and might provide other
avenues of attack.

The reason I used ext2 (which I don't think is journalled afaik) was
it's ability to support all the filenames and directory depths that I
might find on the volume I an writing to DVD. As pointed out
compatibility with Windows is out anyway until loop-aes is available
there. Also it can handle symbolic links, I'm not sure that they would
be OK with iso9660.

BTW, does anyone know of a way of making symbolic links to volumes that
are offline that when you try to open them run some external program to
cause the volume to be mounted? That way I could keep all the
directories of backed up stuff available, with just access to the data
requiring a volume to be mounted.

Paul Hilton

can either do the aespipe example and store the key on that disk
or modify the example and store the key on other media. &lt;&lt;

Isn't it VERY risky to store the key on the disk as in the example? I mean -
Jari mentioned, that cryptoloop is vulnerable because it has no key and uses
the password directly for encryption. But if I store the key on the same
media as the data it would mean that anyone trying to decrypt the data gets
the key also - in that case it would be as vulnerable as the cryptoloop,
right?

&gt;So you care about security? Then why are you using the most broken and

Well - I use a Pass-sentence of several words and numbers, so I was hoping
that it is too complicated to figure out with a dictionary attack. Also, the
AES-Loop example for making a CD-ROM stores the key on the CD which I think
would mean, that there is no difference between the two systems, is there?
(Besides - does Loop-AES have 256b as twofish or only 128b?)

And I had another question still unanswered: will installing Loop-AES
destroy my losetup/cryptoloop installation? If so, I'd have to copy about 20
DVDs on HDD and make them again, since I don't want to loose the
(cryptoloop-saved) data on them

The key file is gpg encrypted. gpg does proper salted+iterated key setup

Whether or not to store the key file with the data is a matter of 
taste. To me that tastes strange so I decided to store keyfile 
elsewhere. 
The question still remains: 
fdisk -l /dev/hda 
Note: sector size is 2048 (not 512) 
 
Disk /dev/hda: 4530 MB, 4530241536 bytes 
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 137 cylinders 
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 2048 = 32901120 bytes 
 
Disk /dev/hda doesn't contain a valid partition table 
 
What is now the right mastering process for encrypted DVDs? Does 
the aespipe example for encrypted CDROM also apply to DVDs? Or 
came the hang ups when reading from encrypted DVD from improper 
mastering of the ISO?

So you have experience in building encrypted DVDs? That´s what I 
am looking for. Ok, ISO9660 will not allow all that ext2/3 does. 
As I only use the DVDs for backup there is no need for dozens of 
subdirs. I´d be interested to know how you actually master the 
images. You don´t use mkisofs, do you? I´m looking for the right 
way to create ISO9660 images than can be burned on DVD. 
The question is how much data fits on DVD? 4.0 or 4.4GB? I don´t 
want the key to be stored with the data on DVD. My testing has 
shown hang ups on very full directories. Sometimes seeks failed 
and such. It might be a matter of bad media quality or unsuitable 
mastering. 
In brief, I build up directory tree, called mkisofs -r and piped 
the iso through aespipe. Output can than be burned to DVD with 
Nero or k3b. Jari uses a 8192 byte section on beginning of CDROM 
to store the key and some zeroes. I store the key elsewhere. 
Maybe the missing free space is the cause for the lock ups? 
I´m interested in concrete examples.

#dd if=/dev/urandom of=/image/file bs=4k count=1147460 \
  conv=notrunc 2&gt;/dev/null

I mount it to a loop device
#losetup -e AES128 -C 100 -S arandomlygeneratedseed -T \
  /dev/loop3 /image/file

I format it (in your case you probably want iso9660)
#mke2fs -b 2048 -m 0 /dev/loop3

I unloop it
#losetup -d /dev/loop3

I put an entries in fstab for it like:
/image/file  /mounted/location  ext2 \ 
  defaults,noauto,user,loop=/dev/loop3,encryption=AES128,\
  itercountk=100,pseed=thesamerandomlygeneratedseed 0 0
/dev/scd0  /mounted/location  ext2 \ 
  defaults,noauto,user,loop=/dev/loop3,encryption=AES128,\
  itercountk=100,pseed=thesamerandomlygeneratedseed 0 0

Then I mount it as the backup user
$mount /image/file

Then I fill it up with files

Then I unmount it
$umount /image/file

Then I write it to dvd
growisofs -Z /dev/scd0=/image/file

Note that whatever the file system is it won't be recognized 
by most DVD burning software, it looks like a random data stream.
I couldn't get K3b to do it, even though K3b uses growisofs to do
the actual writing, as it rejected it as an invalid image.

Then I mount the DVD
$mount /dev/scd0

Then I can read it from /mounted/location

It works fine for me.


&gt;  
&gt; The question is how much data fits on DVD? 4.0 or 4.4GB? 

4,700,000,000 Bytes without overburn, about 4.4GB, my current images are
4699996160 bytes.

&gt; I don´t want the key to be stored with the data on DVD.
I don't use the multikey mode because I don't have, and don't want,
encrypted swap, and it is my understanding that gpg can leak the content
of what it encrypts to swap.

&gt; My testing has 
&gt; shown hang ups on very full directories. Sometimes seeks failed 
&gt; and such. It might be a matter of bad media quality or unsuitable 
&gt; mastering. 
I've never had such problems.

&gt; In brief, I build up directory tree, called mkisofs -r and piped 
&gt; the iso through aespipe. Output can than be burned to DVD with 
&gt; Nero or k3b. Jari uses a 8192 byte section on beginning of CDROM 
&gt; to store the key and some zeroes. I store the key elsewhere. 
&gt; Maybe the missing free space is the cause for the lock ups? 
&gt; I´m interested in concrete examples. 
See above.

Paul Hilton

I hope you are not using the same key file to encrypt multiple DVDs.
Re-using same key file for more than one file system will lead to identical
ciphertexts. Identical ciphertexts leak information.

Take a look what kind of information gets written to swap: ssh sessions,

don't want that kind of info recorded in non-volatile storage on disk.

Swap is one of the worst anti-security features ever conceived. Encrypted
swap solves that problem nicely.

I am using the same single key for multiple DVDs, and I am aware that
this will result in repeated copies of any stuff not unique to the data
volume (non overwritten space etc.) This is because I reuse the same
image file for each DVD, but with different relevant data content.
How much information does this leak? Obviously the attacker will know
the extent to which I've rewritten the data between two disks, not a
problem of itself. I would assume that I'm vulnerable to a known
plaintext attack, and what matters to me is the privacy of
the other information on the disk and other disks encrypted with the
same single key. Whatever happens I'm not going to have a different 
pass phrase for each disk.

Does the watermark attack allow an attacker to do more than identify that

which case in my application that's not too serious.

Good point, how much will encrypted swap slow down what seems to require
the fastest performance I can get? I'll read your excellent readme again 
which I'm sure covers it.

Each file system with unique key file and same passphrase are ok.

Watermark present or watermark not-present info is leaked.

If same key file is used for multiple partitions, then adversary can easily

because sector number is used in IV computation, and sector number is
guaranteed to be unique on one file system.

&gt; But you are not concerned that an attacker may find the key to the data in

Storing key file somewhere else improves security, but re-using same key

&gt; 3.3. Example 3 - Encrypted DVD-R
[snip]
&gt; What would you say about this?

Ok for one DVD. Not ok for two or more DVDs.

&gt; Will that dvd lock-up again when opening one of its folders containing

&gt; disk and such?

Lockups with 30k files on one directory sound more like file system
implementation bug.

Wouldn't this be negated by the fact that you're initialising the 
storage space for the ISO with /dev/urandom?  This would be a fairly 
good guarantee that blank sectors (the most likely things to be 
identical) are going to still be different.  I thought ISO images 
wouldn't include any unused blocks, anyway, which would also mean that 
blank sectors would be irrelevant.

And therefore, if you're not writing identical files in identical 
locations, isn't the risk associated with reusing a set of keys reduced?

Another way of going about this might be to write a file from 
/dev/urandom at the size you want and set this up as an loop-AES file 
system.  Copy your files on and then unmount it.  Then copy this 
encrypted filesystem onto the disk.  When you want to access it, just 
use aespipe or loop-AES (not sure which, given the earlier argument 
about blocksizes) to open that file as a filesystem.  Why try to encrypt 
the ISO image at all?

Have fun,

Paul

I note that aespipe can encrypt a filesystem giving a
similar result to loop-aes (3.4 Example 4 from the
README). Compiling aespipe also doesn't require a
kernel rebuild (even I can do it!).

Why then continue to develop or use loop-aes? (Speed? Security?)

A script I'm writing to help me manage loop-aes v.2
partition-backed loops (a la README sect 7.2 Ex 2)
needs to be launched by a filemanager ie not from a
commandline.

In order for the terminal user to enter the passphrase
to encrypt the keyfile, I want to open an rxvt window
running gpg from the script (unless there's another
way).  Since the -e option to rxvt only seems to take
one command argument, I seem to be stuck with this:

mkfifo -m 600 npipe
head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 65
| tail -n 64 &gt;npipe &amp;
rxvt +sb -geometry 80x1 -fn fixed -cr blue  -T
"Password" -e gpg -c -a -o ${KEYFILE} npipe
wait
rm -f npipe

(Rxvt seems to accept no other workarounds that I can
find).

Is this much less secure than the usual anonymous
pipe?

Or, if an attacker was in a position to read from the
named pipe, does that mean they would be in a position
to easily compromise the encryption anyway (with or
without the named pipe)?

I considered making root the pipe owner to tighten
security on the named pipe but the user has sudo
rights anyway so why bother.

I've thought I could randomise the path and name of
the  named pipe to make it harder to watch for by
doing something (?) like:

r=$(((RANDOM%(99))/2))
NPIPENAME=$(head -c $RANDOM /dev/random| uuencode -m -
| head -n 2 | tail -n 1| cut -c -$r )# also add a sed
filter for bad chars except / 

But a trojan/intruder could still watch for new pipes
some other way, no doubt.

Help! Any comments or suggestions?

However ... I know people have raised it before but
isn't there a way of locking out the copious crap spam
on this mail list ...

Why not only allow subscribers to post to the list or
doesn't encartis do that?

Also, I usually subscribe to webboards etc using a
spamgourmet.com disposable address, so if that gets
sold, trawled or bombed it's no problem.  But encartis
would not let me subscribe to this list with a
spamgourmet account, and it's too easy to reassemble
my email address from posts.

Hello!

I have a question regarding the way I handle my encrypted drives. The scenario 
as it is right now:
My HDD ist AES256 encrypted and I have the gpg encoded key in a usb device. 
The fstab line looks like:

/dev/md0 /home xfs 
defaults,loop=/dev/loop1,encryption=AES256,gpgkey=/mnt/usb/raid_key.gpg 0 0

It prompts me for my gpg pwd and everything is fine. On the encrypted 
partition mentioned above, there are more keys in plain text for additional 
drives. What I'm trying to do is that once I unlock my main partition my 
additional drives get mounted using the keys on the previously unlocked 
drive. How do I specify a plaintext key location? Any ideas how the fstab 
line(s) ought to look like? Or maybe a completely different approach on how I 
can unlocked several drives with one pwd?!

Thanks alot

Ben

Hi all,

Does anyone else use loop-aes on Fedora Core 4?  I upgraded last week, 
and after installing loop-aes-v3.0d and building a new util-linux rpm, I 
cannot mount my encrypted filesystem.  I've been using loop-aes since 
the FC1 days without issue.  I'm using the following key and losetup:

$ wc -l keys
64 keys
$ cat keys | /sbin/losetup -p 0 -e AES128 /dev/loop3 /dev/hdb4

When I try to mount, I get:

$ mount /dev/loop3 /mnt/storage
mount: you must specify the filesystem type

e.g. somehow, it's not decrypting my partition properly.  It's 
definitely doing _something_, though:

$ head -c 60 /dev/hdb4 | hexdump
0000000 6560 3137 ae41 f075 911a 0592 3878 9a8d
0000010 bdc4 6f8a a2bb d69c c422 08af 0466 342e
0000020 838b b4fe dbdb 9827 74a0 15e6 c3f9 43f5
0000030 6f90 f9c3 5698 e25a 3fcd e43a

$ head -c 60 /dev/loop3 | hexdump
0000000 d816 cb3d 7c92 f1b9 b26b c58b 6c38 8338
0000010 a564 c7f4 1d23 5d2d 512b 2194 70e2 1b21
0000020 e08d a6bf b670 fa8e 1496 fc82 5590 d570
0000030 b47f b02a a758 3be0 e26f 4f2d

On the other hand, I have an encrypted filesystem on my USB stick which 
mounts fine, though it only uses 1 key (for compatability with CrossCrypt):

$ cat secure/key.unix.txt | gpg | wc -l
1

$ cat secure/key.unix.txt | gpg | /sbin/losetup -p 0 -e AES256 
/dev/loop2 secure/image.dat

Thanks,
Bill

I tried encrypted root on FC4. Worked ok for me.

One problem I encountered was that Fedora installer adds some silly mount
options to /etc/fstab file. Normal mount program does not understand them
and tries to pass those mount "options" to the kernel file system code. File
system code does not like them either, so it aborts the mount.

&gt; I upgraded last week, and after installing loop-aes-v3.0d and building a
&gt; new util-linux rpm, I cannot mount my encrypted filesystem.

Does "make tests" work on the loop-AES source directory? If there are
problems with key setup or such, that test script should report problem.

&gt; $ head -c 60 /dev/loop3 | hexdump
&gt; 0000000 d816 cb3d 7c92 f1b9 b26b c58b 6c38 8338
&gt; 0000010 a564 c7f4 1d23 5d2d 512b 2194 70e2 1b21

&gt; 0000030 b47f b02a a758 3be0 e26f 4f2d

Looks like random junk == bad key setup.

What does "losetup /dev/loop3" say? It should say "multi-key-v2" 

What does "strings -a /sbin/losetup | grep multi-key" say?

I applied the patch to gpg source and compiled as
recommended in the loop-AES.README.  Appears to work
ok.

Is there any easy way to tell if iteration actually
has been "slowed down by 128 times" ie that the
patched gpgp is working as it should?

".. On the other hand, I have an encrypted filesystem
on my USB stick which mounts fine, though it only uses
1 key (for compatability with CrossCrypt)..."

This reminded me: Crosscrypt hasn't been upgraded in
more than one year and the website looks untouched
(same typos).

While the Crosscrypt driver supports multi-line keys
it does not as yet support partition-backed loops,
which seriously reduces its utility as a
cross-platform (ie with linux) loop-aes implementation
because of the "lock-up" (system freeze) issues with
file-backed loops under linux. At the bottom of the
webpage however, the author seemed to indicate that
instructions for device-backed loops were coming.

While this is a Linux mail list, the ability to do
loop-aes loopback encryption under linux that is also
compatible with an implementation under Windows is,
without doubt, not a bad thing.

Are there any other cross-platform compatible
implementations under Windows?

Does anyone know if Crosscrypt might resume
development?

The Debian source for kernel 2.4.27 unpacks into
/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27 (that's what's available
debian-source-wise I think), but the running kernel
(precompiled, from the debian install cd) is (from
uname -r) 2.4.27-2-386 ie for i386 architecture.

So when I built loop.o, it got put in
/lib/modules/2.4.27/block

This didn't seem to be a problem, however.   I did
rmmod loop.o
rm -f
/lib/modules/2.4.27-2-386/kernel/drivers/block/loop.o
cp /lib/modules/2.4.27/block/loop.o
/lib/modules/2.4.27-2-386/kernel/drivers/block
modprobe loop

and the new loop.o driver seems to be working.

BUT this same procedure didn't work for the new
modules I built from loop-aes-ciphers v3.0b - modprobe
says it can't find them.

Naively changing the name of the source code directory
to match 2.4.26-2-386 doesn't work ( I didn't think it
would).

How to I fix this?

The loop-aes README is quite unambiguous about the
need to ensure that the kernel against which the
loop.o driver is built has been compiled "...so that
CONFIG_MODULES=y
and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n".  (The usual with
downloaded precompiled debian kernels would be
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=m). (As I have been attempting to
do)

But the following online guides to building loop-aes
on debian (using the .deb source packages not the
sourceforge tarballs) don't mention this at all, which
seems (?) to imply a kernel rebuild is not necessary
for their approaches, in fact it looks like they
simply rmmod the existing loop.o before loading the
new module with modprobe loop.

http://www.debian-administration.org/?article=81
http://deb.riseup.net/storage/encryption/loop-aes/

Is that the case, and, if so, why/how is it so ...?

Please disregard that post - copying the modules into
teh correct location DOES work I think, I was
modprobing eg 'loop_serpent' instead of just
'serpent'.

My apologies.

Though not entirely sure what I was doing, I tried
adding the following to modules.dep:

/lib/modules/2.4.27-2-386/kernel/drivers/block/loop_blowfish.o:

/lib/modules/2.4.27-2-386/kernel/drivers/block/loop_serpent.o:

/lib/modules/2.4.27-2-386/kernel/drivers/block/loop_twofish.o:

Modprobe then gave no errors, and `make tests` passed
AOK with "*** Test results ok ***"

Is this all ok then?

Hi Phil,

The location depends on the value for EXTRAVERSION that was set during
the kernel build. I guess your source tree hasn't been configured, or
you used an EXTRAVERSION different from that of the Debian kernel-image? 

In case you are using make-kpkg, you could try setting
--append-to-version -2-386.

This could be caused by outdated depmod information. Does it work

When building for "official" Debian kernels, I recommend to use
module-assistant to prepare a source tree that closely resembles
the original - including EXTRAVERSION etc. 

Just do "m-a fakesource" and build using the source tree in

No, that is not OK.

Makefile for loop-AES and ciphers packages run depmod program for you. You
should not need to modify modules.dep manually.

Your modules were compiled for wrong kernel source and/or wrong kernel
configuration. Although those modules may seem to work, I expect such
miscompiled modules to eventually fail. If you choose to use such modules,
don't bother reporting problems later.

Debian sid may have precompiled loop-AES + ciphers modules for debian
kernels. You just need to find and install correct packages.

&gt; you used an EXTRAVERSION different from that of the
&gt; Debian kernel-image? 

Thanks very much - this explains a lot. I've been
rebuilding kernels from 
http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/system/kernel-pkg.html
which doesn't bother mentioning things like
EXTRAVERSION, so I didn't set that at all. I just took
the .config file which came with the 2.4.27-2-386
running kernel, turned off loops under block devices,
and used that to rebuild from the 2.4.27 debian
source, then made an initrd and amended grub
accordingly.

I set --append-to-version to '.noloop' to
differentiate the new loopless kernel from the running
kernel.

&gt; In case you are using make-kpkg, you could try
&gt; setting
&gt; --append-to-version -2-386.
&gt; In case you are using make-kpkg, you could try
&gt; setting
&gt; --append-to-version -2-386.

Yep I'm using make-kpkg.  Err .. at the risk of being
a pain, how do I then differentiate the new kernel
from the running kernel if I set --append-to-version
-2-386 ?

&gt; Does it work 
&gt; after running depmod -a ?

Yes. Encrypted swap (aes128) appears to be working, as
does a device-backed loop encrypted with serpent.

&gt; When building for "official" Debian kernels, I
&gt; recommend to use
&gt; module-assistant to prepare a source tree that
&gt; closely resembles
&gt; the original - including EXTRAVERSION etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just do "m-a fakesource" and build using the source
&gt; tree in
&gt; /usr/src/kernel-source-$kvers-$debabi-$subarch

I'll try this.

&gt; ... if you suspect Debian specific problems.

It's newbie-specific problems I think ...

Thanks again for your help.

Apologies if this is a silly question, but you did realise that Debian's

loop-aes-ciphers-source, loop-aes-source, and loop-aes-utils. (Possibly also
aespipe.)

Me again.  I did the above - appeared to be
straightforward and got the faked sources as required
..but... my compiled loop.o doesn't work this time.

chown -R phil:phil /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.26-1-386
\

Copied the .config file for the working 2.4.26-1-386
kernel image into the newly-created
/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.26-1-386

Then:
cd /usr/src \
ln -s /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.26-1-386 linux \
cd linux \
make oldconfig \
make xconfig \ --&gt; switched off loops, floppy &amp; ide
'y'
Saved &amp; exit
fakeroot make-kpkg clean \
fakeroot make-kpkg --append-to-version=-noloop
kernel_image \
dpkg -i
kernel-image-2.4.26-1-386-noloop_10.00.Custom_i386.deb
\
Rebooted into new kernel - no problems thus far.

Built loop.o and patched utils as per readme. All
straightforward.

--&gt;New loop.o driver appeared in
/lib/modules/2.4.26-1-386/block

("noloop" gets chopped off new modules directory name)

Rebooted into original regular kernel 2.4.26-1-386
(which had CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=m in its .config)

buT THEN...

make tests fail --&gt; no device /dev/loop7

modprobe loop --&gt; spews a lot of errors looking like
this:

/lib/modules/2.4.26-1-386/block/loop.o:
/lib/modules/2.4.26-1-386/block/loop.o: unresolved
symbol blk_dev_Re7da9d9c

I'm sure this is something embarrassingly obvious but ...?

No problem at all bulding loop-aes for 2.4.27 from
debian sources (from sid) using method 4 of the
README.debian ie using official tree, headers and
image sources (see below). Works fine. 

But the `m-a fakesource` approach bombs out with a
'rule not found for somethingorother` message.

Is there something wrong with my module-assistant, or
do you really just need the actual sources the running
kernel was in fact built from?

You need only one of the method described in 4) or module-assistant
fakesource; If the method 4 works for you, there is no need to use
module-assistant fakesource and vice versa.

If you want to use module-assistant, what was the exact message it
returned? Please expand the "somethingorother" part.

&gt; do you really just need the actual sources the running
&gt; kernel was in fact built from?

Yes. The actual sources are fine.

BTW: please send Debian specific questions to the relevant places 
(debian-user list, BTS, me, etc.); I guess this is all not very
interesting nor relevant for most people on linux-crypto.

Well, Debian has indeed everything that's needed for loop-aes, but
it's not very well documented.

1) You need to get your kernel-headers _and_ kernel-source packages,
build-essential,  module-assistant, and all the usual development
packages
2) run "module-assistant fakesource" 
3) run "module-assistant a-i loop-aes"
4) apt-get install loop-aes-utils
5) be happy

Unfortunately Sarge has loop-aes module version 2.0 and loop-aes-utils
version 3.0, but Sid's loop-aes-source works on Sarge flawlessly

Jim

&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure this is something embarrassingly obvious
&gt; but ...?
&gt; 
Ah - I've worked out what was wrong!  I had deleted
the "linux" symlink in /usr/src before compiling
loop.o, and I didn't specify LINUX_SOURCE explicitly
as a "make" command switch.

My thanks for everybody's patience.  Not sure whether
the fault was one or both of these, but after re-doing
with the symlink back in and LINUX_SOURCE specified, I
now have a working loop.o on this kernel, without
doing any dubious manipulations.

One more thing though (sorry!):

The debian source came from www.backports.org and was 
kernel-source-2.4.26_2.4.26-6_all.deb.  In fact I was
actually looking for the deb source for the downloaded
kernel image from the same place, which was
kernel_image-2.4.26-1-386_2.4.26-5.backports.org.1_i386.deb
That kernel source was all that was there for 2.4.26. 
I posted to the backports mail list to check that I
did in fact have the right source, and was told that
this source did in fact pertain to my downloaded
kernel image, despite the fact that one has a "-5" and
the other a "-6" in the handles.  I didn't follow the
explanation as to why there were different numbers:
one had been rebuilt and the other hadn't been, or
something.

"fakesource" then created source code from this with
the directory name
/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.26-1-386.

But the kernel that actually runs from
kernel_image-2.4.26-1-386_2.4.26-5.backports.org.1_i386.deb
is (according to uname -r) 2.4.27-2-386 (note the
"2").

This led to a warning at the end of building
loop-aes-ciphers that the modules were built for
2.4.26-1-386 but the running kernel was 2.4.26-2-386
and that these wouldn't run (although they do).

How significant are these appended kernel build
numbers on the same version kernel, especially when
one or both numbers have been generated by
fakesource/backports?

Should I still be concerned? - all tests have been
passed so far.

If you decrypt a file that was encrypted using symmetric cipher only using
unpatched gpg, then debug output says count 96

$ gpg --decrypt -v -v &lt;symmetric-encrypted-file.gpg &gt;/dev/null
                ^^^^^

:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 7, s2k 3, hash 2

                               ^^^^^^^^        

But a file created using patched gpg says count 208

:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 9, s2k 3, hash 2
        salt b412e8ba16e3ece9, count 208
                               ^^^^^^^^^        
        
The salt is always unique for each file.

The important point is to *create* the key file using patched version. Both
unpatched and patched versions can decrypt the file by adapting to the count
that was recorded to gpg-encrypted file header.

Just in case you are wondering why those test key files used by loop-AES
"make tests" are encrypted using (unpatched) count 96. That is because of
speed. I wan't that script to run fast even on older hardware.

&gt; I tried encrypted root on FC4. Worked ok for me.

&gt; One problem I encountered was that Fedora installer adds some silly mount

&gt; and tries to pass those mount "options" to the kernel file system code. File
&gt; system code does not like them either, so it aborts the mount.

Did you use a clean copy of util-linux, or the patched version provided 
by FC4?  From your above comments, I'm guessing you used a clean copy...

I applied the patch provided in the loop-AES tarball to the FC4 SRPM.  I 
had to comment out the NFSv4 patches included in the FC4 SRPM in order 
to get it to apply, though.  Also, the patch provided by loop-AES-3.0d 
is for util-linux-2.12q, while Fedora includes util-linux-2.12p.

&gt; Does "make tests" work on the loop-AES source directory? If there are
&gt; problems with key setup or such, that test script should report problem.

It does.  I thought of that after I sent the email and tried it, and all 
tests passed successfully.

&gt; Looks like random junk == bad key setup.

To the best of my knowledge, it is the same key -- the timestamp hasn't 
changed.  I suppose it may have been corrupted though, I will compare it 
with my backup copy.

&gt; What does "losetup /dev/loop3" say? It should say "multi-key-v2" 

$ /sbin/losetup /dev/loop3
/dev/loop3: [000e]:748 (/dev/hdb4) encryption=AES128 multi-key-v2

&gt; What does "strings -a /sbin/losetup | grep multi-key" say?

$ strings -a /sbin/losetup | grep multi-key
multi-key-v3
multi-key-v2

After I verify the key hasn't been corrupted, I think I'll try a few 
more software combinations (e.g. clean version of mount as explained in 
documentation), unless you have any better suggestions.

If the encrypted partition header was corrupted, I would expect I'd 
still see something of value from /dev/loop3, but running strings on it 
gives me nothing recognizable.  I'm hoping it's just a software issue 
with multi-key, since single key encryption seems to be working fine. 
If worse comes to worse, I'll wipe the system drive and set my old FC3 
install back up.

Thanks,
Bill

No luck.  The key hasn't changed (vs. a backup on a different machine 
from a few months back), and a clean version of mount (util-linux-2.12q 
from ftp.kernel.org + patch provided in loop-AES-3.0d) doesn't work either.

I _was_ running loop-AES-3.0a prior to the FC4 install, upgraded to 
loop-AES-3.0d since 3.0a wouldn't compile under FC4, if that matters.

I'm going to create a separate FC3 partition, boot from that, and see if 
I can mount it with my old setup.

are encrypted. 

Just to get this whole things started lets say that I
established a shared secret between the communicating
entities. 
What is the best way to make this work. By this I mean
what is the best crypto API that I can use. I think
just for this purpose Openssl is overkill don't you
think. What kind of crypto API's can I incorporate
into my program to encrypt the message which is then
sent to the server. 

Thanks,
Vinay

No, this is the kind of thing that openssl is designed for. Someone's
already done the hard wofk for you, just use it. :-)

If you really want alternatives, you could investigate Peter Gutmann's
cryptlib. If you're distributing this, though, bear in mind that almost
every machine will already have openssl, while not many will have cryptlib
installed.

&gt; thank you, works great!
&gt; 
&gt; (i just changed cipher of a 150GB twofish-encrypted partition by dd'ing 
&gt; &gt;from one loop-device from another..now it's done and not a single bit 
&gt; lost ;-))

Interesting point! Loop-aes provides no option to change the key/password
for a partition. Using dd and two loop-devices is rather risky. What if the
machine just hangs up after 100GB? All data gone?
Well, I asked myself if there is a way to use some &gt;1GB partition (swap or
such) to store the data temporarily and pipe it further through the pipe. In
case of some crash a restore-point could be set and re-encryption restarted
or continued. But I have no idea what to enter in the command line in order
to define how the decrypted blocks can be counted.
For harddisk encryption this would be an interesting thing. Just in case
someone gets a copy of your keyfile you may want do change it.

Peter

Loop-AES never claimed to do anything for key/password management.

I think that this is the correct approach, as it permits flexibility  
in key management procedures. Key management is quite difficult, and  
a single policy will not help everyone.

The loop-AES README file has many examples that use GNU Privacy Guard  
(GPG) as a "front-end" to supply the password to the disk-encryption.  
The idea here is that the disk-encryption password is a long string  
of random bits, that is itself encrypted by GPG. You may use GPG to  
encrypt however you want: you may use public-key encryption, in which  
case you may have a number of users, each with their own secret  
password, all of them can decrypt the disk-encryption password and  
thus access the loop-AES partition.

Please look carefully at the loop-AES README for those examples.

dd is rather risky, but using a 1GB partition as a staging area  
sounds too difficult to do reliably; do it wrong, and its more risky  
than dd (because of implementation or user error). I do large  
transfers by simply mounting two different loop-AES disks, and using  
cpio or star or rsync to copy subsets of data from one volume to the  
other -- the userland tools are not aware of the underlying  
encryption, and I can verify the integrity of the data before  
deleting the older volume. I only do this sort of thing to migrate to  
larger hard disks as they become available, and I always keep at  
least two copies of my data, at least one copy is offline (cold disk  
or tape).

yeah, you can say that again: it's *damn* risky :-\
if the machine loses power or the "dd" dies (OOM?), half of the partition
is encrypted with twofish, the other part with aes...uuuh.

&gt; Well, I asked myself if there is a way to use some &gt;1GB partition (swap or

i *think* that if i know up to which sector dd has written, i can then
continue from exactly this point. but i've never tried it.

&gt; For harddisk encryption this would be an interesting thing. Just in case
&gt; someone gets a copy of your keyfile you may want do change it.

i've done this 3 or 4 times now, always successful, but always had a
backup at hand....

i was talking about changing the encryption cipher, not the passphrase. i
found aes128 faster than twofish128 on my machine, so i wanted to change
it. the passphrase of the gpg key was not changed here.

Thanks for replying. Yes you're right, that section seems to solve the 
problem. But I was wondering whether there is an easier and cleaner way; by 
just putting it into fstab and tell it not to invoke gpg?! Google revealed 
nothing.

There actually is a spamassassin installed on the mailing
list server, but its bayes filter wasn't being trained
properly.

I have now made some changes to the script I wrap around
ecartis, to automatically feed email from list members to
sa-learn --ham;  email from non-members is filtered by
spamassassin;  email to spamtraps is fed to sa-learn --spam.

This should keep the bayes filter properly trained and
should improve spam filtering on the list server.

I'm stuck experimenting with loop-aes v.2 for the time
being so I only can use that number of keys, so for
v.2 I assume that was correct :-)

After a kernel recompile I will upgrade.

Another solution occured to me this morning - instead
of piping the unencrypted keyfile, pipe the string of
commands to rxvt instead and execute with sh:

#N=65 #version 3
N=64 #version 2
((M = N + 1 ))
mkfifo -m 600 npipe
echo "head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - \
head -n $M | tail -n $N | gpg -c -a -o ${KEYFILE}"\
&gt;npipe &amp;
rxvt +sb -geometry 80x1 -fn fixed -cr blue \ 
-T "Password" -e sh npipe
wait
rm -f npipe

I'm not sure though if that is still less secure than
a separate script??

on a sidenote, using /dev/urandom is a bad idea. f.e. the standard
slackware install and other distros as well have the following code
in /etc/rc.d/rc.S:

# Carry an entropy pool between reboots to improve randomness.
if [ -f /etc/random-seed ]; then
  echo "Using /etc/random-seed to initialize /dev/urandom."

Consider this (stripped down) command line:

Without the -w10 option, aespipe's "Password:" prompt would get garbled
by mkisofs's preliminary output, which can be quite verbose at times.

I don't know if there are any other uses, but IMHO this usability one
warrants the -w option by itself.

Purpose is to wait before asking passphrase.

For example, if you were to decrypt something already encrypted, and then
re-encrypt it again with different key file or passphrase, you can use two
aespipe processes like this:

  ... | aespipe -d | aespipe | ...

In above case, both aespipe processes end up asking for passphrase
simultaneously. But how do you know which aespipe process gets first
passphrase? You don't. This works more consistently:

  ... | aespipe -d | aespipe -w 60 | ...
                             ^^^^^

aespipe README example 3 attempts to prevent aespipe password prompt from
getting lost in mkisofs output noise by using -w option like this:

  mkisofs -r directory-tree | aespipe -w 10 -K image.iso -O 16 &gt;&gt;image.iso
                                      ^^^^^
But that doesn't always work. It is better to just tell mkisofs to just shut
up. Like this:

  mkisofs -quiet -r directory-tree | aespipe -K image.iso -O 16 &gt;&gt;image.iso
          ^^^^^^

Not exactly.  Aespipe can encrypt/decrypt a whole filesystem in a single
operation, for example for burning an encrypted CD or DVD.

Loop-aes on the other hand lets you *mount* an encrypted filesystem and
access the files and directories within as normal files and directories.

They are both very useful tools.  I guess loop-aes could be used in the
place of aespipe if needed, but not the other way round.

Hang on - I think I might have got the wrong idea - 
when Yari says the following in the aesipe readme, is
is this meant to imply that loop-aes v.3 +
loop-aes-utils must be installed in order to mount the
encrypted filesystem as he describes? I think maybe
so.

3.4. Example 4 - Adding encryption to existing file
system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create 65 random encryption keys and encrypt those
keys using gpg. Reading
from /dev/random may take indefinitely long if
kernel's random entropy pool
is empty. If that happens, do some other work on some
other console (use
keyboard, mouse and disks). Use of gpg-encrypted key
file depends on
encrypted swap.

    umask 077
    head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n
66 | tail -n 65 \
        | gpg --symmetric -a &gt;/etc/fskey1.gpg

Add loop-AES (v3.0a or later) compatible encryption to
1.44 MB floppy disk:

    dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=64k | aespipe -K /etc/fskey1.gpg
| dd of=/dev/fd0 bs=64k conv=notrunc

Encrypted floppy can be mounted and unmounted under
Linux like this:

    mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy -o
loop=/dev/loop1,encryption=AES128,gpgkey=/etc/fskey1.gpg
    umount /floppy

Remove encryption from loop-AES encrypted 1.44 MB
floppy disk:

    dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=64k | aespipe -d -K
/etc/fskey1.gpg | dd of=/dev/fd0 bs=64k conv=notrunc

You need to recompile your kernel first as was pointed out in earlier mail
to this list. That is best way to ensure that kernel sources are in state
that can used to compile kernel modules.

&gt; Is it possible to download a precompiled up-to-date
&gt; loop-aes binary for various kernels, specifically
&gt; 2.4.26 (Debian i386)?

For some distro kernels, maybe. For kernels that you configure and compile
yourself, no.

Linux does not have binary kernel driver compatibility. Different kernel
versions have different kernel structures. Configuration options that are
set kernel config change code generation for locking code as well as size
and layout of kernel structures. Even C compiler version changes size and
layout of kernel structures. In other words: Every unique kernel version +
kernel configuration + C compiler version, needs its own kernel code and
modules compiled just for that unique combination. Such is Linux.

Thanks for the info.  I saw the earlier post but was
hoping to get away with just updating the loop.o
module since the README says:

"If you are just upgrading existing loop-AES with
newer
version, there is no need to recompile kernel or
reboot. Just unmount all file systems using old loop
driver, and remove loop driver from kernel with
rmmod command before compiling new loop driver."

I know that DamnSmallLinux is not a development
environment and not everything will compile properly
on it anyway (and I'm inexperienced). Worth a try
though.

At least one of the 2.6.x kernel knoppix-based livecds
(probably others too????) does contain a more recent
loop-aes (v.2.?) - http://grml.org - and, since it
uses unstable instead of stable, many of the packages
are more up-to-date than mainstream Knoppix. I might
give it a try, but DamnSmallLinux is a favourite with
me.

An afterthought.

The kernel configuration for the Knoppix sources is
(from FAQ):

Q: Where can I find the configuration for the kernel
used on KNOPPIX?
A: /usr/src/linux/.config or /boot/config-version

Can I point the compilation directly at this file
rather than the directory containing the MAKEFILE?

Thanks for pointing this out.  Indeed it appears it
would be wise to always pass the filesystem type to
mount either using -t or from /etc/fstab.

(Although, *touch wood*, mount seems to be very good
at guessing it's vfat if the (v)fat owner/group
options are set).

Thanks for your reply.

I now have the right sources + tree (Knoppix kernel
2.4.26 from the online DamnSmallLinux repository) -
these unpack to /usr/src. gcc is also installed.

And I've cp -Rp /KNOPPIX/* /ramdisk/home/dsl/source
and cp -Rp /KNOPPIX/.bash_profile
/ramdisk/home/dsl/source

(This last step just copies the running Knoppix kernel
to a directory 'source' so you can make alterations to
this before compressing this directory into a
"remastered" image file and building a new ISO (from
which I will burn a new cd).  So a new module should
be installed in 'source' I guess).

However I get this error:

root  ~/loop-aes/loop-AES-v3.0c $ -&gt; make clean
rm -f *.o *.ko *.orig *.rej *.mod.c patched-loop.[ch]
test-file[1234]

Is it possible to download a precompiled up-to-date

Then I wouldn't have to compile a new loop.o (refer my
other post)?

The Debian woody repository only has the same ancient
version as already present in my distro.

Point the kernel source directory to place where _you_ compiled the kernel.
If you have full kernel source and .config (with loop device disabled) at
/usr/src/linux/ directory, then to compile and install that kernel you can
do this:

 cd /usr/src/linux
 mv .config z
 make distclean
 mv z .config
 make oldconfig
 make dep &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make bzImage
 make modules &amp;&amp; make modules_install
 cat arch/i386/boot/bzImage &gt;/boot/vmlinuz
 cp System.map /boot/System.map

Then compile loop-AES module for that kernel:

 cd /usr/src/loop-AES-v3.0c
 make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux

Then configure your bootloader to boot kernel at /boot/vmlinuz

You failed to "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" beforehand.

BTW this is not a "problem with make for loop-aes", please read a good
tutorial on building your own kernel.

Here is a generic but up-to-date HOWTO:  http://tinyurl.com/3sybt
Here is a guide specific to Suse:  http://tinyurl.com/8zqr9  You can

Ah ..now I get it.  So it's only useful if aespipe is
in a pipe, as you descibe, and there's no "quiet"
option or equivalent for the prior command. (I suppose
you might achieve the same thing by redirecting a file
descriptor in some cases, too). 

While I hesistate to suggest anything at this stage of
my linux development, perhaps something about this
could be considered for future inclusion in Jari's README?

</body></email><email><emailId>20050609134255</emailId><senderName>Phil H</senderName><senderEmail>philtickle200@yahoo.com</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2005-06-09 13:42:55-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Question re use of dd to overwrite asset in README</subject><body>

Just me with another question ...

Is there any particular reason(s) the examples in the
loop-aes README use "dd" to overwrite the device with
encrypted zeros (in order to mask how much cyphertext
is subsequently written there), instead of (say) using
shred eg..

	&gt;~ ln -s /dev/fd0 tmp.$$
	&gt;~ shred -n 1 -v tmp.$$
rm -f tmp.$$

- as can be seen in some of the older online guides to
loop-aes.

Why do I care? Because dd doesn't appear to have
usable exit values (it's 1 no matter what happens?),
so you can't really test in a script if it's  finished
properly.

On the other hand, shred has a non-zero exit value if
something went wrong.

&gt; Why use a pipe at all?
&gt; 
&gt; cmd="head -c2925 /dev/urandom | uuencode -m - | sed
&gt; -n 2,$((N+1))p |
&gt;      gpg -c -a -o ${KEYFILE}"
&gt; rxvt +sb -geometry 80x1 -fn fixed -cr blue -T
&gt; Password -e sh -c "$cmd"

Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, however when I try
this the rxvt window opens and immediately closes
without waiting for a password.

If there's a named pipe rxvt cannot close until it
finishes reading from the pipe.

hi,

I am a kernel newbie trying to understand the Scatterlist CryptoAPI 
which comes with
the kernel (2.6.11.8) and i ran into some unknowns, can someone
enlighten me on this.

1.Why use scatterlist instead of a virtual address(buffer) and buffer
length?
2.What are the precautions that i should take when the buffer spans
multiple pages?
(should i find the no of pages to which the buffer extends and preapare 
a scatterlist struct for each page)

thanks
allen

Loop-AESers:

It is my understanding that Linux is capable of reading from an HFS+ MacOS
type filesystem. I am curious if someone were to have a FileVault generated
filesystem (HFS+ using FileVault, which is Apple's 128-bit AES encryption)
could loop-aes and Linux somehow mount this?

Ah, yes -- well, do not *ever* re-encrypt in-place (from/to the same  
data volume) with dd! I suppose it would work, as loop-AES is a block- 
level cipher, but I always move from one *disk* device to another  
when modifying the underlying encryption scheme.

&gt; Did you use a clean copy of util-linux, or the patched version provided

I used stock util-linux + patch from loop-AES

&gt; &gt; What does "losetup /dev/loop3" say? It should say "multi-key-v2"
&gt; 
&gt; $ /sbin/losetup /dev/loop3
&gt; /dev/loop3: [000e]:748 (/dev/hdb4) encryption=AES128 multi-key-v2

Did it say 'multi-key-v2' on the your earlier version of losetup?

It is possible that you used old single-key-only aware losetup with 64 keys.
In that case only first key was used, and the loop was really set up in
single-key mode.

Try this:

  cat keys | head -n 1 | /sbin/losetup -p 0 -e AES128 /dev/loop3 /dev/hdb4
             ^^^^^^^^^
  mount /dev/loop3 /mnt/storage

If that works, then this was caused by the "time-bomb" as explained in
loop-AES README section 7. If multi-key example is used with single-key-only
aware losetup, then things go south when losetup is upgraded to newer
multi-key aware one.

&gt; $ /sbin/losetup /dev/loop3
&gt; /dev/loop3: [000e]:748 (/dev/hdb4) encryption=AES128 multi-key-v2

Good.

&gt; $ strings -a /sbin/losetup | grep multi-key
&gt; multi-key-v3
&gt; multi-key-v2

Good.

Your losetup is from loop-AES-v3 and understands v1, v2 and v3 key files.

you could try running nasty, http://www.vanheusden.com/nasty/

with a patched gpg, there're only about 200 keys/sec tested on a
P-M @ 1,6GHz

There seems to be an issue with parameters about password length; one
can specify min/max length on the command line, but for me this
doesn't work. the author was informed about this.

Just a suggestion, but you might also want to consider
contacting the developer of CrossCryptGUI (Sarah Dean)
for some parallelism. I think she was interested in
adding support for (eg) gpg-encrypted keys in her GUI.
 But with CrossCrypt at a standstill I guess she
probably couldn't see the point...

I'm in need of a brain recompile !! - ignore all that
- all I did was inadvertently boot into the (wrong)
2.4.27 kernel which of course has my doctored loop.o
from before - I then thought I'd fixed it. But it
isn't fixed, as I saw on a subsequent reboot. So it
wasn't the symlink or LINUX_SOURCE switch.

uname -r should have told me what was going on.

Brain downtime is in order (sigh!).

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm sure this is something embarrassingly obvious
&gt; &gt; but ...?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Ah - I've worked out what was wrong!  I had deleted
&gt; the "linux" symlink in /usr/src before compiling
&gt; loop.o, and I didn't specify LINUX_SOURCE explicitly
&gt; as a "make" command switch.
&gt; 
&gt; My thanks for everybody's patience.  Not sure
&gt; whether
&gt; the fault was one or both of these, but after
&gt; re-doing
&gt; with the symlink back in and LINUX_SOURCE specified,
&gt; I
&gt; now have a working loop.o on this kernel, without
&gt; doing any dubious manipulations.
&gt; 
&gt; One more thing though (sorry!):
&gt; 
&gt; The debian source came from www.backports.org and
&gt; was 
&gt; kernel-source-2.4.26_2.4.26-6_all.deb.  In fact I
&gt; was
&gt; actually looking for the deb source for the
&gt; downloaded
&gt; kernel image from the same place, which was
&gt;
kernel_image-2.4.26-1-386_2.4.26-5.backports.org.1_i386.deb
&gt; That kernel source was all that was there for
&gt; 2.4.26. 
&gt; I posted to the backports mail list to check that I
&gt; did in fact have the right source, and was told that
&gt; this source did in fact pertain to my downloaded
&gt; kernel image, despite the fact that one has a "-5"
&gt; and
&gt; the other a "-6" in the handles.  I didn't follow
&gt; the
&gt; explanation as to why there were different numbers:
&gt; one had been rebuilt and the other hadn't been, or
&gt; something.
&gt; 
&gt; "fakesource" then created source code from this with
&gt; the directory name
&gt; /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.26-1-386.
&gt; 
&gt; But the kernel that actually runs from
&gt;
kernel_image-2.4.26-1-386_2.4.26-5.backports.org.1_i386.deb
&gt; is (according to uname -r) 2.4.27-2-386 (note the
&gt; "2").
&gt; 
&gt; This led to a warning at the end of building
&gt; loop-aes-ciphers that the modules were built for
&gt; 2.4.26-1-386 but the running kernel was 2.4.26-2-386
&gt; and that these wouldn't run (although they do).
&gt; 
&gt; How significant are these appended kernel build
&gt; numbers on the same version kernel, especially when
&gt; one or both numbers have been generated by
&gt; fakesource/backports?
&gt; 
&gt; Should I still be concerned? - all tests have been
&gt; passed so far.

Linux-crypto:  cryptography in and on the Linux system

Thanks for your reply.

I'm very pleased with method 4 of the README.debian in
your packages - I was just obsessing about what I was
doing wrong with module-assistant. Probably something
idiotic on my part to do with the sources?

&gt; .. Please expand the "somethingorother" part.

OK. I get:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target
`/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27-2-386/include/linux/autoconf.h',
needed by
`/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27-2-386/include/linux/modules/signal.ver'.
Stop.
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27-2-386/kernel'
make[1]: *** [_sfdep_kernel] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27-2-386'
make: *** [dep-files] Error 2

A subsequent attempt to build the module with these
faked sources fails.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW: please send Debian specific questions to the
&gt; relevant places 
&gt; (debian-user list, BTS, me, etc.); I guess this is
&gt; all not very
&gt; interesting nor relevant for most people on
&gt; linux-crypto.
&gt; 
Will do - my apologies for the newbie posts and thanks
for the assistance.  I'll try to keep my posts here on
less distro-specific matters.

&gt; The loop-aes README is quite unambiguous about the
&gt; need to ensure that the kernel against which the
&gt; loop.o driver is built has been compiled "...so that
&gt; CONFIG_MODULES=y
&gt; and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n".  (The usual with
&gt; downloaded precompiled debian kernels would be
&gt; CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=m). (As I have been attempting to
&gt; do)

Debian's loop-aes module package moves the original loop module out of
the way and will restore it, when it's deinstalled.  As long as you do
not want to have your root on an loop-aes-encrypted volume, you can
use a stock debian kernel.  I'm using loop-aes-encrypted swap on a few
machines with Debian's kernels 2.6.8-2 and 2.6.11-1.

Root on an loop-aes volume will not be easy with a stock debian
kernel, because it is built much too modular.  Although it's
definately possibly if you build a custom initrd, I wouldn't recommend
it.

Jim

loop-AES version 1 on-disk format as implemented by the kernel driver, is
compatible with cryptoloop AES up to 2 TB device size. However, the userpace
key setup part of mount and losetup programs most likely are not compatible
by default (didn't look at gentoo patch).

loop-AES version 2 and 3 on-disk formats are not compatible with mainline.

Securitywise, loop-AES-v1 / cryptoloop on-disk format is busted. Don't ever
consider using those.

&gt; - is there any performance diffrences between loopaes and cryptoapi or are
&gt; the optimized pentium code even the same?

Last time I checked, loop-AES was faster, but I haven't speed tested
mainline crypto code for long time.

Hey

I use debian unstable, but I don't think that was the issue.
Everything's fine now. Most likely just some weird keymap error.

ok, but since i've made the prealloc parameter a "tuneable" for my script,
i'll probably use it for the next benchmarks.


thanks,

(PS: my benchmarks really convinced me to use AES, and not other ciphers,
at least on x86. it's way faster....)

My guess from 'patched-loop.c' is that you are using loop-AES. It would help
if you said what version you are using. 2.6.12-rc5-mm1 kernel needs these:

Thanks for your response.

&gt; well, the computer "locks up" ;-)
&gt; it stops working..

Ah-ha - a system freeze! I thought it must've been
something else.

&gt; ..some data might be lost.

Could keep a backup of the file "volume" and hope for
the best I suppose.

&gt; &gt; and nothing has ever 'locked up'.

My file "volumes" have been on a FAT drives,
loop-devices formatted with vfat or ext2, and are
small say &lt;150MB (not 2+ GB), and I have 1GB RAM&lt; I
don't know if that explains or not why there haven't
been system freezes yet.

if you can, don't let mount(8) *guess* what filesystem to mount. as the 
manpage states:

   "If your data  is  valuable,  don't  ask  mount  to guess."

this is why the -t option is for.

but this has nothing to do with crypto and is basically just unix 101...

Hi!

I'm delurking cause of emigrating to kernel 2.6.11 with util-linux2.12i
patched for cryptoapi. I used loop-aes Version 2x with Suse old 2.4 Kernel
and was very happy about the features. (Well one year ago I patched it twice
with a newer version, bad luck shovling data graves) - I'm thinking of
repatching the util-linux back to normal to use loopaes, but before I've
following questions:
- is aes-256 encryption of cryptoapi compatible with loop-aes 256 or do I
have to backup my data first (I know I should do that anyway :)
- is there any performance diffrences between loopaes and cryptoapi or are
the optimized pentium code even the same?
- will there be an jari aes chiper for encrypting swap with crypto api?

TIA &amp; and damn good work jari!

My apologies if this is an overly naive question.
I've found little help on this via google or in the
loop-aes README or similar places and I've looked
hard.

I have been writing some scripts for myself to
simplify creating &amp; mounting loop-aes (aes256) loop
devices.

Please tell me if the following observations are
correct:

1. Loop devices must be mounted as root (using the
builtin loop-handling features of mount).

2. There's no need to write anything to /etc/fstab. If
the loop device is formatted with ext2, you can chown
&amp; chmod the mount point directory after mounting to
provide a non-root user(s) with access to that
directory.

3. BUT trying to chown &amp; chmod a mount point directory
for a loop device that was formatted with vfat results
in a "operation not allowed" error and it can't be
done. Writing anything to /etc/fstab makes no
difference. So ENCRYPTED LOOP DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN
FORMATTED WITH VFAT, MSDOS ETC CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED AS
ROOT.

Is this correct or not?

The only thing I could find was from a web-board
posting concerning something similar with dm-crypt.
One poster said that THE FAT PERMISSIONS OPTIONS FOR
`MOUNT` (see MAN MOUNT) DO NOT WORK AT ALL FOR
LOOPBACK DEVICES, so these can't be used to solve
this.

Since vfat etc have no memory for permissions, they
inherit root permissions from mount running as root,
and if you attempt to change these permissions these
cannot be 'remembered'. Someone said that IT WAS
POSSIBLE TO CHANGE PERMISSIONS SO THAT EXISTING FILES
IN THE MOUNT PONT DIRECTORY COULD BE ACCESSED BY A
NON-ROOT USER, BUT ANY NEW FILES WOULD ONLY BE
ACCESSIBLE AS ROOT. I haven't been able to achieve
this.

HOW DO YOU DO THIS?

I'd really appreciate a crystal-clear walk-through of
the above issues and I'm sure other newbies might too.

Many thanks in advance.

Hi



&gt; 1. Loop devices must be mounted as root (using the
&gt; builtin loop-handling features of mount).

No.

You can "predefine" an entry in /etc/fstab that can be mounted by user.


(This is one long line!)
&lt;path_to_image_file&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt;   vfat 
rw,noatime,encryption=&lt;encryption&gt;,gpgkey=&lt;gpg_key&gt;,noauto,user 0 0

The jumping points are user &amp; noauto, "noauto" prevents an automatic 
mount while booting and "user" allows an ordinary user to issue the 
mount with
mount &lt;mountpoint&gt;.
The user (and root) is then allowed to umount that mount.

 &gt; 2. There's no need to write anything to /etc/fstab. If
 &gt; the loop device is formatted with ext2, you can chown
 &gt; &amp; chmod the mount point directory after mounting to
 &gt; provide a non-root user(s) with access to that
 &gt; directory.

ext2 can store privileges, VFAT cannot. But you can set the privileges 
used. See below.

 &gt; 3. BUT trying to chown &amp; chmod a mount point directory
 &gt; for a loop device that was formatted with vfat results
 &gt; in a "operation not allowed" error and it can't be
 &gt; done. Writing anything to /etc/fstab makes no
 &gt; difference. So ENCRYPTED LOOP DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN
 &gt; FORMATTED WITH VFAT, MSDOS ETC CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED AS
 &gt; ROOT.

No
The options
uid=&lt;your used-id&gt;
gid=&lt;your group-id&gt;
fmask=&lt;filemask&gt; e.g. 133 (=644)
dmask=&lt;directorymask&gt; e.g. 022 (=755)
set the privileges used for any file/directory on a vfat (and some more 
filesystems).

 &gt; The only thing I could find was from a web-board
 &gt; posting concerning something similar with dm-crypt.
 &gt; One poster said that THE FAT PERMISSIONS OPTIONS FOR
 &gt; `MOUNT` (see MAN MOUNT) DO NOT WORK AT ALL FOR
 &gt; LOOPBACK DEVICES, so these can't be used to solve
 &gt; this.

Pure bullshit. Loop doesn't know (or has to know) anything about whats 
"inside".

The loop driver does nothing else but create a "block device" with the 
file as backing-store and translates the requests issued to the block 
device (/dev/loop&lt;x&gt;) to the file used to represent the block device.
There is noting more a loop-driver does.

The Filesystem doesn't know either what is done to the requests it sends 
to a block device. For the filesystem any block device looks the same, 
regardless if it is a HDD, FDD, a(n encrypted-)loop or whatever else is 
used to satisfy the issued requests.

Abstraction is a great invention. :-)

Actually block devices have differences that file systems have to deal with:
1)  Hard sector sizes may be different. File system code must detect block
    device hard sector size and avoid issuing partial sector accesses.
2)  Some device drivers don't support variable length read/write requests.
    XFS for example had (has?) list of 'problematic' devices that needed
    fixed size read/write requests. IIRC, md raid on 2.4 kernels was such
    block device that got upset when banged with variable length requests.
3)  Some block devices support write barriers on 2.6 kernels, some don't.
    A file system that wants to issue barrier write requests have to work
    around the not supported cases.
4)  Maximum request sizes and bunch of other limits may be different.

OK. That was new to me.

I change my paragrah to:
For the filesystem most block devices look pretty much the same. There 
are a few special cases, but they are only relevant for filesystem 
developers.

:-)

Thanks Matthias for your help (and Jari for the
clarification). However I'm still having problems.

I make a device-backed aes256-encrypted loop, where
the device is a floppy, format the loop device with
vfat, then deallocate the loop.  Then I put the
following in /etc/fstab:

/dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1 vfat
defaults,rw,noatime,encryption=aes256,noauto,user 0 0

(I've also tried using 'users' plus the guid etc
settings as for the fstab entries for my hard drives).

BUT when I try to mount as an ordinary user I get:

"mount: only root can do that"

sudo mount works, but the mount directory has
root-only access permissions.

This is why I has the wrong notions in my initial post
- I'd tried this before.

What is going wrong?

PS: I'm using a knoppix-based distro

I'd always set uid/gid, to be sure.

(Personally i always use an automounter(autofs), here you have to provide the UID/GID \
as the mount-command is always issued from the automount-daemon in root-context. \
Unfortunatly you can't use an automounter if you have to provide a password(*))

&gt; BUT when I try to mount as an ordinary user I get:
&gt; 
&gt; "mount: only root can do that"

I'd guess your mount-command misses the SUID-Bit.

ls -la /bin/mount
-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root           84888 Mar 23 12:58 /bin/mount

The fourth Character from the beginning must be an "s", without SUID-Bit there would \
be an "x". Also mount must belong to root.

chown root.root /bin/mount
chmod 4755 /bin/mount

&gt; sudo mount works, but the mount directory has
&gt; root-only access permissions.

At this point you hadn't provided uid( &amp; gid).
With sudo mount is called under the root account, so the "inherited" uid &amp; gid are \
the ones from root.

&gt; This is why I has the wrong notions in my initial post
&gt; - I'd tried this before.
&gt; 
&gt; What is going wrong?

I'd say:
A mixture of subtle differences in your distro paired with a little bit of missing \
experience. :-)

&gt; PS: I'm using a knoppix-based distro

May only be relevant for the "doesn't ship with SUID-bit-set-for-mount"-part. AFAIR \
there are Distros with a bit more restrictive security regarding SUID programs. Maybe \
this is one if them.

There are ways to cicumvent this, but that is no point here. :-)

Thanks again Matthias! I've had success at last (!)
by putting the options in the mount line (not fstab)
as follows):

sudo mount -o
loop,noatime,noauto,user,exec,fmask=133,dmask=022,uid=1001,gid=50,encryption=aes256
/dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1

I never thought I'd see the day!

BUT 

1. I still can't get mount to work here as a non-root
user.

&gt; I'd guess your mount-command misses the SUID-Bit.
&gt; 
&gt; ls -la /bin/mount
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root           84888 Mar 23
&gt; 12:58 /bin/mount

Unfortunately, no.  ls -la /bin/mount shows exactly
these same permissions including the SUID-bit.
So at present I still can't mount a loop device
without being root.

2. And fstab options do not appear to be read by
mount:

I've changed the fstab line to:
/dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1 vfat
noatime,loop,encryption=aes256,noauto,user,exec,fmask=133,dmask=022,uid=1001,gid=50
0
In theory mount should read in all the options from
this line from /etc/fstab, yes?
But sudo mount /dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1 yields (you
can hear the floppy drive working):
"mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
So I do:
sudo mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1 yields
the error message:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on
/dev/fd0,
       or too many mounted file systems

While not writing the options to fstab is hardly an
issue for a livecd boot - I'd need to restore this
line before each mount anyway (so why bother?) - I'm
now curious as to WHY it doesn't work.

Any more ideas?

I've installed gnu-utils in case damnsmalllinux's
Busybox mount (base system) was the problem, but it
makes no difference whatsoever.  Gnu-utils apparently
has mount version mount-2.11x.

&gt; A mixture of subtle differences in your distro
&gt; paired with a little bit of missing experience. :-)
&gt; 
Without doubt a good deal of the latter!..:=)

As long as you NOT specify a full commandline!
You must let out the mount-point or the Device, otherwise (i guess)

With a full command-line in fstab a
mount /dev/fd0
or
mount /home/dsl/crypt1
is enough.

Ah-ha!!  So it's that simple!  I see that was the main point of Jari's post, also.
I'll try this on Monday - if you don't here from me then the problem is solved.
 
Now I guess that must be written quite clearly in `man mount` somewhere, but I must \
have somehow missed it. I'll look again.  
How I wish I'd posted here earlier instead of pulling my hair out and constructing \
wild theories! I suppose this was partly because the online examples I was looking at \
all seemed to only ever format in ext2.  
I've been using linux for only about eight months.
 
Thanks again for your help and to Jari also. I have other newbie-ish questions also \
but I'll post these in their own threads.

As long as you NOT specify a full commandline!
You must let out the mount-point or the Device, otherwise (i guess) 
mount won't look into fstab.

With a full command-line in fstab a
mount /dev/fd0
or
mount /home/dsl/crypt1
is enough.

I confirm that I can now mount a vfat-formatted loop
device as a non-root user with the appropriate line in
/etc/fstab and just doing mount ~/crypt1 in a shell -
thanks!

HOWEVER it seems that if I do not put the line in
/etc/fstab and instead try to mount -o with all the
same options from the commandline, then I can only do
that as root.

Is that correct?

The man-page says nothing about that.
And i haven't tried it, but i guess because of security a non-root user can't add \
additional options. Otherwise you could make a mount read-write that was only intend \
read-only, make programs executable or whatever else you can change with the options.

yes.

think about it: *any* user would be using "-o" then and doing perhaps
nasty things. /etc/fstab is (hopefully) only writeable by root and *he*
determines the -o(ptions) to mount a certain filesystem.

my "man 8 mount" says:

(iii) Normally, only the superuser can mount file systems.  However, when
      fstab contains the user option on a line, anybody can mount the
      corresponding system.

...and when you "do not put the line in /etc/fstab", there is no "user"
option in fstab any more - hence only the superuser can mount it.

Another "ah-ha" moment - thanks for the taking the
time.  All makes perfect sense now.

My scripts need sudo rights for other reasons (eg to
grep losetup -a) so there's no problem with using sudo
mount anyway.

I also notice a benefit of sudo mount: the filesystem
does not seem to have to be specified in the
commandline.

mount as sudo must somehow work this out for itself.

&gt;mount as sudo must somehow work this out for itself.

It's dawned (!) on me that this is because I'm using
fat options in the mount line, so mount automatically
assumes it's a (v)fat filesystem.

The downside is I can then no longer mount eg
ext2-formatted volumes using the same script line.

So, either in the mount line or in /etc/fstab, I must
tell mount what filesystem type is to be mounted.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; sudo mount -o

&gt; &gt; /dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I never thought I'd see the day!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; BUT 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. I still can't get mount to work here as a
&gt; non-root
&gt; &gt; user.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;I'd guess your mount-command misses the SUID-Bit.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;ls -la /bin/mount
&gt; &gt;&gt;-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root           84888 Mar
&gt; 23
&gt; &gt;&gt;12:58 /bin/mount
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, no.  ls -la /bin/mount shows
&gt; exactly
&gt; &gt; these same permissions including the SUID-bit.
&gt; &gt; So at present I still can't mount a loop device
&gt; &gt; without being root.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. And fstab options do not appear to be read by
&gt; &gt; mount:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've changed the fstab line to:
&gt; &gt; /dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1 vfat
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
noatime,loop,encryption=aes256,noauto,user,exec,fmask=133,dmask=022,uid=1001,gid=50
&gt; &gt; 0
&gt; &gt; In theory mount should read in all the options
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; this line from /etc/fstab, yes?
&gt; 
&gt; As long as you NOT specify a full commandline!
&gt; You must let out the mount-point or the Device,
&gt; otherwise (i guess) 
&gt; mount won't look into fstab.
&gt; 
&gt; With a full command-line in fstab a
&gt; mount /dev/fd0
&gt; or
&gt; mount /home/dsl/crypt1
&gt; is enough.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But sudo mount /dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1 yields
&gt; (you
&gt; &gt; can hear the floppy drive working):
&gt; &gt; "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
&gt; &gt; So I do:
&gt; &gt; sudo mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /home/dsl/crypt1
&gt; yields
&gt; &gt; the error message:
&gt; &gt; mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; /dev/fd0,
&gt; &gt;        or too many mounted file systems
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; While not writing the options to fstab is hardly
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; issue for a livecd boot - I'd need to restore this
&gt; &gt; line before each mount anyway (so why bother?) -
&gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; now curious as to WHY it doesn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any more ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Many, but nothing which is relevant for this. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've installed gnu-utils in case damnsmalllinux's
&gt; &gt; Busybox mount (base system) was the problem, but
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; makes no difference whatsoever.  Gnu-utils
&gt; apparently
&gt; &gt; has mount version mount-2.11x.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;A mixture of subtle differences in your distro
&gt; &gt;&gt;paired with a little bit of missing experience.
&gt; :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Without doubt a good deal of the latter!..:=)
&gt; 
&gt; I've been using Linux for 10 years this fall.
&gt; So i guess i have a little advantage in using Linux
&gt; all these years. :-)

Thanks - now I have.  This works if the loop was
formatted with minix - mounts ok (I'm not sure why
anuone would want ot format with minix, but there you
go). mtab reports the permissions that are specified
in the mount line for fat, although these have been
ignored - the mount point directory has inherited root
permissions from sudo mount.

But mounting an ext2-formatted loop device fails.

I put the s option in from of the others as follows:

sudo mount -s -o [other options....]

Is that correct? It didn't seem to work if I put it in
with the fat options.

It was just a shot into the blue. Seams it doesn't work.


When you use 2 diffrent mount-points you can use 2 diffrent lines in fstab.
Then a
mount &lt;first&gt; || mount &lt;second&gt;
mounts whatever succeeds.
(Or just do mount &lt;first&gt; ; mount &lt;second&gt; and after that look which succeeded)


If you want to hide the diffrent mount-points from whetever wants to access the \
filesystem you can use "new" mount-points and create symlink to the "old" place \
(don't forget to remove the dir before), after the mount to the successfull mount. \
(Or --bind mount the mount-point of the successfull-mount over the "old" mountpoint. \
In this case the directory must stay)

Hi!

Ive gotten to the point where Ive shreded my entire drive and Im currently running from 
knoppix trying to set up the loopback devices. 

I stumbled upon an error with multi-key v3 when running the following

#./losetup -e AES256 -K rootkey.gpg -o @32256 -s 1003451904 /dev/loop0 /dev/hda

run from the usb-stick

after entering the passphrase I get this.
ioctl: LOOP_MULTI_KEY_SETUP_V3: Invalid argument

Im unsure what part of the setup is responsible for this but I guess its losetups 
fault

Darned. 

I chose knoppix because it had support for loop-aes and now I find out its 
not the right support.
Crap!
Do you know of any good boot discs that are available for download that 
would do all I need to encrypt my hda?

&gt; (watermarks etc), or is it a threat to the integrity
&gt; of the original data itself (ie you might lose
&gt; the data altogether), or is it both?

i'm not aware of security issues with file-backed loop devices, but if the
machine locks up, your partition did not get cleanly unmounted as on a
regular shutdown - hence some data might be lost. journaling filesystems
would provide fs-integrity, but not data integrity.

&gt; c) Is this a version-dependant issue? 
&gt; I have experimented with file-backed loops on v1.6i-1
&gt; (old and not recommended, I know, but that's what's inside my distro)
&gt; and nothing has ever 'locked up'.

lucky you ;-)
maybe this thread will clear things up a bit, more to find on the web:

whoops. "tonight" took a bit longer, thank to the incredible long runs of

notice that with lo_prealloc=500 only results for ext3 and jfs are
available (because i interrupted the test)

Thanks Christian.

Looks like performance does not differ much for above prealloc values. Only
tiobench sequential reads using many threads showed some improvement with
lo_prealloc=250, but maximum latencies went up too.

No change for default lo_prealloc=125 based on above data.

Hi!

I've succesfully encrypted and booted my hard drive from a usb-device.
Now I have a problem with missing stuff in the kernel for other stuff.

I recompile a new kernel from another release (to ensure I don't break
anything) But when I get to the point where I should enter my password
it won't accept it. Or rather I get a simple error. I've thought i might
be that the keymap has been the problem since I have a few odd characters.

But when I tried to use the loadnationalkb=1 the old kernel still works
but not the new one. I'm not sure how to check this error. To see what's
wrong.

Thanks in advance.
Gabriel

Well it's ok now. I recompiled the kernel without trying to build the

AOK now. Thanks.

Hi!

I´d like to know what distro and versions you used. Under all versions of
SuSE from 8.2 to recent 9.3 I made it to encrypt root partition. SuSE 9.3
had some "extras" to be solved but it works ok now.
So what distro do you use? If there are problems I´d like to read about
them.

Regards,
Peter

OK, I've set up this list, trustedpost@nl.linux.org.  Note that

You can subscribe like this:

&gt; 
&gt; The amount of spam that actually does get through doesn't seem to be

&gt; is that this should only require a couple other people.

Indeed.  Lets see how the "trustedpost" thing works out, and
then we can look at the other measures.

If you read via gmane or another source, and want to post to
the list without subscribing - just add yourself to trustedpost
and you'll be able to send mail to the list just fine.

Hi!

Maybe you can still try to use your Knoppix CD with loop-aes in version 2 or
1 on-disk format.
If you don´t want that you might try spb-linux and build your own knoppix
with all the software and features you want.

If someone gets root access, there's nothing you can do.  Even if there

Hi ,
  I'm experimenting with loop-AES, and I really like it , the doc was
wonderfull too :) thx to all ...

  But i'm wondering something since once the partition has been mounted
it's available for reading to the valid user in clear what would happen
if someone were to access a computer that is already logged in with a
valid user, or someone that would root the machine remotly and gain
access to the mounted partition ?=20

 I guess encryption won't be usefull againts these 2 attacks but maybe
something could be done to minimise the risk.... ?

 I'm thinking like to unmount the partition on usb stick removal or
xwindow lock ? Sure I could do I by hand, i'm just wondering ...  :)

Thanks

Antoine

Thanks for your patience and help. I've now been able to boot my
encrypted drive. The problem was that I had the wrong name on my default
choice in syslinux. Terribly stupid indeed.

Dear list,

	is there any hardware acceleration card (something computing AES
at hardware-speed) for the i386 platform, to be used with loop-AES?

Do you know of any such card that could *possibly* be used, after a bit
of driver work?  I'm looking for something on the cheap side, to plug
into my modest system, otherwise I would rather upgrade the whole
computer.  Ie. there's no point in a card that costs like an Opteron +
mainboard + RAM, if you see my point.

Another question: I see that loop-AES comes with an assembly core
optimized for Pentium-2 processors.  Do you think there would be any
sensible speed gain in rewriting/modifying that core to take advantage
of MMX, 3DNow and other such features offered by newer CPUs?


Regards
Toby

PS: First things last :-) a big thank you to Jari and to everyone
involved in loop-AES and preceding projects.  It is a truly useful
piece of software!

I purchased a Soekris Engineering PCI card that incorporates a hifn  
7451 encryption accelerator chip for use with my system, which  
usually runs FreeBSD. For that OS (and OpenBSD), the chipset is  
supported and is used for TCP network encryption: off-loading VPN  
computations from the network protocol stack from the main CPU.

However, after getting into the sources etc. I found that chip is  
*NOT* used for the disk encryption, which was my primary interest.  
The reason is the relatively low latency of disk I/O vs. network I/O  
-- for the network encryption, it's perhaps slight gain to perform  
the encryption in off-board hardware, particularly for low-power,  
embedded CPUs from 2000-2003, with clock speeds less than 1 GHz.

But for disk I/O you're better off with a commodity 1+ GHz processor  
rather than an off-board dedicated crypto engine.

You can of course find rather expensive disk controllers that may  
claim to do the disk encryption in hardware, and there are even some  
relatively inexpensive external disk enclosures (FireWire, USB) which  
do this. You have to trust the vendor to get the encryption right,  
and in some cases they have got it horribly wrong. The excellent  
revisions that Jari has made to loop-AES over the past 18 months  
demonstrate how difficult it is to get encryption right, and how the  
understanding of encryption implementation will evolve over time.

So I think you're better off getting a new CPU/motherboard.

The VIA EPIA mini-ITX systems are particularly interesting for this  
application, because VIA has implemented some crypto primitives on  
the CPU *core* -- like MMX, extensions to the instruction set. This  
is wonderful, as there is no more overhead in calling a crypto engine  
as there would be to perform a floating-point instruction: it's all  
on the core of the processor, relatively fast. This month's Linux  
Journal has a write-up of the technology that is very interesting.
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8042
http://www.google.com/search?q=VIA+padlock

Soekris Engineering http://www.soekris.com Hifn PCI card is about  
$150 USD.
No standard Linux implementation of a device driver for this chip,  
Google around for 2.4-kernel implementations.

Just to follow up for future googlers.

This process worked for me.  However, I was fortunate -- I didn't need 
the conv=noerror,sync and the block size issue didn't seem to effect me 
($ dd bs=512 if=/dev/hdb11 of=hdb11.dmg -- seemed to work just fine)

Once I had *several copies* of the data I started playing around and 
after being unable to find the superblock, I ran

$ losetup -e AES128 /dev/loop0 hdb11.dmg
$ e2fsck -f -y /dev/loop0

just for the heck of it (with the assumption that it would *destroy the data* in that \
*copy*).   It spat a boatload of horrible error messages at me.  Then I mounted it, \
looked in the lost+found directory, and 99% of my files were there.

Thanks for the help Jari.  And sorry to bug the crypto list on what turned out to be \
a ext2fs issue.


Thanks,
Mike

Hi,

Have a hard drive failure/recovery problem.

I've been happily using loop-AES (AES-128)  with Mandrake 9.2 (now
10.1) since mid-2003.  Tonight my 3yr old hard drive either got too
hot or seems to be slowly dying.

Its crashed out several times and I've been dd'ing all my data off my
old drive onto a new drive with

$ dd  bs=512 if=/dev/hdb11 of=hdb11.dmg

However, after these crashes, both the drive itself and the image
refuse to mount the encrypted partition with

$ mount -o ext2 /dev/hdb11 /mnt/hdb11 -o encrypted,encryption=AES128,loop

It asks for my passphrase as usual however after I enter it gives:

mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loopX,
           or too many mounted file systems
           (could this be the IDE device.....

Has anyone seen this before and is there any method I can use to get
into to my data?  I'm reasonably sure the data is still there (most of
the data on unencrypted partitions is dd'ing over to the new hd just
fine), all my options are the same as usual, it just seems that the
partition header (or where ever the hash is stored) may have been
corrupted.

This is essentially my home directory so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike Manning

Bah..  Apologies.  I'm not sure whether my drive uses loop-AES or
crytpoloop, its whatever Mandrake was using in its installer circa
9.1/9.2.  That said, based on the below, is there anything I can do or
is there a better place to ask this question?

Thanks,

Hi!

SuSE 9.3 (64-bit) make me trouble using an usb-stick to mount encrypted root
partition. So far I made it to build-in all features needed to boot from
usb-stick. The point is, mounting /dev/sdb1 as /lib fails somehow. I don´t
know exactly why:-(
Here is what mkinitrd says:
mkinitrd
Root device:    /dev/sda2 (mounted on / as ext3)
Module list:    sata_via via82cxxx jbd ext3

Kernel image:   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11.4-20a-default
Initrd image:   /boot/initrd-2.6.11.4-20a-default
Shared libs:    lib/ld-2.3.4.so lib/libc.so.6 lib64/ld-2.3.4.so
lib64/libblkid.so.1.0 lib64/libc.so.6 lib64/libcom_err.so.2.1

Driver modules: kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko
kernel/drivers/scsi/sd_mod.ko kernel/drivers/scsi/libata.ko

kernel/drivers/cdrom/cdrom.ko kernel/drivers/ide/ide-cd.ko
Filesystem modules:     kernel/fs/jbd/jbd.ko kernel/fs/ext3/ext3.ko
Including:      klibc initramfs udev fsck.ext3
Bootsplash:     SuSE (1024x768)
9919 blocks

I wonder about these "shared libs". They can´t be built into the kernel but
seem to be needed for mounting partitions.
Has somebody an idea what to do about the shared libs
lib/ld-2.3.4.so
lib/libc.so.6
lib64/ld-2.3.4.so
lib64/libblkid.so.1.0
lib64/libc.so.6
lib64/libcom_err.so.2.1
lib64/libext2fs.so.2.4
lib64/libselinux.so.1
lib64/libuuid.so.1.2
This problem didn´t show up before. The initrd-2.6.11.4-20a-default file
that suse creates is 2MB large, larger than the kernel itself.

Peter

Can you post exact error message that you see?

Assuming that you created the failing encrypted-root-initrd by running
build-initrd.sh from loop-AES package, the code that mounts /lib is linked
statically, and should not fail because of user space library dependencies.

&gt; Driver modules: kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko

&gt; Including:      klibc initramfs udev fsck.ext3

Please post your compressed kernel config and build-initrd.sh config. This
is most likely caused by something missing from built-in kernel code that is
needed to mount /lib and root partitions.

The message doesn´t get logged. It says that /lib/losetup and the other
programs "return an error code". It seems that the stick can´t be mounted at
all.

Yes, that is my favourite, too. I guess it is because of some library.
Runnig mkinitrd shows that Suse packs several libs into the initrd. From my
kernel.config you can see that I successfully changed the Suse standard
config to build in all driver and code, from IDE support to vfat and ext3.
It has to be something with the libraries.

Hi

Got a question.

I just installed loop-aes here to try it, since I only have an older loop
version installed And I fear that I cannot reproduce it when the system ever
crashes. I am trying to figure out, how to get loop-aes to read the old
partitions (which are on DVD - some as container some just as raw data). I
have already installed the ciphers since I need twofish-256 for it.
The original loop only asks for password, not keysize (which is given as -e
twofish-256) and it uses no gpg-keyfile or therelike.

If all goes wrong, I can always get the data down from all DVDs with my old
system and copy it to a new system (either loop-aes or windows "DriveCrypt"
which is my encryption for my workplace), but I'd like to avoid this.

It seems, that cryptography on linux is somewhat complicated with all the
different patched versions of "losetup" and "mount" around - not to mention
the various kernel-patches...
So if loop-aes is not compatible to my old files, I might try 4GB
drivecrypt-containerfiles to burn on DVD for now until I can be sure that my
crypto-files will still be accessible in some years...

Is there no encryption avaiable that will be readable and writeable with
windows and linux?

Ciao
A.W.

Build-initrd.sh config looked ok. Didn't look at kernel config because /lib
mount appears to be ok.

&gt; Command "/lib/loadkeys /lib/default.kmap" returned error
&gt; Command "/lib/insmod /lib/modules-2.6.11.4-20a-default/loop.ko" returned
&gt; error

Error message "Mounting /dev/sdb1 as /lib failed" means that /lib mount
failed. Above error messages mean that /lib was already mounted
successfully, but there is some userspace library dependence that causes the
failure.

Plan A
~~~~~~
Make sure that all programs copied to your USB-stick have their libraries
copied there also. As in 'ldd /sbin/losetup ; ldd /sbin/insmod' and so on.
At least Red Hat and Gentoo seem to ship ldd program that no longer outputs
proper path to the library file in all cases, and that causes
build-initrd.sh script to skip those libraries. I would not be surprised if
SUSE had adopted that same braindamage as well.

Plan B
~~~~~~
Can you try setting INITRDONLY=1 in build-initrd.sh config and manually copy
statically linked copies off all needed programs (losetup, insmod, loadkeys
and gpg) to your USB-stick.

Have you installed the loop-aes ciphers?
Have you installed the loop_twofish module via modprobe?

&gt;&gt; Second is key management, which is very flexible, but you have to
&gt;&gt; implement your own method. The loop-aes README is a great resource
&gt;&gt; for new implementations, using GPG. But that does not help you if you
&gt;&gt; are trying to use data from another drive encryption product...&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; yes. I used some old patched cryptoloop version from kernel 2.4 I  
&gt; think


http://clemens.endorphin.org/Cryptoloop_Migration_Guide

and this utility from Jari:


["binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1.c.bz2" (application/octet-stream)]

&gt;&gt;&gt;                    ^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I finally got it working by downloading the util-linux and util-linux
&gt;&gt; cryptoloop patch from the gentoo mirror, compiling it on the suse  
&gt;&gt; system
&gt;&gt; and running it from the compiled directory.   I don't know what  
&gt;&gt; the hell
&gt;&gt; is done differently but something obviously is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I downloaded util-linux-2.12b-cryptoapi-losetup.patch.bz2 from one  
&gt; gentoo
&gt; mirror, and that appears to be Ben Slusky's keygen patch. It is  
&gt; little bit
&gt; weird because it uses different key setup for interactive and
&gt; read-from-filedescriptor modes of operation. Interactive key setup  
&gt; appears
&gt; to be mainline util-linux compatible, but read-from-filedescriptor  
&gt; type key
&gt; setup reads up to 32 bytes of binary key material from file  
&gt; descriptor.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I wrote small converter program that reads up to 32 bytes  
&gt; of binary
&gt; key material from stdin and writes out loop-AES unhashed1 password  
&gt; hash type
&gt; compatible password to stdout. Source for binary-key-remap-to- 
&gt; unhashed1
&gt; program is attached. It can be compiled like this:
&gt;
&gt;   gcc -O2 -Wall binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1.c -o /usr/local/bin/ 
&gt; binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1
&gt;
&gt; And used like this (with loop-AES patched losetup and mount):
&gt;
&gt;   cat /etc/backup/aes.key | binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1 128 |  
&gt; losetup -p 0 -e AES -H unhashed1 /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb1
&gt;                                                            
&gt; ^^^                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;                                         number of bits in key (128,  
&gt; 192 or 256)
&gt; Or:
&gt;
&gt;   cat /etc/backup/aes.key | binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1 128 |  
&gt; mount -p 0 -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /mnt -o encryption=AES,phash=unhashed1
&gt;                                                                        
&gt;                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; Or, if you want to change password, like this:
&gt;
&gt;   cat /etc/backup/aes.key | binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1 128 | gpg  
&gt; --symmetric -a &gt;/etc/fskey-sdb1.gpg

Files default.kmap is there, folder modules-2.6.11.4-20a-default and loop.ko
is there, too. I guess the binaries loadkeys and insmod lack some libraries
or have been linked in an unusable way.

Is there more information I can give? I would like to get it working
properly as under SuSE 9.2 64bit before. En/decryption of pure data
partitions works fine with suse 9.3. There was no difficulty to set it up
again.

Build-initrd.sh config looked ok. Didn't look at kernel config because /lib
mount appears to be ok.

&gt; Command "/lib/loadkeys /lib/default.kmap" returned error
&gt; Command "/lib/insmod /lib/modules-2.6.11.4-20a-default/loop.ko" returned
&gt; error

Error message "Mounting /dev/sdb1 as /lib failed" means that /lib mount
failed. Above error messages mean that /lib was already mounted
successfully, but there is some userspace library dependence that causes the
failure.

Plan A
~~~~~~
Make sure that all programs copied to your USB-stick have their libraries
copied there also. As in 'ldd /sbin/losetup ; ldd /sbin/insmod' and so on.
At least Red Hat and Gentoo seem to ship ldd program that no longer outputs
proper path to the library file in all cases, and that causes
build-initrd.sh script to skip those libraries. I would not be surprised if
SUSE had adopted that same braindamage as well.

Plan B
~~~~~~
Can you try setting INITRDONLY=1 in build-initrd.sh config and manually copy
statically linked copies off all needed programs (losetup, insmod, loadkeys
and gpg) to your USB-stick.

To me it looks like built-initrd.sh didn´t copy ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 to

try again.
Thank´s for the hint with ldd.

Ok, now it works! It was file /lib64/ld-2.3.4.so that missed.

Kernel changes on SuSE 9.3 are bigger than on 9.2. Maybe that´s why the
bootup shows so many silly error messages.

I´d very much like to know how to tell the system that some modules are now
in the kernel and no longer to be looked for on the harddrive. Btw. I only
made absolutely needed changes to the standard kernel-config from SuSE. I
only ran make bzImage and did not compile all the various modules again. So
which command will resolve these little changes in module dependency? depmod
-???
And files like /boot/System.map-2.6.11.4-20a-default
or /boot/symvers-2.6.11.4-20a-x86_64-default.gz
what are they for? Should they be on my usb-stick too? What do they tell the
kernel to do?

Regards,
Peter

The symlink is not the problem here. Problem is that ldd program output
format was changed in incompatible way.

This is what ldd output used to look like on a sane box:

        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4001e000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

Notice how every library file dependence is preceeded by '=&gt;' in uniform
way. The build-initrd.sh script from loop-AES-v3.0c and older expect to find
that '=&gt;' before a file that needs to be copied.

I don't run Red Hat / Fedora distros myself, but I have been told that on
Fedora Core 3, the ldd program pukes out something like this:

        linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xffffe000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x42c2b000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x42c12000)

First line lists a dependency on some library file that does not even exist.
Score: 10 brain damage points. Third line no longer has that '=&gt;' that some
scripts expect to be there. 3 points.

OTOH, above ldd output format breakage seems to be well in-line with Linux
business model, which seems to be something like this:

1)  Intentionally make something incompatible or break some API.
2)  Find customers whose products or servers were broken by said change.
3)  Profit.

Anyway, below is a patch for build-initrd.sh script that makes it work with
sane old ldd output format as well as not-so-sane new ldd output format.

You may want to set kernel's soft block size to 512 bytes prior to trying
'dd bs=512' command. That is because kernel will send soft block size read
requests to disk driver regardless of what read size requests user space
program sends to kernel.

At least on my 2.4 kernel here, the default soft block size is always set on
first device open:

$ blockdev --setbsz 512 /dev/hda7       # use count now == 0
$ blockdev --getbsz /dev/hda7           # use count now == 0
1024
$ losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/hda7          # use count now == 1
$ blockdev --setbsz 512 /dev/hda7       # use count now == 1
$ blockdev --getbsz /dev/hda7           # use count now == 1
512
$ losetup -d /dev/loop0                 # use count now == 0
$ blockdev --getbsz /dev/hda7           # use count now == 0
1024

Above example uses loop device to bump up the use count of /dev/hda7
partition so that when blockdev opens that device, the open won't be the
first one, and the undesirable revert-to-default thingy does not apply.

In your case you may want to try something like this:

$ losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb11
$ blockdev --setbsz 512 /dev/hdb11
$ dd bs=512 if=/dev/hdb11 of=hdb11.dmg conv=noerror
$ losetup -d /dev/loop0

&gt; mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loopX,
&gt;            or too many mounted file systems
&gt;            (could this be the IDE device.....

Superblock data is badly damaged.
Try this on a *copy* of your encrypted data:

$ losetup -e AES128 /dev/loop0 hdb11.dmg
$ e2fsck -f -y -b 8193 /dev/loop0       # 1K soft block size file system
    or         ^^^^^^^
$ e2fsck -f -y -b 32768 /dev/loop0      # 4K soft block size file system
               ^^^^^^^^
$ mount -r -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /mnt/hdb11
$ losetup -d /dev/loop0

Forgot to mention that physically mounting your disk upside down (reverse
gravity) or storing it in refrigerator for few hours may increase your
chances of recovering your encrypted data. OTOH, those may kill the drive
as well.

Above dd command is completely wrong!

This time I looked at dd source, and learned that conv=noerror without
conv=sync will *remove* incorrectly read blocks from output. IOW, output
length will be shorter than expected, and that file system sector positions
will be incorrect.

Correct way to restore your data is something like this:

$ losetup -e AES128 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb11
$ blockdev --setbsz 512 /dev/hdb11
$ losetup /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0
$ blockdev --setbsz 512 /dev/loop0
$ dd bs=512 if=/dev/loop0 of=hdb11.dmg conv=noerror,sync
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
$ losetup -d /dev/loop1
$ losetup -d /dev/loop0

$ e2fsck -f -y -b 8193 hdb11.dmg        # 1K soft block size file system

&gt; find
&gt; that '=&gt;' before a file that needs to be copied.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't run Red Hat / Fedora distros myself, but I have been told that on
&gt; Fedora Core 3, the ldd program pukes out something like this:
&gt; 
&gt;         linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xffffe000)
&gt;         libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x42c2b000)
&gt;         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x42c12000)

Well I only have SuSE. From 8.1 to 9.3. I tried Debian once but I´m not
enough a pro on all that. So you are right. Either you are the one that
copes with all the mess SuSE makes or you have to pay. For big business
that´s ok, but I don´t see why I should have to pay over 100Euros every 6
months.
So above ldd looks like this on SuSE 9.3 64-bit:

files on the usb-stick:

        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002aaaaaaab000)

As you said the =&gt; is missing. Is it that way only on fc and suse or also on
debian? I´d wonder if the debian´s adopt to such a mess.
Another example is MPlayer. You get fine packages from
http://packman.links2linux.de. Up to recently, MPlayer could play almost
everything with running pics. Now, some super-hacker has compiled it without
support for wmv files. I have no idea why. Nor do I know how to rebuild it
from the source rpm. If you use 64-bit OS such mess comes up nearly every
day. There is not much software packed together. The SuSE distro is at least
a base. I would wonder if it is easier with fedora core or mandrake. Suse
has been sold out to novell and the dollarians will do everything to make
money before Bill Gaids comes away with his patents for double clicks all
over the EU.

 
&gt; Anyway, below is a patch for build-initrd.sh script that makes it work
&gt; with
&gt; sane old ldd output format as well as not-so-sane new ldd output format.

Ehm, I copied the missing library by hand to the stick. So I´d rather wait
for the next release of loop-aes instead of using the script below.

Peter

&gt; I accidently deleted my loop-aes-keyfile (ironically it happened while

&gt; Is there a way to restore my keyfile using the keys loaded into ram?

Encryption keys that are in kernel ram were hashed using one way hash and
are kept in expanded form. Unlike mainline cryptoloop, loop-AES
intentionally does not return the keys using an ioctl() call. Someone would
need to write a new kernel module to extract the data.

Plan A
~~~~~~
- Backup up your data
- Re-create the file system with new key file
- Restore from backup

Plan B
~~~~~~
- This only works for non-root file systems

- Edit /etc/mtab and remove loop mount option from old line:

/dev/hda7 /mnt ext2 rw,loop=/dev/loop0,gpgkey=/root/test1.gpg,encryption=AES128 0 0
^^^^^^^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  so that new line looks like this:

/dev/loop0 /mnt ext2 rw 0 0
^^^^^^^^^^

- When umount program reads above /etc/mtab line, it does not find 'loop'
  mount option there, and umount program will not automatically detach loop
  device from backing partition, /dev/hda7 in above example.

- Unmount the file system using the _loop_ device, like this:

     umount /dev/loop0

- Create new key file, like this:

    head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65 \
        | gpg --symmetric -a &gt;/root/test2.gpg

- Attach second loop device to same partition, like this:

    losetup -e AES128 -K /root/test2.gpg /dev/loop1 /dev/hda7
    
- Now you should have two loop devices to same partition, /dev/loop0 using
  old keys, and /dev/loop1 using new keys.

- Now re-encrypt that partition using 'dd' command reading from loop device
  with old keys and writing to loop device with new keys, like this:

    dd if=/dev/loop0 of=/dev/loop1 bs=1024k conv=notrunc

- And finally detach both loop devices from partition:

    losetup -d /dev/loop0
    losetup -d /dev/loop1

- Now you have new key file, and partition encrypted using keys from that
  new key file.

Agrree.. but in this case there's another porpouse...&lt;BR&gt;   How it 
works? Well.. there are something about a hundred machines using this 
encrypted-root filesystem, these systems are for public use. It would be a very 
hard work for me, going to put the passphase in each computer.&lt;BR&gt;   
In this case, i changed my strategy.. i'm using the encrypted-root just to avoid 
anyboby mounting the ide-flash as a slave device, but if anybody put it as a 
primary-master? what happen?! There's a script that check if that machine it's 
one of ours, if not, the ide-flash is formated.. (this last step is made by 
hardware).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   Hugo Marques&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;

Upgrading the compilation tools while trying to compile something is never a
good idea. :-) Glad it works, anyway.

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Changed gpg pipe code in losetup/mount to use '--no-options' instead of
  '--options /dev/null'. Fix from Lars Packschies.
- Changed losetup/mount programs to warn about unknown key data format.
- Added workaround for vanished QUEUE_FLAG_ORDERED define in 2.6.11-rc3-mm1
  kernel.
- Changed gcc command line parameter order to be same as in kernel Makefile.
  Wrong parameter order caused miscompilation with Xen architecture (2.6
  kernels).

bzip2 compressed tarball is here:

Greetings,

I accidently deleted my loop-aes-keyfile (ironically it happened while 
backuping it)
However, all loopdevices are mounted at the moment.
Is there a way to restore my keyfile using the keys loaded into ram?

(Hope to) Keep smiling

I tried with and without pre-empt and then with and without high-mem
i/o for drivers. No difference, random time to i/o error scsi
crashes, made worse by heavy scsi i/o. Thankfully going to 2.4.28
fixed it.

It was quite weird, running ssh sessions would continue to display a
prompt, running any command would complain that command could be
found as the root fs dissapeared. Even the running Arkeia GUI
(remotely viewed via ssh) would remain complaining that it could not
access the tape drive. I forget exactly what the message was, but
since the root fs was inaccessible no logs are available, and since
it was a panic everytime (as in get the server back online quick), I
did not take debug notes. My recollection is that on doing any
command it was "i/o error command not found". Even dmesg and reboot
did not work, not did any of the hotkeys like ctrl-alt-del.

Sorry I'm not more helpful, but it is a production machine with
0.5TB of data and I cannot try the experiment on it.

Hello,

   I'm running an encrypted-root filesystem with:
   - loop-AES-v2.1a
   - util-linux-2.12a
   - aespipe-v2.3a
   - dietlibc-0.28
   - gnupg-1.2.4

   It works perfectly, but i'd like to know if there's any way of =
supressing
the startup passphase from losetup and how can i do it. I've already =
looked
hard at google and tried changing  ../loop-AES-v2.1a/build-initrd.sh , =
but
no sucess..

   Thank you,

   Hugo Marques

hi all,

misusing linux-crypto for loop-aes only stuff again, but nobody ever
complained, so here we go:

i am using loop-aes on a debian/unstable machine just fine, it builds with
 current 2.6.11 kernels too.

i wanted to use loop-aes for testing purposes on my gentoo-linux
workstation (i386) but compiling failed, details and version numbers here:

http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.11-gentoo-r3/loop-aes_build-error.log

i applied loop-AES-v3.0b-20050212.diff.bz2 to the loop-AES-v3.0b sources,
but it did not help either. i'm trying to build against gentoo-kernel
sources, called "linux-2.6.11-gentoo-r3", changelog:

http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.11-gentoo-r3/ChangeLog

thank you for hints,
Christian.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Recently I've been mucking with Adaptec 29160 U160 cards on both a
Dual Xeon Dell Poweredge 2650 with 4GB of RAM and a dual Athlon
1.8GHz Tyan MPX motherboard with 4GB of RAM.

On the Dell box I was trying to get a new tape library on a new
29160 to coexist with the onboard AACRAID. I had all sorts of random
crashes one or two days into rebooting, and heavy disk I/O (such as
running the backup) would cause a crash sooner. The screen would be
left with i/o error message and the file systems would dissapear.

After much googling I discovered that people wiere having issues on
the 2.6 kernels with these two adapters... moved to 2.4.28 and
everthing is running nicely.

On the dual Athlon MP box I was trying to set up loop-aes partitions
and shredding the partitions or using the losetup method in the
loop-aes readme would cause the dd process to quit after a few
minutes. Again moving to the 2.4.28 kernel fixed the issue and the
SCSI disk seems more responsive as well. Note, this box has no other
SCSI adapters.

So just in case you are trying loop-aes on a box with aic7xxx
compatible card, be warned -&gt; use the 2.4 series kernels.

Best regards,

Hello friends

I'm using crypto loop on top of a mirroring soft raid device. However it
seems that the file system regularly gets corrupted, the used fs is
ext3.
Does anyone has experience with this scenario.

Attention list administrator.

Setting your list to be writable to anyone, on or off the list, is 
useless.  If you think that this is somehow welcoming to new questions, 
this is untrue.  A serious query almost never gets back to the sender 
unless the repliers specifically include them, and anyone serious about 
finding information should know how to subscribe to the list.  On the 
other hand, you allow the list address to be spammed, which wastes 
everyone's time and bandwidth.

Please turn off this 'feature', as it hurts more than it heals.

Regards,

Paul

Done.  This list (and most others) is now members-only.
Note that if you subscribed with another address than
the one you usually post from, you'll have to adjust.

It certainly is a big loss to not have Jari in this mailing list.
However, I don't understand the reason why he decided to unsubscribe
given that now only subscribers can post to the list. Can anyone shed a
light?

appears to be targetted with spam much more than the

It seems to me that to loose someone like Jari should be enough of a
sign that this should be an open list... Crypto people in general
know about and use tools such as anonymous remailers and have valid
reasons to keep their identity secret.

Use mozilla-thunderbird or be deft with that delete key. A few extra
delete key strokes won't hurt you.

As a loop-aes user, I now wonder where I have to subscribe to see
Jari's posts... as far as I can remember the most useful and prompt
posts are from Jari. Anyone with a clue?

Cheers,

OK, I've opened up the list again.  Let me know what the
list users decide on, and I will implement the decision.

Thanks, Rik.

Well, I think that we all agree than we shouldn't close the list to
non-subscribers if that means losing Jari.  (And some of us are opposed
to that, even if it didn't mean losing Jari.)  On the other hand, a lot
of us are sick of seeing all the spam on this list.  So what solutions
are there?  A few that I can think of are:

- non-subscribers are sent a confirmation email the first time they
  post to the list.  If they reply within xx hours/days, they get
  whitelisted, and their post, and all future posts, go through without
  any further action.  List members should be able to report the post as
  spam (because some spammers actually will reply to a confirmation
  email), in which case the email address is blacklisted.

- moderate the posts of non-subscribers.  I suspect that the list
  administrators won't be too thrilled about this one.

- "just hit delete".  This is the "let's just go back to the way things
  were" option.  I'm not a big fan of this one, but I'm including it
  just for completeness.

Any other suggestions?  Comments?

Given the nature of the list, is there any problem allowing posts from
non-subscribers providing they have a valid PGP signature...? Either
requiring PGP keys to be sent to the list admin, or that they must be
available on a keyserver? (The latter is less work for the admins, and
for this purpose I don't think it increases the problem at all.)

We're (lug-owl.de admind) running some (Mailman based) lists, at least
one with several hundred users. Basically, we use this scheme:

	- Automatically do some checks (eg. checking for viruses, ...)
	  and possibly throw away the email
	- Automatically accept mails from subscribers
	- Automatically accept mails from known-good non-subscribers
	- Put anything else on hold
	- Once a day (once each morning) I look through the backlog and
	  ACK real mails / drop SPAM. For known-good senders, I can here
	  switch it him/her to be a known-good sender (for being
	  automatically accepted in step 3)

Works well for us. Sometimes, other list admins look through the backlog
so that emails are probably delivered before the next morning...

MfG, JBG

Yes.  We are doing something like this for the local (campus) Debian
group.  We have some generic filtering which drops obvious spam and
viruses.  Subscriber mail goes through, as does anything coming from an
on-campus account (and some other frequent-posters-but-not-subscribed).
Everything else gets moderated.

The big question with this is how willing our mailing list
administrators are to do this once-a-day manual filtering.

(Rik has mentioned that they already do some spam filtering, but
linux-crypto seems to get quite a bit of spam anyways.)

One problem that I can see is that some people may want to post
anonymously (given the nature of the list).  Also, some people may
occasionally want to post something, but don't have access to their key
(e.g. posting from a public machine).

Then again, it may be a good idea to expedite PGP/GPG-signed mails --
mails that aren't signed and aren't from subscribers may need to be
moderated or confirmed.

&gt; (e.g. posting from a public machine).

True, those would be problems.

&gt; Then again, it may be a good idea to expedite PGP/GPG-signed mails --
&gt; mails that aren't signed and aren't from subscribers may need to be
&gt; moderated or confirmed.

That could also work. Particularly if you combine it with a white-list for
frequent non-subscribed posters (such as Jari). Although given what Jari
develops, I'd much prefer it if he signed all his posts anyway...!

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

OK, it sounds like a solution that would be acceptable to most people
(i.e. everyone who's said anything) would be something like:

- messages from subscribers automatically go through
- messages from whitelisted people automatically go through
- PGP/GPG-signed messages automatically go through
- replies to messages that already got through automatically go through
  (checked via the References/In-Reply-To header)  (We don't seem to be
  getting any automated replies and such on this list, so this should
  probably be safe, be feel free to disagree.)
- everything else gets rejected or held for further approval

To get onto the whitelist, there are some possibilities, depending on
what's easiest for the list administrators:

- obviously, we should initialize the list with people who already post
  frequently, if they're not subscribers.  The obvious one is Jari,
  although someone could look through the archive to see who else is a
  frequent poster.  (I say frequent poster because it would be sort of
  useless to whitelist someone who only sent one message back in 1985.)
- messages that fit one of the above acceptance criteria get their
  senders automatically added to the whitelist.  Maybe require N
  messages to be accepted.  For example, if I send 3 GPG-signed
  messages to the list, or 3 replies, then it's safe to assume that I'm
  a real person, and my address gets whitelisted.
- web-based signup -- enter your email address in a form, and it gets
  added to the whitelist. (pros: easy to set up; cons: less automatic)
- confirmation message gets sent to the sender, who must reply within a
  fixed time, otherwise the message is dropped.
- the admins could look over the held messages once a day, and whitelist
  the real messages.

These possibilities are, of course, not exclusive -- the administrators
could implement as many as they can.

That's my proposal.  If this sounds good to everyone else, I'll send
this to Rik.

Yes, I wonder what happened to HVR.

Yes, you can go back into the archives as far as you wanted.  It
wouldn't do any harm to add people who don't post any more.  I just
don't want to cause too much work for whoever's going to build the
initial whitelist.

Although I suppose we could build the initial whitelist somewhat
collaboratively...

So, suggestions for who to add to the whitelist are welcome. ;-)

They just do filtering with spamassassin.  Of course, most Debian lists
are fairly high traffic, so the signal to noise ratio is higher, even if
they might get similar amounts of spam as this list.

Well, a bunch of the junk on this list is some jerk using it as an
account email for Adobe and some other sites.  That wouldn't help in
this case.  But that gives me another acceptance criterion: auto-accept
messages with a really low score (say, -1.0 or something like that).

Mike&gt; - greylisting

Yes, that's a good idea.

Mike&gt; Another thing that might be interesting: I've seen there is a NNTP
Mike&gt; gateway.  Has it been checked whether this is the source of the

I really doubt it.  Spammers don't seem to care about NNTP at this
point.  (Although it shouldn't be too hard to check -- anyone who has an
archive of old posts could just need to look at the message headers.)

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Hi Rik,

It looks like the list has reached some sort of consensus on decreasing
spam.  Or at least nobody has complained about these suggestions.
Thanks to everyone who contributed their own suggestions.

What I'm proposing is that messages that meet any of the following
criteria are accepted:

- messages from subscribers
- messages from whitelisted people
- PGP/GPG-signed messages (if spammers start signing their messages,
  this can be made more strict -- e.g. signed messages with public key
  on a keyserver, etc.)
- replies to messages that already got through (checked via the
  References/In-Reply-To header)
- messages with a low SpamAssassin (or other spam filtering software)
  score

Everything else is either rejected, or held for further approval by the
administrators (depending on how much work this would create for the
administrators).  The administrators can also use greylisting [1] on the
messages that don't fit the acceptance criteria to pare down the number
of messages that require manual approval.  (I don't think messages
should be automatically approved if they pass the greylisting test,
since there is still a lot of spam that would pass.)

[1] e.g. http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/

Another way to pare down the number of messages for manual approval is
the re-check spam at a future time (say 30 min or 1 hour), and see if it
has a higher score.  (e.g. if it gets flagged by razor, etc.)  If so, it
gets dropped.

Obviously, some of the above suggestions are harder to implement than
others.  I'll leave it up to the administrators to decide which ones are
worth implementing.

The next issue is how to get addresses onto the whitelist.  The purpose
of a whitelist is to make it easy for people to send real messages
without too much interference.  Some possibilities are:
- obviously, we should initialize the whitelist with people who already
  post frequently, if they aren't already subscribers.  Obviously, this
  includes people like Jari.  Someone also suggested that HVR (who used
  to be very active on this list, but hasn't shown up recently) should
  be added.  A good criterion is to look through the archives and find
  all people who posted a message (or at least N messages) in the last,
  say, year.
- web-based signup -- enter your email address in a form, and it gets
  added to the whitelist
- any mail that gets held triggers a confirmation message to be sent to
  the original sender.  If the sender replies within some fixed time
  (say, one week), the message is accepted, and the sender is added to
  the whitelist.  Otherwise the message is dropped.
- messages that fit the above acceptance criteria get their senders
  automatically added to the whitelist.  Maybe require N messages to be
  accepted before the address is whitelisted.  e.g., if I the magic
  number is 3, and I send 2 replies, and 1 message that has a
  SpamAssassin score of -2, then my email address gets whitelisted.
- the administrators could look over the held messages periodically, and
  accept the real messages and whitelist their senders.

Again, some of these are easier to implement than others, and it is up
to the administrators to decide which ones are worth implementing.

There should also be some way for list members to get an address removed
From the whitelist, if some spammer address somehow gets added.  This
probably won't happen that often (hopefully), so this can probably be
done mostly manually.

Hopefully, this proposal strikes a good balance between eliminating spam
and other junk from the list, while keeping the list open to everyone
who wants to participate.

Thanks, Rik, for your work in running this list, and other lists as
well.

Would it be acceptable to have a "self whitelisting" system
here - ie. a "mailing list" that people can subscribe to,

Something like that can be implemented in minutes, using
the software that is already installed.

These two will be a bit harder, since ecartis only has a
blacklisting mechanism, but not a whitelisting one.

&gt; - messages with a low SpamAssassin (or other spam filtering software)
&gt;   score

This would let through a lot of the 419 mails, which seem
to be the bulk of the spam making it through the filters
currently.

Are you sure you want this ?

&gt; Everything else is either rejected, or held for further approval by the
&gt; administrators (depending on how much work this would create for the

Any volunteers ?

kind regards,

Thats the setup i use, before i used reiserfs instead of ext3 and
sometimes total system hangups occurred,..
have done something like fsck.ext3 -f /dev/loop* on your device?
Another interesting behavior: When i run the raid with only one of two
disks the corruption seems not to occur, but after rebuilding and
working with it the fsck.ext3 -f /dev/loop* prints some errors...

aagh, nevermind. it compiles! i don't know exactly what the reason for the

another console while compiling. never do this...

sorry for the noise, thanks for loop-aes,

I Agrree.. but in this case there's another porpouse...
 How it works? Well.. there are something about a hundred machines using
this encrypted-root filesystem, these systems are for public use. It would
be a very hard work for me, going to put the passphase in each computer.
 In this case, i changed my strategy.. i'm using the encrypted-root just to
avoid anyboby mounting the ide-flash as a slave device, but if anybody put
it as a primary-master? what happen?! There's a script that check if that
machine it's one of ours, if not, the ide-flash is formated.. (this last
step is made by hardware).

I may be bringing the old system back on line soon:
it is been in storage since 2002. I'll try to remember
to let you know when I bring it up again.

&gt;&gt; What I'm proposing is that messages that meet any of the following
&gt;&gt; criteria are accepted:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; - messages from subscribers
&gt;&gt; - messages from whitelisted people

Rik&gt; Would it be acceptable to have a "self whitelisting" system here -
Rik&gt; ie. a "mailing list" that people can subscribe to, but not post to,
Rik&gt; and subscribers from that silent list would be allowed to post to
Rik&gt; the linux-crypto list ?

That would be fine with me.  I guess if nobody complains about this, we
can go ahead with this.

Rik&gt; Something like that can be implemented in minutes, using the
Rik&gt; software that is already installed.

&gt;&gt; - PGP/GPG-signed messages (if spammers start signing their messages,
&gt;&gt; this can be made more strict -- e.g. signed messages with public key
&gt;&gt; on a keyserver, etc.)  
&gt;&gt; - replies to messages that already got through (checked via the
&gt;&gt; References/In-Reply-To header)

Rik&gt; These two will be a bit harder, since ecartis only has a
Rik&gt; blacklisting mechanism, but not a whitelisting one.

That's unfortunate.  I guess we can try it out without these, and see
how annoying it is to new people, although my guess is that it should be
mostly fine.

&gt;&gt; - messages with a low SpamAssassin (or other spam filtering software)
&gt;&gt; score

Rik&gt; This would let through a lot of the 419 mails, which seem to be the
Rik&gt; bulk of the spam making it through the filters currently.
Rik&gt; Are you sure you want this ?

In that case, probably not.

I don't know if there's any easy way to get stats on this, but is there
any reasonable cut-off point that would stop most of the 419 mails, but
let in a reasonable amount of real mail?  (Reasonable, so that it's
useful to actually implement it.)  I'm thinking of something like the
-1.0 or -2.0 range.

&gt;&gt; Everything else is either rejected, or held for further approval by
&gt;&gt; the administrators (depending on how much work this would create for
&gt;&gt; the administrators).

Rik&gt; Any volunteers ?

I wouldn't mind helping out.  Although I probably wouldn't be able to
take it all on (e.g. I may be out of town at some points).

The amount of spam that actually does get through doesn't seem to be
that much (and after we close the list, that should get rid of the guy
who's using the list address to sign up for various things), so my guess
is that this should only require a couple other people.

&gt; Wouldn't this be negated by the fact that you're initialising the
&gt; storage space for the ISO with /dev/urandom?  This would be a fairly
&gt; good guarantee that blank sectors (the most likely things to be
&gt; identical) are going to still be different.  I thought ISO images

&gt; blank sectors would be irrelevant.
&gt; 
&gt; And therefore, if you're not writing identical files in identical
&gt; locations, isn't the risk associated with reusing a set of keys reduced?

But why would anyone use same key file? There is no reason to do that.

Peter's point was to keep the weakest part on USB-stick so attacker would
not have access to it. The weakest part is the human memorizable passphrase
that protects symmetrically encrypted key file or private keyring.

Nothing prevents you from encrypting the per DVD key file using public key
crypto and storing the weak part (human memorizable passphrase encrypted
private keyring) to USB-stick. Simply point the gpghome= mount option to
USB-stick (auto-)mounted directory.

&gt;Note that whatever the file system is it won't be recognized
by most DVD burning software, it looks like a random data stream.&lt;&lt;

What I just have seen is, that there is also a problem with DVD-ROM drives
not recognizing a crypted DVD as a valid medium. It seems because there is a
random stream on it (at least it looks like it), the drive does think it is
garbage and won't allow me to mount. With the DVD-burner, it worked, but I
have that in a different pc than the crypto-setup
Does anyone know how to fix that? or are there some DVD-ROMS who will
recognize the DVDs?

&gt;&gt; The question is how much data fits on DVD? 4.0 or 4.4GB?
&gt;4,700,000,000 Bytes without overburn, about 4.4GB, my current images are
4699996160 bytes.&lt;&lt;

Oh. I never was able to manage to get more than about 4.1 GB on a DVD, since
bigger files caused NERO to warn me of oversized Image file...

About LOOP-AES and AES-PIPE (Why is it called AES anyway - from what I've
read, there are multiple ciphers avaiable not only AES) - are they in the
gentoo-library? I mean, can I install them with gentoos "emerge". I found
aes-pipe:

: emerge search aes
*  app-crypt/aespipe
      Latest version available: 2.2a
      Latest version installed: [ Not Installed ]
      Size of downloaded files: 72 kB
      Homepage:    http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net
      Description: Encrypts data from stdin to stdout.
      License:     GPL-2

but not aes-loop or loop-aes. I was wondering, if aes-pipe is there why not
the (required?) loop-aes? Or is it hidden?

The following is for Gentoo users:

You should really be using aespipe 2.3a. Portage has just not been
updated, I have an open bug on the gentoo bugzilla.

http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52046

You can prod them a bit to update portage...

In the meantime you can do the following as root:

1. Uncomment the PORTAGE_OVERLAY in /etc/make.
2. mkdir /usr/local/portage
3. mkdir /usr/local/portage/app-crypt
4. cp -r /usr/portage/app-crypt/aespipe /usr/local/portage/app-crypt
5. cd  /usr/local/portage/app-crypt/aespipe
6. cp aespipe-2.2a.ebuild aespipe-2.3a.ebuild
7. ebuild aespipe-2.3a.ebuild fetch
8. ebuild aespipe-2.3a.ebuild digest #after checking GPG sig
9. USE="static" emerge -pv aespipe

Loop-aes is not in portage since it involves building modules for
your kernel and writing and testing an e-build for every kernel
variant is difficult. Feel free to make an e-build if you can and
post to Gentoo bugzilla.

&gt;&gt; I use AES128 myself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; So that's &lt;safe&gt;?

there is no "safe" and "unsafe". 256bit AES is "safer than" 128bit AES and
ROT-13 is probably "safer than" plaintext-hidden-under-your-chair.
consider the importance of your data, the amount of cpu-power (aka
"money") of the people trying to get your plaintext and your willingnes to
exchange cipher-bits for speed..then you'll get a figure of what you can
consider "safe" for your system. i'm using AES128bit too, and Jari "Mr.
loop-aes" Ruusu also uses 128bit AES too...it can't be that unsafe, can it?

&gt; does the AES assembly optimization code included in loop-AES package 
&gt; is AES128-specific, or if it takes care of AES256 too ? 
 
The optimizations work for AES128 and AES256. When you upgrade from a 
previous version of loop-aes you will feel the increase of speed and the 
drop of cpu load while reading/writing from encrypted media. To make use 
of these features you need an AMD64 CPU and a 64-bit kernel. 
Even without figures and statistics: It´s impressive and worth trying.

loop-AES256 multikey-v3 slows down after hours of hard work, rsyncing 
from an AES256-v3 drive to an AES128-v1 drive. Has anyone seen this as well?

I add a top-printout, sorry for the control characters.

I made a drive using this setup:

offset=8192 encryption=AES256 multi-key-v3

Now, throughput on my rather weak Linux-running pentium 200MHz fell when 
upgrading from plain v1-AES128.  This is not surprising; however 
multikey-v3 also eats more processing power, am I right?

Is AES128 safe enough in your mind Jari; I see you use it in your 
examples in the README. Downgrading would give me better performance I 
suppose.

multikey v2 and v3 eat more processing power than v1.
AES256 eats more processing power than AES128.

I use AES128 myself.

Yep.

Hello,

does the AES assembly optimization code included in loop-AES package
is AES128-specific, or if it takes care of AES256 too ?

(it might seem obvious it works for both, but I want to be *sure*)

Thanks, ciao,

Hi all, 

     I'm trying to configure my linux box to use the loop-aes.  When I
run "make tests" after compile (make clean, make) and get the
loop-aes-utils debian package (that have the already packed mount,
losetup.. - btw, this available package could be informed into the
next loop-AES.README) the following error happens:

gn:u/usr/src/loop-aes/loop-AES-v3.0b#make tests

make: ** [tests] Erro 2
gnu:/usr/src/loop-aes/loop-AES-v3.0b# 

      I've googled but none error like these seems happened before.
Does anybody have some idea about what can being happening? The kernel
version is 2.6.10, GNU/Linux Debian testing machine.

  Thanks in advance,
Rodrigo Ferreira Baroni

Hi all!

    I've got resolve the problem and get the so expected message "***
Test results ok ***" ! :)

    I've installed the last loop-aes-utils and get the problem resolved: 
 bash# apt-get install -t unstable loop-aes-utils
 bash# apt-show-versions loop-aes-utils
loop-aes-utils/unstable uptodate 2.12p-2

   Before was installed the testing version: 

&gt; baroni@gnu:~$ apt-show-versions loop-aes-utils
&gt; loop-aes-utils/testing uptodate 2.12a-3
&gt; baroni@gnu:~$

   So Jari, consider apply in the README, adding the "apt-get install
-t  loop-aes-utils" to debian users to the last version of the
loop-aes (loop-AES-v3.0b) instead of patching the mount, losetup,..
commands. The 'make tests' show that is ok. Btw, I'll be running an
whole system very soon using that package with the loop-AES-v3.0b and
report any error/warning message to the list. If that not comes,
assume that everything is running sweet :)

Thanks Jari for the contribuition to the free-softaware.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

hi list, hi jari,

playing around with my new desktop distribution of choice, Gentoo linux
warns me about using "head -N" to show the first N lines of input. instead
one is supposed to use "head -n N":

/-----------
| $ make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux-2.6.10-gentoo-r7/
| head: `-1' option is obsolete; use `-n 1' since this will be removed in
| the future
\------------

is this so? if yes, these minor fixes could be applied.

thanks,
Christian.

Given that you rely on the packages for everything else, I don't see it

and there's LFS f.e. or those who use just the most basic slack

    Does you know the Debian policy about package maintainers? I don't
think so. EVERY package is signed by a gpg key of its maintainer;
EVERY package is analysed an have a bugtracksystem on-line in
bugs.debian.org; EVERY package only gets the testing after some time
in unstable, EVERY package is available by the Debian Quality
Assurance [qa.debian.org], .. etc, etc.  The GNU/Debian System is not
only a GNU/Linux distro, it is even more than this.

See by yourserlf the gpg key in the loop-aes-utils:

I hope you didn't bet any money on that :-)

in my opinion using a package system for security stuff decreases
security. i think it best to build the stuff directly from official
sources (note: i did not write latest official sources) - simply for
the reason that one doesn't have to rely on additionally trusting
others to some extend, even in times of gnupg and such. it's just an
unnecessary step (to save time), and it does not increase security -
so why take it in the first place?

your opinion obviously differs; you like the idea of having a neat
package ready for use, tested by others, its integrity assured by
others. that's all fine with me, and i know lots of ppl think that
way - or there wouldn't be such fame of package systems at all. but
please keep in mind there are folks who prefer to do things the perl
way ;) and i'm just one of them. if you look around there's plenty of
different ways of running unix systems out there, all for a reason.
best example with good docs would be LFS. that's not only something
for ppl with too much time on their hands, one can build a pretty
damn tight and secure system that way.

anyway, and more to the point of this thread's origin: if the latest
official sources had been used, and the examples in loop-aes.readme
followed by the letter, there wouldn't have been a problem. now
that's IF IF IF talking, but still, lots of ppl waste time over this.

what if it just seems to work one day...

&gt; Does anybody have some idea about what can being happening? The kernel

if I understand this right, you have just made a Debian package of
loop-aes-{modules,utils} and run the test before installing the new packages?
The test uses an older, patched (?) version of losetup and/or loop-aes
module. That might be the reason, why it fails.

BTW: Is loop-aes prepared to be torn into a deb upstream? (Jari?) If not,
I'd be interested, where you got it from, Rodrigo, since according to

http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=loop-aes&amp;searchon=names&amp;subword=1&amp;version=all&amp;release=all


there's only loop-aes 2.2d in testing/unstable at the time of writing.

 Mike

   Thanks for you reply. Sorry If I was not very clear, I'll try
explain better now:

      1) I've got the last-kernel-stable 2.6.10, configured it as
described in the README: (from my .config) and rebooted with it
       CONFIG_MODULES=y
       # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set
       CONFIG_KMOD=y
        # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set

       2) I've got the mount/losetup aes-patched version by
bash$ apt-get install loop-aes-utils      

       3) I've downloaded the  loop-aes and installed it:
bash$ wget -c "http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/loop-AES/loop-AES-v3.0b.tar.bz2"
bash# tar xjvf loop-AES-v3.0b.tar.bz2; cd loop-AES-v3.0b; make clean;
make [as root user]

       4) I've tested it
bash# make tests [as root user]
.. as so got that error (with some more lines now):

  It's not about waste time having to rely on additionally trusting

debian package that wasn't in  the original sources (but ok, we can't
ignore this possibility..). So, if time is not a problem since it is
not the main care (and I agree about that), we can get the original
sources and the packed's unpackaged (extracted - dpkg -x
&lt;package&gt;.deb) sources (wow :), see if it differs and if not, keep the
packaged installed - so we can have a system with the aes-loop-utils
mount/losetup managed by the packaging management system and keep
informed all dependents packages about it. (Jari, this can be informed
to the paranoids in the aes-loop.readme too ?)

  Err.. no. I love reinvent the weel :), but when you have the
possibility to configure and keep all packages managed by a powerful
(yes, dpkg/apt is powerful) centralized package management system in a
wonderful way, with a very nice BTS, and other things, sometimes that
way of administrate a package is more than a 'time safe' option.

Btw, thanks for you reply

Dla kogo pracuje Marek Belka?
Marek Belka zapewnia, i¿ nie mia³ nic wspólnego ze sprzeda¿± akcji PZU dla Eureko i \
BIG Banku Gdañskiego. Marek Belka by³ cz³onkiem komitetu doradczego ABN AMRO i nie \
doradza³ w najwiêkszej na polskim rynku transakcji z udzia³em ABN AMRO w roli \
doradcy.   
Równie interesuj±co Marek Belka opowiada o swojej roli (a dok³adnie jej braku) w \
dzia³aniach na rzecz Banku Millennium. Marek Belka twierdzi, i¿ nie doradza³ Bankowi \
Millennium w sprawie prywatyzacji PZU. Tyle, ¿e udzia³ Banku Millennium w konsorcjum \
nabywaj±cym 30% akcji PZU wykracza poza normalny zarz±d spó³k± i jest obszarem \

do³o¿yæ maksymalnej staranno¶ci przy ocenie takiego projektu - to jest jego \
obowi±zek, nie przywilej. Marek Belka chcia³by wmówiæ pos³om, ¿e w czê¶ci dotycz±cej \
prywatyzacji PZU Bankowi Millennium nie doradza³. To tak jakby twierdzi³, ¿e nie \

I have experimented with NSA's Security-Enhanced Linux via the
Gentoo-Hardened project.

I can run loop-AES in "permissive" mode, but in "enforcing" mode, mount(8)
is not able to read the password file from a file descriptor.

Does anyone else have an SeLinux setup with loop-AES?

&gt; In nearly every multi-key example a keyfile with 65 keys is used. Why do you
&gt; use exactly 65 keys?

Because version 3 on-disk format requires 65 keys. README section 2.6.

&gt; Every example I see in the docs uses AES128. Is there a reason not to use
&gt; AES256? (Of cource AES-128 will be secure for some time, but this is a reason
&gt; pro aes-128 and not against aes-256, because AES-256 is also for some time ;)

AES128 is a little bit faster than AES256

&gt; Example 2 uses a lot of head / tail stuff to manipulate the /dev/urandom
&gt; output. Why do I need this?

Key file needs 65 random keys, each separated by newline. The head / tail
pipe strips away uuencode header and footer which are _not_ random.

You won't lose the gpg encrypted key file if you put it to beginning of the
partition where your encrypted data is.

&gt; What about data corruption like zip-files suffers?

If ciphertext is corrupted, plaintext data is also corrupted. However, all
plaintext corruption stays within the same 512 byte sector because all 512
byte sectors are decrypted independently of other sectors.

&gt; I don't always treat my server nicely, sometimes it is shut down on the
&gt; power switch. Can my encrypted disk (ext3 on top of device backed loop)
&gt;   survive such treatment no worse than a regular ext3?

Encrypted ext3 survival is not any worse than unencrypted ext3.

&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, yeah, base freeze - I know. (Freezing the base-system, and waiting 
&gt; months for security support which is still not established or will be 
&gt; established in a foreseeable period is quite foolish)

There _are_ people looking after security updates in testing, even
though the security support is not yet official. Cf. recent mails to
debian-release by Joey Hess. What is still not established are auto-
builders for testing-security, AIUI.

&gt; Is there a blocker for not patching 3.0a into sarge's util-linux? 

Yes, mainly that I don't have time to do the backport, and to give the
resulting tools thorough testing. Considering that 2.X is very fine in
itself, I'd also say it's not worth the effort and the risk of adding
new bugs in the process.

&gt; (use base-components from sid in will raise the amount of work quite a
&gt; lot)

Not sure I understand what you mean here.

We are getting quite off-topic for linux-crypto with this, let's
continue in direct mail if you like.

I've constructed a program that uses SHA1, with a password and a nonce, to
get a challenge-response authentication system.

My question is, will there be any difference in the strength of the
authentication, between the two following scenarios:

1) The password and nonce are 8 bit, 16 character strings of random bytes
from /dev/random

2) The password and nonce are 8 bit, 32 character strings of random hex
digits derived from the same string in #1 above

Anyone have an informed opinion on this?

Thanks!

http://www.spinics.net/lists/crypto/msg02628.html states that loop-aes 
2.0f can't use multi-key encryption without using gpg-key also.

I use the latest, loop-AES-v3.0a (README of November 27 2004 ), but only 
swap-encryption reports multi-key-v3, losetup -a reports 'AES256' only 
for drives created with

    losetup -e AES256 -itercountk=300 ....

- so no multi-key-v3. Am I sitting on a timebomp (as Jari puts it), or 
does multi-key-v3 only appear with gpg-keys?

I didn't build (with) gpg because I want to have a change of recreating 
my data in case of loss of gpg-key. Could that be why 'make tests' 
fails? For the same reason I don't use password seed; it is also 
difficult to figure out how to do it, from reading the README.

Is the security level of my setup (AES256, no gpg, no seed, 
itercountk=300) to weak to bother?

Could you explain how the watermark attack work?

Greetings,

I'm still trying to set up util-linux 3.0a. The included patch seems to 
require util-linux 2.12i, but 2.12p seems to be the latest release. Thus I 
can either use 2.12 (without any letter) or 2.12p (both are useable with my 
distribution (debian), but not 2.12i as easy as the others.) 
Has anyone tried to patch util-linux != 2.12i? Are there any known problems?
(Well, there is a patched version of util-linux in debian already, but it 
supports only loop-aes 2.X)

Keep smiling

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

hello list,

apologies for abusing linux-crypto with loop-aes-only-related problems,
but it's my crpyto-solution of choice ;-)

now that multi-key-v3 is the preferred key-mode with loop-aes, i wanted to
"switch" from multi-key-v2 to multi-key-v3 using a linux-2.6 kernel.

reading http://www.spinics.net/lists/crypto/msg02814.html made me use
aespipe but i felt like making some changes to the syntax, because i had
no single-key setup and no "seed.txt". what i did was:

$ dd if=test.img bs=64k | aespipe -d -e aes128 -K ~/keys/sda8.gpg \
  | aespipe -e aes128 -K ~/keys/sda8-v3.gpg -w120 \
  | dd of=test.img bs=64k conv=notrunc

$ losetup -e aes128 -K ~/keys/sda8-v3.gpg /dev/loop0 test.img

but after this, i could not mount test.img (loop0) anymore - all data
seems to be gone (luckily i really did this on the test.img first, not
with real, valuable data).  (full log see below)

i wonder
- - how i misused aespipe
- - if this is the way to go, to change the cipher/passphrase/keyfile
  without reformatting the fs (i assume the answer is "yes")
- - how to figure out the right time to wait (aespipe -w) on large
  filesystems without testing first

thank you for your ideas. i could imagine this is somehow a FAQ and adding
the (right) answers to loop-AES.README (Example 7) would be fine. maybe
we'll have multi-key-v4 anytime soon and people have to switch again.

Christian.

What aespipe version did you use?

v3 on-disk format encrypting aespipe must be version v2.3a or later. As of
this writing, there is no later version.

Your "dd | aespipe -d | aespipe | dd" pipe looks ok.

&gt; - - if this is the way to go, to change the cipher/passphrase/keyfile
&gt;   without reformatting the fs (i assume the answer is "yes")

Passphrase can be changed by re-encrypting the key file, or by changing gpg
private key passphrase (public key crypto case). Cipher type or cipher key
length or key file content change requires re-encryption of the file system
data.

&gt; - - how to figure out the right time to wait (aespipe -w) on large
&gt;   filesystems without testing first

The wait is there only to prevent two aespipe programs asking two
passphrases simultaneously. If you can type first passphrase in 30 seconds,
then -w30 is enough.

&gt; maybe we'll have multi-key-v4 anytime soon and people have to switch
&gt; again.

No such v4 plans yet.

But ~/keys/sda8.gpg is already in v3 format. Typo?

&gt; [ NOTE: sda8-v3.key was generated as in Ex.2 in loop-AES.README, sda8.key
&gt; was generated following the loop-AES.README that came with loop-aes-v2.x
&gt; once. ]

Above "losetup -a" output says otherwise.

Can you provide output of following commands:

    gpg --decrypt &lt;~/keys/sda8.gpg | wc --lines
    gpg --decrypt &lt;~/keys/sda8-v3.gpg | wc --lines

First command should output "64" and second command should output "65".

no typo. i've generated sda8.gpg as described in loop-AES.README when
multi-key-v2 was "state-of-the-art" - however, i don't know the syntax
anymore. when decrypting manually, gpg says "CAST5 encrypted data" and
"WARNING: message was not integrity protected", the plaintext consists of
3904 bytes (whoops, too much info for an open mailinglist? *gg*)

&gt; Above "losetup -a" output says otherwise.

indeed.

&gt; Can you provide output of following commands:
&gt; 
&gt;     gpg --decrypt &lt;~/keys/sda8.gpg | wc --lines
&gt;     gpg --decrypt &lt;~/keys/sda8-v3.gpg | wc --lines
&gt; 
&gt; First command should output "64" and second command should output "65".

yes, it really does.

the thing is, i'ved used losetup (from loop-aes-utils 2.12p) to encrypt a
new "test.img" - thus multi-key-v3 seems to be available for sda8.gpg too.
but i've got real partitions here too, all showing up with multi-key-v2. i
can't just mkfs on it then. i'll try with a current aespipe again. thanks
for your input, i really appreciate your work.

Christian.

Hi Yanosz,

I usually follow the instructions to the letter - download, compile and install
just the specific binaries, and lock the util-linux on the system from
automatic updates. You won't break anything AFAIK when the system thinks it has
one of the other 2.12 series when you install the patched binaries using Jari's
instructions. I've never had any troubles.

Cheers!

You can find an updated patch on http://loop-aes.sf.net/updates/

&gt; (Well, there is a patched version of util-linux in debian already, but it 
&gt; supports only loop-aes 2.X)

I know :^)

A new version based on v3.0a and 2.12p is pending upload to unstable.
If you don't want to patch yourself or wait longer, you can find the
new package version here: http://debian.hinterhof.net/unstable/

Sarge is probably still going to include loop-AES 2.X. The update to
v3.0a would need a newer version of util-linux to make it into testing
first, and this is unlikely to happen before the release.

Regards,
Max

I'm posting here in the in the hope that someone can help (Jari?)

In any case, I was running loop-AES on two separate machines, my laptop and my 
workstation (loop-aes 3.0a, loop-aes-ciphers 3.0a, aespipe 2.3a, 
loop-aes-utils 2.12p, all built as debs) on kernel 2.6.9. I recompiled the 
kernels on both, removing loop and cryptoloop, as stated in the 
loop-AES.README. I created a partition (/dev/vg00/lv_crypt) and followed 
example 2 from the loop-AES.README. Mounted the partition, set up keys (65 
keys, gpg encrypted, stored on my USB thumb drive). Was able to mount the 
partition and copy my data over. Everything was copecetic, until I upgraded 
the machines to 2.6.10. Now when I try to mount 
the encrypted partition, I get 

[storm@volga ~]$ mount ../docs/
Password: 
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,
       missing codepage or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so

dmesg tells me

ReiserFS: loop0: warning: sh-2021: reiserfs_fill_super: can not find reiserfs 
on loop3

Even if I boot back into 2.6.9, the same indications occur. I upgraded to 
3.0b, and am getting the same indications. Anyone know why 
this is happening or a method to recover the info on the partition? Nothing 
changed on the machines other than the kernels and the loop-aes modules with 
the kernels.

funny no :)

&lt;joke&gt;
if the loop-aes users have the same logic than the loop-aes author, they 
should deduce that he intentionnally backdoored loop-aes.
&lt;/joke&gt;

i *obviously* dont believe it is true, it was just a funny bug.

&gt; Quote from loop-AES README file
&gt; "
&gt; Loop device encrypts data but does not authenticate ciphertext. In other
&gt; words, it delivers data privacy, but does not guarantee that data has not

&gt; that neither ciphertext, nor tools used to access ciphertext (kernel +

I've rewritten some CBC code to fit the facilities I introduce in my LRW
patch[1]. Here are the results for my P4@1.8GHZ:

loop-aes, CBC: ~30.5mb/s
dm-crypt, CBC prior to my rewrite: ~23mb/s
dm-crypt, CBC with my LRW patch: ~27mb/s
dm-crypt, LRW with my LRW patch: ~27mb/s (slightly faster than CBC)

As you can see my LRW patches (actually it's the generic scatterwalker
which is part of the LRW patch set) halves the gap to loop-aes. 

I'm sure dm-crypt is never going to achieve the speed of loop-aes.
That's just the price you pay, when you have to do things right and
clean, so they get merged into main. Kernel developers are choosey
customers, you know.

This looks promising.  I wonder if the generic scatterwalker solves the 
null encryption performance problem that was reported a little while back.

I've done some testing initially. The problem, at least with respect to
CBC, is that the NULL cipher's block size is 1. The CBC path isn't zero
originally and not even in my code (although I planned to do a zero copy
version). 

However, my patch will surely bring some relieve, as my scatterwalk code
does not give up the kmapping after every block, but wait for a page to
be completely processed. So that's one kmap/kunmap instead of 4096.

P.S.: The list of recipients have grown too long and topic moved a bit.
I will remove a bunch of people if I post another follow-up. Please
check the archive if interested and not subscribed.

The one who isn't funny is you.  This is all very tedious, meaningless 
pointscoring on an issue which is, actually, not very interesting to 
(I'd say) a lot of us on the list.  I'm not partisan in this, I've just 
had to put up with you and Fruhwirth stirring up trouble for a couple of 
days and I'd like you to stop.

Though I'm not an expert on the code nor have I read through all the 
previous arguments, I'd say that your '3-year old attack' is not an 
attack on the loop-AES package nor something that patching it can fix.  
Otherwise, presumably, you'd have submitted a fix for it like a good 
Open Source Citizen.  Since you don't seem to have done this, I can only 
assume you're just stirring up trouble.  It sounds to me like your 
attack would work equally well on other crypto packages that don't guard 
the kernel and its tools from intruders.

I'm not interested in replies, since I don't want to waste any more time 
listening to this kind of one-upmanship.

&gt;jerome etienne &lt;jme@off.net&gt; wrote:
&gt; i likely miss something. why using a encrypted fs if security isnt part 
&gt; of your requirement ?

Encryption = safety. A common misunderstanding.
I guess the question whether you use aes in CBC or LRW or else
implementation is of less importance for security of your data as the
question where you safe your keys and what passphrases you choose.
Encryption is one single utility to keep data away from intruders. You could
also hide your disk in some "secret" place or hide your data in mp3 files,
store it on removable medium to take it with you or else.
But doesn´t encryption benefit from the possibility to store your keys and
mount utils on removable medium so that nobody can temper them while you are
away? Mr. ING. Fruhwirth listed that loop-aes is vulnerable to modifications
to losetup and the utilities needed to set up an encrypted device. Sure, but
you have such probs allways and loop-aes comes very close leaving nothing
behind but an entirely encrypted drive that looks like shredded.
Would you start a brute force attack on a device where you don´t know if it
contains encrypted data or if it is just shredded or been exposed to intense
electomagnetic curls? Don´t forget, you can allways launch brute force
attacks. The question will be, attack on what?
Loop-aes leaves behind a boot sector with master boot record and a partition
table that tells attackers where the data is. As Mr. ING. Fruhwirth
explained it is possible to find blocks with same IV, right? Four partitions
with different setup will protect each other if attacker doesn´t know that
there are four, or more and where they start/end.
Or how about the idea to use several layers of loop-aes encryption? Using
one layer aes-256 and than one more with twofish-256 works pretty fine - you
don´t even have to know a bit about C.
Currently loop-aes uses 64 keys in multi-key mode. I guess it would be
possible to use more. As loop-aes can load and use other chiphers. Mr. ING.
Fruhwirth could write just a module with something else than CBC
implementation of aes. I guess I know why he does not.
http://clemens.endorphin.org/LinuxHDEncSettings is full of academics about
encryption but the whole site lacks installable code. So I don´t see the
problem. Loop-aes is ready and available, optimized for AMD64 and runs
stable on SuSE 8.2 - 9.2. dm-cryptoloop and it´s various "better"
implementations are in a pre-testing phase. Until aes in CMC or LRW or else
will become available to end-users I will have to use my phantasy and think
about how all traces of data can be removed to keep attackers from looking
for content.
Maybe "sniffing some more glue", Mr. ING. Fruhwirth, will give me the right
inspiration.

Peter

if i understand what you ask, as far as i know, nobody implemented the 
fix for this attack. Jari Ruusu said it was still vulnerable so i guess 
there is no patch.

if you care about this attack, a little google search pointed me to 
another way to automatically secure file, encfs, which seems to protect 
against this attack. it provides "per-data block MAC authentication 
headers : authenticate every byte of data in a file." which is the fixed 
i proposed when i published the paper.

it is pretty easy to code and may be done in a compatible way. moreover 
i think it could be a nice project.

&gt; &gt; I'm obviously doing something wrong, I just copied about 40MB of old
&gt; &gt; kernels (vmlinuz*) and some jpg files into a subdir on my cryptoloop
&gt; &gt; filesystem, and I measured 4252.2375kB/s realtime and 18819.7879 kB/s CPU
&gt; &gt; time. This doesn't seem unusably slow, even on my mighty P-II/350 and
&gt; &gt; eight year old 4GB drives. The hdb is so old it has to run in pio mode, to
&gt; &gt; give you an idea, and the original data was not in memory.
&gt; 
&gt; I've rewritten some CBC code to fit the facilities I introduce in my LRW
&gt; patch[1]. Here are the results for my P4@1.8GHZ:
&gt; 
&gt; loop-aes, CBC: ~30.5mb/s
&gt; dm-crypt, CBC prior to my rewrite: ~23mb/s
&gt; dm-crypt, CBC with my LRW patch: ~27mb/s
&gt; dm-crypt, LRW with my LRW patch: ~27mb/s (slightly faster than CBC)
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see my LRW patches (actually it's the generic scatterwalker
&gt; which is part of the LRW patch set) halves the gap to loop-aes. 

Actually I was using the built-in cryptoloop, not aes, I was just noting
that on a really slow CPU it's still usefully fast in my estimation.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure dm-crypt is never going to achieve the speed of loop-aes.
&gt; That's just the price you pay, when you have to do things right and
&gt; clean, so they get merged into main. Kernel developers are choosey
&gt; customers, you know.

Yes, I delighted that cryptoloop is in the kernel. The dm-crypt is an
interesting method suitable for technically adept users who do all their
own sysadmin and need better crypto to protect something very valuable or
illegal.

But for a company trying to protect information on laptops from casual
laptop theves, the existing cryptoloop is fine, and the greater complexity
of dm-crypt isn't cost effective. Speed isn't an issue, ease of use and
avoiding training costs is.

Your paper effectively says that "compromized box is insecure" which is like

well it is a valid argument if you assume the OS has been corrupted.
Nevertheless this assumption isnt mandatory, here is a scenario where it 
doesnt apply:
1. a user encrypt a whole removable disk with loop-aes
2. he goes in a conference and leave it unattended in a room (bad
    practice but it happen)
3. an attacker gets it, insert chosen data in it and put it back
4. the user replugs the removable device

=&gt; with the current loop-aes, the attack succeed
    o the modification goes undetected and the user uses attacker's data
      as if they were legitimate.
=&gt; with a loop-aes patched with authentication, the attack fails
    o it is detected by the authentication and the user can act
      appropriatly

my point is to make people aware of the security limit offered by the 
tool they use. After, they can do the knowledgeable decision to use them 
or not, depending on their own requirements. Thus they dont loose/leak 
important informations because they were not aware of those limits.

Hi Fruhwirth,

I don't want to take 'emotional' sides in this debate, but an
observation:

Re: "Enlightenment is a gift everyone has to fight for on it's own." If
I can contrast, Jari's code gets some good use/discussion because if a
question is raised, it gets answered *in detail* the same day (almost
always - I don't know how Jari finds the time). Now I am prepared to
accept your philosophy on life (to each his own) but OSS (open source
crypto even more so) lives (or dies) on the ability of the community to
support the software - and they will only do that if it can be
communicated effectively to the *users*. Now having been through your
web site (and most posts), I can see your interest in the subject, but
comments like this just don't help that communication!

I use loop-aes, and despite reading this debate each and every time it
comes up, not been convinced to change yet (still hoping for a
resolution and mainline merge though :-)).

Daniel.

Hello,

i dont understand the current argument so would prefere not to enter it. 
But it triggered my curiosity about current loop-aes security.
3 years ago i published a paper describing how an attacker would be able 
to modify the content of the encrypted device without being detected.
http://off.net/~jme/loopdev_vul.html

i was just curious about the current state of loop-aes. Is it still 
vulnerable to this attack ?

Quote from loop-AES README file
"
Loop device encrypts data but does not authenticate ciphertext. In other
words, it delivers data privacy, but does not guarantee that data has not
been tampered with. Admins setting up encrypted file systems should ensure
that neither ciphertext, nor tools used to access ciphertext (kernel +
kernel modules, mount, losetup, and other utilities) can be trojaned or
tampered.

Hi Jari,

Your crypto is good, your language is bad.

Clearly there is no intentional backdoor.
You do not gain any credibility by saying otherwise.

Next, confusing the kernel with util-linux is a strange trick.

Finally, in the time I maintained util-linux I have asked you
I don't know how often to come with a series of small clean
patches instead of a huge ugly all-or-nothing monolithic patch.
But you didnt.

Maybe you don't understand, but it does not suffice when code
is correct - it must also be maintainable.

Something rather similar is true for the kernel, I suspect.
A series of short clean patches would have solved all problems.

As it is, time may be running out - some years ago your stuff
was far superior to everything else. But alternative
approaches are being developed, and maybe loop-aes will soon
be some historic oddity.

Hi Andries et all,

As a loop-aes *user* and ex-cryptoloop user, I can tell you one thing - it
works, and is stable over multiple kernels, and backwards compatibility is
maintained as it evolves.

As for cryptoloop, I'm sorry, I cannot say the same. The password hashing
system being changed in the past year, poor stability and machine lockups are
what I have noticed, besides there is nothing like the readme here:

loop-aes.sourceforge.net/loop-AES.README

Regarding the "backdoor", perhaps it is a poor choice of words, but clearly
exposing yourself to the watermark attack on large volumes is unnecessary and
unwarranted. How would I, a security person, explain to my customer why I did
not choose the better crypto?

Every tried Jari's loop-AES module? For something maintained outside of

Perhaps if you implement something like FreeBSD gbde.

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gbde&amp;sektion=4

Until then I (and I am sure many others) will choose loop-AES because of its
clean set of instructions, strong multi-key crypto, on the fly multi key swap
or volume (/tmp for instance), easy instructions for GPG backed encrypted root
with key on USB dongle. Did I forget to mention tireless support by the author
of loop-AES?

I don't care to start a flame war, or to even participate in this one or the
politics of kernel code (I've gathered from the archives and elsewhere that the
author of loop-AES has tried repeatedly in the past to get his code in the
kernel), or to offend any kernel gods, but single key crypto for large volumes
is out of the question. Sorry.

Did you ever take a look at that page?!  
I did. I´d say the best are the photos. The rest isn
´t much of a help. 
Ever since I grabbed me SuSE Linux 8.2 and managed to  
compile some standard kernel according to the 
loop-aes.readme it´s proven to the world: 
You do no longer need to study "Computer Science &amp; 
Economics" to encrypt 200GB serial ata drives with 
128bit on AMD64 CPUs under linux. 
  
As there is no replacement for loop-aes to be found 
in the download section I´ll have to live with aes in 
its "weak" CBC implementation. 
Is there anyone out to think I´ll exchange 
AMD64-optimized, rock solid code &amp; working software 
for dm-cryptoloop? 
 
In case there are more complaints concerning loop-aes 
everyone is free to launch either fixes or reveal 
urls with something better at hand.

  Kernel patch versions were not affected (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).

Is this eventually going in the mainline kernel? I'd like to use it, but 
if I'm going to have to maintain my own crypto kernels indefinitely this 
probably isn't the one for me.

Hi Bill,

On a side note, I would say that this one is not particularly difficult to
apply, and Jari often includes up to date patches. Admittedly, when you want
to stick to an old kernel for a long time, it might become difficult. I've
been doing this for about 2 years now, and I cannot say that this one caused
me any nightmares yet. However, if it went into mainline, it would be better
of course !

Cheers,
Willy

Unlikely to go to mainline kernel. Mainline folks are just too much in love
with their backdoored device crypto implementations [1]. If you want strong
device crypto in mainline kernel, maybe you should take a look at FreeBSD
gbde.

You will find the same information on my site. Therefore, I do NOT
decline this vulnerability. I decline it's security implications. It's
on the same level as the vulnerability, that you will give away your
root password under torture.[2]

Nothing about kernel crypto is backdoored. If Ruusu thinks different, he
should show me source code. Till then, treat it as FUD.

&lt;off-topic&gt;
[2] I think the torture vulnerability is more serious than any
watermarking "attack". "Rubberhosing" can be fixed btw.
http://web.archive.org/web/20031214064240/http://www.rubberhose.org/
Unfortunately, original site is down and source code outdated.

excuse me, but that's just too academic for the end user. whatever
you're trying to say (apart from your obvious grudge against what
Jari is doing), it's not clear enough.

given the choices of dm-crypt, cryptoloop, and loop-aes it is awfully
clear what to use. your patches seem a bit like the cure to all and
everything which is suspicious like hell to me.


&gt; This document has been reviewed by a couple of noteworthy people, also
&gt; partially to counter the on-going FUD postings, Jari Ruusu has been
&gt; posting to LKML repeatedly.

FUD crap for heaven's sake!

(i'm calming down, not given an example of the fuss about md5
collisions lately.... you're not applying double standards are you?!)

first of all, when whatever people review a document the document
itself is not understood any better afterwards than its virgin
cousin. as far as i'm concerned this whole silly review thing serves
the author's sleep but not the end user, so it could have been
reviewed by mickey.mouse@duck.tales.org for its comedy (or lack
thereof by jim.carey@fun.guaranteed.net) ;-)

i'm not saying it's wrong, it's just that ppl don't get it who should
according to your way of communicating the matter.

btw, just being curious, but did/do you have something to add to
this?

maybe you're still just missing Jari's point.

http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/16/71



http://marc.free.net.ph/message/20040726.181150.d4b819be.en.html

yes, we know you replied to that message at
http://marc.free.net.ph/message/20040726.225933.cb46c940.en.html. and
there it is again: as an ordinary user i take it that you claim to
understand what Jari's point is _all along_ but yet you both fail to
communicate that clearly during the beginning of a discussion
(repeatedly as google assures me - for the fun of it?) and you yet
acknowledge that Jari's claims are legit. might i inquire why you do
so (plain and simple please it can't be that hard)?

all i see is you giving the ordinary user of crypto on linux systems
the impression that Jari's claims are untrue, and one should follow
you the hero that brings back strong crypto to mainline. everyone
else is too stupid too realise that, and so, please get going ppl.
makes me sick :(

i'm not talking about loop-aes being the best there is, it's just
that loop-aes is getting the job done. cryptoloop and dm-crypt fail
to do so, and yet you bash loop-aes instead of contributing your
academic knowledge to the project providing the best solution for the
end user so far.

which makes me wonder, there are 3 different crypto implementations
and still you had to come up with yet another one instead of being
able to somehow work together with (at least) one of the existing
ones... because of technical issues? i doubt it. loop-aes could have
been the ideal testing platform for your stuff.


&gt; James Morris: Can we please talk about the merge of my LRW patches soon?
&gt; The insecurity of CBC based encryption such as dm-crypt and loop-aes is
&gt; the reason why I have been pushing this patch so hard for the last two
&gt; months now.

several weeks back i got the impression those patches were to be
included into mainline really soon. what's the delay?

by whom have these patches of yours been tested? for how long, in
which environment? etc. "reviewed by funny people the ordinary user
doesn't know and there's no link one can check up on them on the page
reviewed" doesn't count for me i'm afraid.

i'm gonna stick to loop-aes, and sorry for the rant but i'm just sick
of wasting energy this way, kids.

@clemens: i'm not bashing your work, i'm ranting from an end user's
point of view.

if the security you get is "good enough" (for that user's purposes, and

they will use it. also there is nothing better at the moment (that is

as i said, if the alternative is unusable, whats the point? something is

That does depend on whether the something is actually making things worse
(by giving them a false sense of security) or not.

(This is totally unrelated to loop-aes or dm-cryptoloop, but an observation
borne of spending the afternoon reading Steve Gibson's pronouncements...)

loop-AES' README clearly states that it does not authenticate ciphertext,
and as such, does not protect against ciphertext tampering attacks.

Regarding attacks which insert chosen data:

Agreed, loop-AES (and all other block-level-encryption methods I know about)
do not protect against this attack, and were not designed to do so.

It raises an interesting attack:

1. Disk is encrypted

2. Inserted data satisfies watermark of
     (copyrighted material, top-secret plans, whatever)

3. Victim must reveal encryption keys to prove they do not
     have watermarked data.


The idea here is to insert a bit of data anywhere in the encrypted area that
will cause a "hit" for someone scanning for watermarks.

If the attacker inserted a plain-text document into the partition, it would
stand out as plaintext. The attacker can insert an encrypted document, which
will look like it belongs to the victim.

Victim could reveal encryption keys, show that with those keys the
watermarked document is still ciphertext (as the victim's key is not the
same as the attacker's key. If the attacker could insert data with the
victim's key then this attack is not necessary.)

Question: What do you insert where? My usb-stick is in my pocket, 
my drive remains at home. You can break a door and enter. You can 
steal and erase my whole drive - no doubt - 100% data loss. But 
please tell me what do you want to insert, and where do you want 
it? 
In case you intend to leave me a message behind that you broke my 
door just write me an email. 
 
Regards, 
Peter

yet you continue to stick the end user's nose into those hills and
mountains of enlightment (still largely to be fought for), knowing
for sure it won't do the end user any good.

so it seems to me that you're not interested in a mere end user's
feedback and even mock one's frustration about you communicating your
viewpoint.


&gt; To the rest of your slightly emotional post. Most of the question
&gt; have been already answered. I'm not going to restate my answers,
&gt; the archive has it.

so i won't get answers to the questions not answered in the archives.

at least that's an answer not dripping with ... stuff.


&gt; To your critiques of my reviewers: 
&gt; 
&gt; Your personal opinion has the same importance to me as the my
&gt; review sources have to you. That's none.

read my lips. humor is for the gifted ones, and for everyone else
there's smilies. to repeat my feedback, unwrapped this time: include
additional info about your reviewers, a link will do just fine.
there's the slight possibility that your site's visitors may benefit
from these links, because your site does a pretty good job of leaving
end users in the dark.

let me summarize, i did not criticise your reviewers, i still am
criticising you for not stating the above on your site. may i suggest
you do so in the near future?


&gt; What probably makes a different for others is, that the review
&gt; sources on my web pages includes kernel developers, regulars on the
&gt; dm-crypt mailing list and the IEEE chairman of Security in Storage
&gt; Working Group.

not all these ppl are ignoring end users - why are you?

you seem to be anxious to state these facts on your site, be it just
for clarity's sake. seems that hill of enlightment is a full-grown
mountain, so be it. i can't tickle you every now and then for helpful
information though.

not every plant is a flower, and not everyone considers hunting down
information (which common sense would expect in plain sight) a worthy
fight for enlightment (hint hint).


&gt; I'm sorry for my ranting ignorance. Life time is a limited
&gt; resource. Especially mine.

I guess this is copyrighted under the GPL. please mention that fact

If attacker knows that you installed distro X, and that distro installer
created /etc directory on your encrypted root partition at byte offset Y,
and installer placed directory entry for file /etc/hosts.deny at byte offset
offset Z, and if attacker has full physical acceess, then attacker can
overwrite encrypted data at byte offset Z with random junk. When that random
junk at byte offset Z is decrypted, the file name will decrypt to different
random junk, which is not /etc/hosts.deny . Being able to rename tcp wrapper
or firewall or some other important configuration file names does have
security impact.

If encrypted data is also authenticated, then decrypt code is able to detect
ciphertext tampering and output error message to kernel log and return I/O
error for that tampered data block. Unfortunately file systems do not deal
with I/O errors too well. ext3 file system for example appears to treat I/O
error on directory read as end-of-directory, and refuse to read any further.
So directory data tampering in authenticated case most likely results in
more files lost than just one or two files renamed.

good description of the attack. just a little precision, the attacker

&gt; You can find an updated patch on http://loop-aes.sf.net/updates/
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (Well, there is a patched version of util-linux in debian already, but it
&gt; &gt; supports only loop-aes 2.X)
&gt;
&gt; I know :^)
&gt;
&gt; A new version based on v3.0a and 2.12p is pending upload to unstable.
&gt; If you don't want to patch yourself or wait longer, you can find the
&gt; new package version here: http://debian.hinterhof.net/unstable/
&gt;
&gt; Sarge is probably still going to include loop-AES 2.X. The update to
&gt; v3.0a would need a newer version of util-linux to make it into testing
&gt; first, and this is unlikely to happen before the release.

Yeah, yeah, base freeze - I know. (Freezing the base-system, and waiting 
months for security support which is still not established or will be 
established in a foreseeable period is quite foolish)

Is there a blocker for not patching 3.0a into sarge's util-linux? (use 
base-components from sid in will raise the amount of work quite a lot)

The latest loop-aes, will do multi-key if the keys are piped to it via -p0. You
will need to ensure exactly 65 keys in the format generated via the commands in
the loop-AES.readme. See section 2.6.

You can use symmetric gpg support, then no public keys are used to encrypt the
~ stored keys. You could also use openssl and pam_mount, although I have not
done this in a while. http://www.flyn.org/projects/pam_mount/

Choose a strong password of known entropy - such as a 10 word diceware
passphrase with some extra tidbit thrown in. Your security is as good as the
passphrase and should deter most adversaries. See diceware.com for details. It
still won't protect from a watermark attack AFAIK.
|
| Could you explain how the watermark attack work?

Someone better qualified should do this, but here is some reading material.

Too weak. Avoid that kind of setup.

Watermarked files use special bit patterns that happen to trigger identical
ciphertexts. The number of consecutive identical ciphertexts can be
controlled and is used encode watermark.

But don't I need gpg-keys then? Perhaps I misunderstood the concept of 
multi-key-v3, is the keys actually gpg-keys? Of course I want a secure

&gt; 
&gt; Too weak. Avoid that kind of setup.
&gt; 
I suppose I can set a seed with 'losetup .. -S we23fef ...' or 
something? As the machine I want to encrypt is switched on and off every 
day, I will store gpg-keys and seed on hard disk or floppy (and put a 
copy 'somewhere safe').That equals security level 2) from your readme. 
The seed, being available to the attacker, is only good to force the 
attacter to discard his precomputed, nonseeded, dictionary list??

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Could you explain how the watermark attack work?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Watermarked files use special bit patterns that happen to trigger identical
&gt; ciphertexts. The number of consecutive identical ciphertexts can be

&gt; 

Venkat gave some good explaining links, thanks. I understand that some 
file (all zeroes for example) will give identical encrypted blocks on 
the disk. Consequently, our all-zero file must give different blocks 
upon encryption(?) But doesn't this give easier corruption; for example, 
zip-files gets easily destroyed because byte N depends of bytes 0 to 
N-1, and if byte N gets altered, N to Nlast are wrong.


I found that 'hdparm -W 0 /dev/hdx' is necessary to switch off the 
write-cache (http://lwn.net/Articles/67223/). Perhaps you should add 
this to your README.

Another thing I struggled with a while back, is the confusion around the 
cryptoloop/loop-aes that kernel 2.6.x contains. I thought your loop-AES 
equaled the kernel option, and supposed doing it 'your way' was getting 
obsolete after kernel 2.6.x integrated encryption in the kernel. I never 
got the 2.4.x-cryptoloop kernel patch to work, so I did it your way; it 
seems now that this is the superior method security wise.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;http://www.spinics.net/lists/crypto/msg02628.html states that loop-aes
&gt;&gt;2.0f can't use multi-key encryption without using gpg-key also.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; loop-AES-v3.0a mount and losetup can also read multi-key from file
&gt; descriptor specified with -p command line option.
&gt; 

But don't I need gpg-keys then? Perhaps I misunderstood the concept of
multi-key-v3, is the keys actually gpg-keys? Of course I want a secure
system, but I also would like to avoid kB's of random ascii data for the
case if they disappear, and only have my memorised password left (and
the encrypted partition).

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I use the latest, loop-AES-v3.0a (README of November 27 2004 ), but only
&gt;&gt;swap-encryption reports multi-key-v3, losetup -a reports 'AES256' only
&gt;&gt;for drives created with
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    losetup -e AES256 -itercountk=300 ....
&gt; 

So does the encrypted swap in fact use 65 random/"unknown" gpg-keys?

&gt; 
&gt; That loop device is not in multi-key mode. The -C option (itercountk= mount
&gt; option) has no effect in multi-key mode.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;- so no multi-key-v3. Am I sitting on a timebomp (as Jari puts it)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; The timebomb can explode only if someone uses version 3 multi-key file with
&gt; losetup/mount from loop-AES-v1.X or loop-AES-v2.X, or if someone uses
&gt; version 2 multi-key file with losetup/mount from loop-AES-v1.X.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, all is fine is you use latest losetup/mount.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I didn't build (with) gpg because I want to have a change of recreating
&gt;&gt;my data in case of loss of gpg-key. Could that be why 'make tests'
&gt;&gt;fails? For the same reason I don't use password seed; it is also
&gt;&gt;difficult to figure out how to do it, from reading the README.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Please post exact error message of 'make tests' failure.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Is the security level of my setup (AES256, no gpg, no seed,
&gt;&gt;itercountk=300) to weak to bother?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Too weak. Avoid that kind of setup.
&gt; 
I suppose I can set a seed with 'losetup .. -S we23fef ...' or
something? As the machine I want to encrypt is switched on and off every
day, I will store gpg-keys and seed on hard disk or floppy (and put a
copy 'somewhere safe').That equals security level 2) from your readme.
The seed, being available to the attacker, is only good to force the
attacter to discard his precomputed, nonseeded, dictionary list??

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Could you explain how the watermark attack work?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Watermarked files use special bit patterns that happen to trigger identical
&gt; ciphertexts. The number of consecutive identical ciphertexts can be
&gt; controlled and is used encode watermark.
&gt; 

Venkat gave some good explaining links, thanks. I understand that some
file (all zeroes for example) will give identical encrypted blocks on
the disk. Consequently, our all-zero file must give different blocks
upon encryption(?) But doesn't this give easier corruption; for example,
zip-files gets easily destroyed because byte N depends of bytes 0 to
N-1, and if byte N gets altered, N to Nlast are wrong.


I found that 'hdparm -W 0 /dev/hdx' is necessary to switch off the
write-cache (http://lwn.net/Articles/67223/). Perhaps you should add
this to your README.

Another thing I struggled with a while back, is the confusion around the
cryptoloop/loop-aes that kernel 2.6.x contains. I thought your loop-AES
equaled the kernel option, and supposed doing it 'your way' was getting
obsolete after kernel 2.6.x integrated encryption in the kernel. I never
got the 2.4.x-cryptoloop kernel patch to work, so I did it your way; it
seems now that this is the superior method security wise.

'make tests' complain about 'already existing directory', see attached

gpg --symmetric does not use a gpg key pair.

Yes, cryptoloop is borked. In fact I have not seen anything like loop-AES on
any other operating system.

When one is paranoid, one has to even take precautions against
attacks that involve examining the disk surface with a scanning
tunnelling electron microscope and even the the silicon oxide in
your RAM. Loop-AES implements key-scrubbing:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/crypto/msg02995.html

So now you can see how paranoid the thought behind the programming
that goes into loop-AES is. Thanks Jari!

Cheers!

Loop encryption keys are stored in gpg encrypted message. All you need to do
is to memorize the passphrase that can decrypt the gpg message.
losetup/mount/gpg programs do the rest.

Any key directly derived from human memorizable passphrase is almost always
weak. High quality random keys in gpg encrypted message are much stronger.

If you insist on storing the key file on the same partition as encrypted
data, then you can write the key file data to beginning of the partition and
specify an offset for the loop device. This example uses /dev/hda999 as the
partition:

Fill partition with junk

    head -c 15 /dev/urandom | uuencode -m - | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 \
        | losetup -p 0 -e AES128 /dev/loop0 /dev/hda999
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/loop0 bs=4k conv=notrunc
    losetup -d /dev/loop0

Put key file to beginning of partition

    yes "" | dd of=/dev/hda999 bs=8192 count=1 conv=notrunc
    head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65 \
        | gpg --symmetric -a | dd of=/dev/hda999 conv=notrunc    

Put this line to /etc/fstab

    /dev/hda999 /mnt999 ext3 \
defaults,noauto,loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,gpgkey=/dev/hda999,offset=8192 0 0

Create new encrypted file system

    losetup -F -v /dev/loop0
    mkfs -t ext3 /dev/loop0
    losetup -d /dev/loop0
    mkdir /mnt999
    
And then mount and unmount it

    mount /mnt999
    umount /mnt999

&gt; So does the encrypted swap in fact use 65 random/"unknown" gpg-keys?

swapon program creates 65 random keys based on data from /dev/urandom and
old encrypted swap data from same partition. swapon program talks direcly to
loop driver without gpg doing anything.

&gt; I suppose I can set a seed with 'losetup .. -S we23fef ...' or
&gt; something? As the machine I want to encrypt is switched on and off every
&gt; day, I will store gpg-keys and seed on hard disk or floppy (and put a
&gt; copy 'somewhere safe').That equals security level 2) from your readme.

You are better off using one of the examples in the README or above example.

&gt; The seed, being available to the attacker, is only good to force the
&gt; attacter to discard his precomputed, nonseeded, dictionary list??

Yes. The seed prevents *pre*computed dictionary attacks.

&gt; I understand that some file (all zeroes for example) will give identical
&gt; encrypted blocks on the disk.

Nope. But weak IV computation can be exploited so that two different
plaintexts will result in same ciphertext.

&gt; I found that 'hdparm -W 0 /dev/hdx' is necessary to switch off the
&gt; write-cache (http://lwn.net/Articles/67223/). Perhaps you should add
&gt; this to your README.

It depends whether the box gets its power from UPS or not. Write caching is
ok in the UPS powered case. It is exactly same issue on unencrypted case.

&gt; Another thing I struggled with a while back, is the confusion around the
&gt; cryptoloop/loop-aes that kernel 2.6.x contains. I thought your loop-AES

What about data corruption like zip-files suffers?

I don't always treat my server nicely, sometimes it is shut down on the 
power switch. Can my encrypted disk (ext3 on top of device backed loop) 
  survive such treatment no worse than a regular ext3?


I'll play more with loop-AES before moving data permanently to the 
encrypted disk, I'll also try your watermark examples.

I want to use encryption mainly because my data is no-one elses 
business. If someone send me an illegal mp3-file, I also want to be 
guarded against the copyright-police, which is pretty aggressive in Danmark.

This whole scenario is none of my problems. To start such an attack 
prerequesits that attacker knows a partition is encrypted and loop-aes 
takes guard of a suse distro. As I said. This scenario is unlikely. You 
could also blame loop-aes for not providing protection again a dd 
if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=64 ......... 
But you are creative! 
How about following: 
A small device that is to be plugged between harddrive and mainboard and 
monitors first 1GB of data when PC is started. All data I/O is recorded to 
a memory chip. Later attacker should be able to boot the pc by a playback 
of this first 1GB. 
Or how about pieces of hardware that fit into a keyboard and send all 
keystrokes via radiofrequency? I´d say software will never be able to 
secure a compromised machine. 
So your attack is rather an idea than a danger.

Sounds like something bad happened to your key file. Can you provide output

First 64 KB of reiserfs plaintext should be all zeroes. Following commands

I've written a program called fallback-reboot, found at
http://dcs.nac.uci.edu/~strombrg/fallback-reboot/  The client is in
python, and the daemon it connects to is in C, linked with -lcrypto.

I'm using SHA1 with a private key and a nonce, in an attempt to get an
authentication system that isn't subject to replay attacks.

However, I've made a choice, at least for the time being, that I have to
wonder about.  That is, when I'm SHA1'ing the private key and the nonce
together, I'm using a hexadecimal representation of these strings (because
it's easier to work with in C), rather than the binary form of the
strings.

The question then is, is this as effective as if I were to convert the
strings to binary, given that the data being digested has the same number
of bits of actual entropy from /dev/random (or similar) in either case?

Thanks!

&gt; I hope you are not using the same key file to

&gt; Re-using same key file for more than one file 
system will lead to 
&gt; identical

information. 
 
I must admit, I didn´t get that. Mkisofs -r dirtree 
builds an ISO image which I pipe through aespipe. You 
mean I shouldn´t use one keyfile twice for doing 
this? But you are not concerned that an attacker may 
find the key to the data in the first 8192 bytes? 
 
However. Top on my to-do-list is a short guide on how 
to master ISO images for DVDs with loop-aes and 
keyfiles not on the DVD. "Perfect deniability" 
prohibits storing encrypted data along with 
non-encrypted data on same medium. That´s why I´d 
rather prefer to remove mbr from harddisk and store 
keys + tools on removable media. 
 
My question is how example 3.3. from aespipe.readme 
has to be altered to build encrypted DVDs with 
keyfiles outside the DVD. The aim is to store larger 
amounts of data safely and compatible with the future 
but without cleartext on any spot of the medium. 
 
I tend to do this: 
 
3.3. Example 3 - Encrypted DVD-R 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Create 65 random encryption keys and encrypt those 
keys using gpg. Reading from /dev/random may take 
indefinitely long if kernel's random entropy pool is 
empty. If that happens, do some other work on some 
other console (use keyboard, mouse and disks). Use of 
gpg encrypted key file depends on encrypted swap. 
 
head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 
| tail -n 65 \ 
| gpg --symmetric -a &gt;/a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg 
 
 
Create encrypted ISO9660 DVD-R image that can be 
mounted using Linux loop-AES crypto package version 
3.0b or later: 
 
mkisofs -r directory-tree | aespipe -e aes128 
-K /a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg &gt;&gt;image.iso 
 
This image file can then be mounted under Linux like 
this: 
 
mount -t iso9660 image.iso /media/dvd -o 
loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,gpgkey=/a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg 
 
Or, after writing image.iso to DVD-R, like this: 
 
mount -t iso9660 /dev/dvd /media/dvd -o 
loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,gpgkey=/a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg 
 
Or, if this line is added to /etc/fstab file: 
 
/dev/dvd /cryptdvd iso9660

defaults,noauto,loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,gpgkey=/a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg

0 0 
 
What would you say about this? Will that dvd lock-up 
again when opening one of its folders containing some 
30,000 files in it? Will there be problems with reads 
at/after end of disk and such? 
Choice of high quality media is also an aspect, I 
know. Question is if above modification results in a 
well crafted image? 
Proposals &amp; critics welcome.

Peter

&gt; All code that runs in kernel space must be compiled using exactly same
&gt; kernel configuration.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) change kernel source -&gt; recompile kernel and all modules
&gt; 2) change kernel configuration -&gt; recompile kernel and all modules
&gt; 3) change C compiler -&gt; recompile kernel and all modules
&gt; 
&gt; Kernel configuration change that does not change compiler code generation
&gt; or
&gt; size of kernel structures probably does not need full recompile of kernel
&gt; and all modules. Full recompile+install is always the safest thing to do.

I must confess, I never did that. On all pervious versions of SuSE I only
made neccessary changes to boot encrypted root from usb-stick and only built
the kernel image + loop.ko. That´s it. So far it worked with the same
modules before and after. The latest kernel upgrade I made works fine, with
no modules recompiled.
But I´d like to know how to build a single module out of the kernel sources,
or refresh module dependencies for those parts that have been built into the
kernel. The SATA driver and IDE support had to be built in, for example.
My efforts towards booting from a cardreader and tiny SD cards were not
successful because my bios doesn´t recognize the cardreaders I could get so
far.

Regards,
Peter

OK all that makes sense and is helpful.

Perhaps I haven't had enough coffee yet (it's morning
here), but was that a "yes" or a "no" to my question?:

&gt; .. this [other] kernel 2.x.y for which you are
building &gt; the loop.o does NOT need to
&gt; be configured with CONFIG_MODULES=y and
&gt; CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n?
&gt;  
&gt; That is correct?

Hi there!

My harddisk has 390,716,865 sectors.
I installed it into the PC and partitioned it as part of the setup of SuSE
Linux 8.2 a while ago. Fine so far. What wonders me is the fact that only   
             390,684,734 sectors are used. So 32,131 sectors, which equals
16,451,072 bytes or 15.68 MB, are left free. But for what?
Is there a good reason why this space is left blank? Otherwise, can I erase
these sectors or set up a loop device on it? I have no idea what these
spare-sectors serve for.

Regards,
Peter

Long time ago, disks used cylinder/head/sector access to data. All modern
disks are addressed using logical block numbers. MS-DOS style partition
tables still use some fake cylinder/head/sector info for partitions. Usually
disk partitioning software creates partitions on full cylinder boundary.
Depending on that fake cylinder/head/sector setting, minimum disk space
allocation unit may be many megabytes. That may leave some partial fake
cylinders unused.

IOW, blame your disk partitioning software.

&gt; --- Ursprüngliche Nachricht ---
&gt; Correct way to prepare kernel sources + config for module building is to
&gt; build a kernel without installing the kernel + modules. Something like
&gt; this:
&gt; 
&gt;     cd /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27
&gt; 
&gt; Open Makefile and set EXTRAVERSION=-2-386
&gt; 
&gt;     mv .config z            # save config
&gt;     make distclean          # get rid of previous kernel compile junk
&gt;     mv z .config            # restore config
&gt;     make oldconfig
&gt;     make dep &amp;&amp; make clean
&gt;     make bzImage &amp;&amp; make modules

Do I really need "make modules" in case I use source of running kernel and
only just install loop-aes?
So far I just reconfigured the kernel .config and built a new image with
"make bzImage". Then I changed the kernel image, booted it and that´s it.
Why do I have to recompile hundreds of modules?

Peter

Now reporting success in building loop-aes from
sourceforge tarballs - my last post on this, only for
closure and for the benefit of future newbs.

All problems were solved by reading 
http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2003/05/msg00069.html

It was a simple omission.

Though I had rebuilt my 2.4.27-2-386 kernel with loops
off as 2.4.27.noloops, I had subsequently deleted the
source trees, which meant all the necessary info was
gone.  I then had downloaded and unpacked the source
for the 2.4.27 kernel (official debian in my case).
(Sourceforge tarballs for loop-aes and
loop-aes-ciphers were already unpacked).

All I then needed to do was:

# Boot into my 2.4.27.noloops kernel

cp /boot/config-2.4.27-2-386 \
/usr/src/kernel /source-2.4.27/.config; \ 

cd /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27; \
make oldconfig ;\ 	# this part I knew
make dep; \		# this part I DIDN'T know &lt;---

# Then open makefile and set EXTRAVERSION=-2-386
# because module is being built for 2.4.27-2-386
# and not for 2.4.27.noloops

cd /home/phil/loop-AES-v3.0d ;\
# or whatever the sources directory is for loop-aes

make clean ;\
make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27
KEYSCRUB=y ;\

# Then, to do tests, and to build loop-aes-ciphers:

# (I'd already built the patched utils.)

# Reboot into the original loop-enabled kernel
2.4.27-2-386

cd /home/phil/loop-AES-v3.0d;\
make tests ;\
--&gt; ***test results OK***	# !

cd /home/phil/ciphers-v3.0b ;\
make clean ;\
make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27 ;\
make tests ;\
--&gt; ***test results OK***	# !

---------------------------------------------
How easy that was. (No m-a fakesource). No doubt this
is not surprising to the old hands.

(A minor complication was that, since I had already
built loop-aes and loop-aes-ciphers from the Sid
debian sources against the loop-enabled kernel, and
although these were in a different location, I needed
to delete those modules (and run depmod I think)
before compiling loop-aes-ciphers - or there were
errors).

If any of this is wrong, please advise.

Hello,

I have implemented an bare bones Intrusion detection
system that currently detects scans like open, bouce,
half open etc and a host of other tcp scans.

I would like to develop this into a full blown IDS
which is capable of detecting buffer overflow attacks,
sql injection etc. 

I know how to implement buffer overflow attacks. But
how would an intrusion detection system detect a
buffer overflow attack. My question is at the layer
that the intrusion detection system operates, how will
it know that a particular string for exmaple is liable
to overflow a vulnerable buffer. 

Are there other open source firewall implementations
other than snort?

I would apprecitate it if you could let me know.
Thanks,
Vinay

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Through a series of unfortunate events I have lost my important
encrypted volume. The latest version of it was destroyed. A somewhat
older just deleted copy was undeleted from a server using debugfs on
ext2 filesystem. I also have a quite old copy archived on DVD using the
mondo backup program.

The undeleted encrypted filesystem was made on a 2.4 kernel box under
RedHat 7. A very old system. It was encrypted using the blowfish cipher.
I would provide exact kernel version etc. but I don't have the box
available to me at this instant. I can provide those details later if
necessary.

When I try to remount the file with -oloopback,encryption=blowfish I get
this error:

mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop1,

Question: Will debugfs refuse to undelete the file if any portion of it
has been overwritten by other disk activity? Or will it recover a
partially corrupted file and not say anything? The system was run in r/w
mode for a short time after the file was deleted but it was idle and
there was loads of free disk space. I am hoping the odds of part the
file being overwritten are slim. Unfortunately the encrypted version
looks like entropy so unless I go through all 2G of the file and look
for something obviously non-random I cannot know if the file has been
corrupted or if I am just doing something wrong.

I copied this file to another, much more modern system, FC3 running
kernel 2.6.10-1.741_FC3smp and tried to mount it after loading the
blowfish and cryptoloop modules and got the same results as above. Not
good. So I decide that maybe my bad luck is holding and the file really
did get corrupted somehow.

So I pull out an old set of backup DVD's made using Mondo and restore
the file from the DVD's. I try mounting it and get the same error as
above. I am positive the image on the backup set is good. So hopefully I
am just doing something wrong during the process of trying to mount it
but I don't know what it could be. I have always used blowfish
encryption for this and I have used the same password for the volume
(for better or worse) for years and it is programmed into my fingers.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

I might be wrong and this might be a stupid answer but... How about
iptables?
iptables blocks everything incomind, allows, deny and forwards, so I think
that is what you want?

Erm, if you know how some buffer overflow attacks work then surely the 
answer is "it depends on the application". To tell if an application is 
vulnerable you would have to audit it in some manner. Either by checking 
the source or doing some black-box testing on it.

Even if you did have a great big database of apps and had identifed 
which of them had possible vulnerabilities it would be easier to simply 
fix them rather than get an external system to disallow such inputs.

And not forgetting that you would have to have some way for your IDS to 
tell what app was running behind a specific port. Thought about that yet?

&gt; Are there other open source firewall implementations
&gt; other than snort?

Snort isn't a firewall. Don't mix apples and oranges. Snort is an IDS. 
The current de-facto "firewall" for linux is the iptables suite.

Cheers,

&gt;
Buffer overflow attacks vary, but have one thing in common.  The 
overflow string is much longer than what's usual for the app/protocol in 
question.  It may also contain illegal characters, but be careful - 
non-english users use plenty of valid non-ascii characters in filenames,
passwords and so on.

The way to do this is to implement a transparent proxy module for every 
protocol you want to do overflow prevention for.  Collect the strings
transmitted, pass them on after validating them.  Or reset the 
connection when one gets "too long".  For example, you may want to
limit POP usernames to whatever the maximum username length is
on your system.  But make such things configurable, others may
want longer usernames than you.

&gt;My question is at the layer
&gt;that the intrusion detection system operates, how will
&gt;it know that a particular string for exmaple is liable
&gt;to overflow a vulnerable buffer. 
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
It can't know of course, but it can suspect that 1000-character
usernames, passwords or filenames is foul play and reset the
connection.  Or 10k URL's . . .

I don't think buffer overflow has anything to do with transparent proxy. 
Transparent proxying is just doing some protocol filtering. Still the 
proxy code may have some buffer overflows. The best way is first to try 
avoiding any buffer overflows and take programming precautions. Other 
way is to chroot the services, if running it on a firewall. There are 
various mechanisms which can be used like bounding the memory region it 
self. Stack Randomisation and Canary based approaches can also avoid any 
buffer overflow attacks.
IDS runs on L7, best example is snort. Its not possible for IDS to 
detect these attacks accurately.

&gt; overflow string is much longer than what's usual for the app/protocol in
&gt; question.  It may also contain illegal characters, but be careful -
&gt; non-english users use plenty of valid non-ascii characters in filenames,
&gt; passwords and so on.
&gt;
&gt; The way to do this is to implement a transparent proxy module for every
&gt; protocol you want to do overflow prevention for.  Collect the strings
&gt; transmitted, pass them on after validating them.  Or reset the
&gt; connection when one gets "too long".  For example, you may want to
&gt; limit POP usernames to whatever the maximum username length is
&gt; on your system.  But make such things configurable, others may
&gt; want longer usernames than you.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; My question is at the layer
&gt;&gt; that the intrusion detection system operates, how will
&gt;&gt; it know that a particular string for exmaple is liable
&gt;&gt; to overflow a vulnerable buffer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; It can't know of course, but it can suspect that 1000-character
&gt; usernames, passwords or filenames is foul play and reset the
&gt; connection.  Or 10k URL's . . .

A transparent proxy is a protocol filter, which is why it is an
ideal way of detecting protocol-dependent buffer overflow attacks.

The detection code have to be built into the proxy, of course.

Examples:
A web proxy can check for anomalous long "get" request,
there have been web servers with buffer overflows when the
URL was too long.  The proxy can terminate such connections,
protecting the possibly vulnerable webserver.

An ftp proxy can check for (and remove) anomalous long filenames,
as well as funnies like "ls */*/*/*/*/*"

Similiar for many other services.  The proxy approach is useful
because knowledge of the protocol is necessary.  After all,
it is ok to up/download a huge file via ftp, while a 2M filename
is suspicious.  Size alone is not enough.

&gt; Still the proxy code may have some buffer overflows. 

A proxy (or any other attempt at a firewall) may have its own
holes of course, but avoiding making them isn't that hard.


&gt; The best way is first to try avoiding any buffer overflows and take 
&gt; programming precautions. 

Of course, if you have the source and that source isn't an
unmaintainable mess.  One or both of those conditions may fail,
and then the IDS becomes useful.

&gt; Other way is to chroot the services, if running it on a firewall. 

Provided it is an unixish server . . .

&gt; There are various mechanisms which can be used like bounding the 
&gt; memory region it self. Stack Randomisation and Canary based approaches 
&gt; can also avoid any buffer overflow attacks.

These may or may not be available.  You can always stick a proxy
firewall in front of the server though, no matter what os and
server apps it runs.

Proxies can be a good way of filtering but it can't avoid buffer 
overflows. It can only increase it. More code more bugs. If it is 
running on a hardware firewall as a service then its more dangerous as 
once it is compramised then IDS signatures also can be deleated :-). No 
use of IDS the right ?
So the best way is either make your code free of buffer overflows or use 
some library which controls the attack during any buffer overflow or use 
Stack Randomisation and Canary based approaches.

Yes they can - did you read and udnerstand my previous post at all?
A proxy _can_ avoid a buffer overflow by noticing the
anomalously large data item and simply refuse to pass
it on to the real server!  The proxy can terminate the tcp
connection and throw away the data.

&gt; It can only increase it. More code more bugs. 

Of course the proxy can be buggy too, but it is easier to
avoid problems there:
1. The server was written to perform a service, perhaps with
    security thrown in later.  (Yes, that's bad design.)
    A firewall proxy is written for security, so buffer overflows
    are usually avoided in the firewall proxy itself.  Because this
    is exactly what the firewall writer is thinking about.
2. The proxy may be much smaller and simpler than the server
    it protects, it is therefore much easier to audit for security
    problems.
3. Fixing the server is indeed best, but not necessarily an option.
    It could be proprietary, or written in a unknown language.

&gt; If it is running on a hardware firewall as a service then its more

"Hardware firewall" ???

&gt; dangerous as once it is compramised then IDS signatures also can be 
&gt; deleated :-). No use of IDS the right ?

A compromised firewall is of no use - sure.  So what? That applies
to any firewall, any IDS, or any server for that matter.

&gt; So the best way is either make your code free of buffer overflows or

Yes, but the server may not be "my code" at all.  Can't you see that
problem?  It may very well be someone elses code.  I may not have the
source, or the source may be useless for a number of reasons,
such as:
1. being written in a language I don't understand
2. Have a licence that forbids change
3. Need compilers/tools I don't have
4. Being such a nasty mess that writing a proxy is much easier
    than fixing the bloated ill-designed server code one
    unfortunately depends on for the time being.

In these cases, I can still protect my server with a proxy firewall,
although I can't fix the server itself.

&gt; use some library which controls the attack during any buffer overflow 
&gt; or use Stack Randomisation and Canary based approaches.

A library that controls any buffer overflow doesn't exist at all.

Stack randomization helps but don't solve all cases, the attacker
simply need code to search for randomly moved parts he need, pad with
a few megabytes of NOPs and things like that.  Of course, a proxy
can easily detect megabytes of NOPs and kill that connection . . .

But that "make oldconfig ; make dep" is not enough.

Correct way to prepare kernel sources + config for module building is to
build a kernel without installing the kernel + modules. Something like this:

    cd /usr/src/kernel-source-2.4.27

Open Makefile and set EXTRAVERSION=-2-386

    mv .config z            # save config
    make distclean          # get rid of previous kernel compile junk
    mv z .config            # restore config
    make oldconfig
    make dep &amp;&amp; make clean
    make bzImage &amp;&amp; make modules
    
Now you have kernel sources and all kernel compile time generated files
matching your kernel config in a way that can be used to compile more
modules.

    cd /home/phil/loop-AES-v3.0d

&gt; So far I just reconfigured the kernel .config and built a new image with

&gt; Why do I have to recompile hundreds of modules?

All code that runs in kernel space must be compiled using exactly same
kernel configuration.

1) change kernel source -&gt; recompile kernel and all modules
2) change kernel configuration -&gt; recompile kernel and all modules
3) change C compiler -&gt; recompile kernel and all modules

Kernel configuration change that does not change compiler code generation or
size of kernel structures probably does not need full recompile of kernel
and all modules. Full recompile+install is always the safest thing to do.

Thanks for setting me straight :-)

Clearly I need to do more reading, but the websites
I've been looking at never seem to spell all this out
in explicit newbie-proof steps. You get a piece of the
picture in one place and another piece somewhere else.

I've started working through
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/basekerncompat.html.
 
I note this actually tells you to force insertion of a
module even though it was compiled for a different
kernel version (!) (something Jari will probably
disapprove of!) (chpt 6):

" ..insmod has a -f option that "forces" insmod to
ignore the kernel version mismatch and insert the
module anyway. Because it is so unusual for there to
be a significant difference between any two kernel
versions, I recommend you always use -f."

Err.. one more question I need to check to be clear,
which may be even more ignorant than my previous
posts.

The running kernel at the time of building the module
must have been compiled with compiled with
CONFIG_MODULES=y
and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n.

If I am building the loop.o driver for some kernel
(for which I have a working config file ("z")) other
than the above running loopless kernel, I can download
the sources and do:

make distclean          # get rid of previous kernel
compile junk
mv z .config            # restore config
make oldconfig
make dep &amp;&amp; make clean
make bzImage &amp;&amp; make modules
cd /home/phil/loop-AES-v3.0d
make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/kernel-source-2.x.y
KEYSCRUB=y

Should config file z also have CONFIG_MODULES=y
and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n, or  is that irrelevant?

Hello to all.

    I burn in windows several cd and dvd, encrypted with crosscrypt
filedisk, AES256 but i can't mount any in my fedora core 3. I always
get an "ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument" error.

  kernel version: (uname -a)
Linux core3.mydomain 2.6.9-1.667 #1 Tue Nov 2 14:41:25 EST 2004 i686

    How i try to setup the loopback device
[root@core3 mnt]# losetup -e AES256 /dev/loop0 /dev/hdb

    I also check the kernel modules, and all is OK. I also install a

&gt; Correct way to prepare kernel sources + config for
&gt; module building is to
&gt; build a kernel without installing the kernel +
&gt; modules. Something like this:

An aside (I don't know how correct it is): I see that
this guide
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/x384.htm says
you can, if desired, CNTRL-C the kernel build after
the SPLIT line and it still results in the source
configured correctly for module building:

[root@pcsenonsrv linux-2.6.x]# make
CHK     include/linux/version.h
UPD     include/linux/version.h
SYMLINK include/asm -&gt; include/asm-i386
SPLIT   include/linux/autoconf.h -&gt; include/config/*
[cntrl-c]

Also on that page, the author seems (?) to
clarify/contradict his earlier statement about it
being desirable to force module loading when the
kernel version magic is mismatched.

insmod -f is intended for binary only modules which end user can't recompile

    make distclean
    cp YOUR_CONFIG_HERE .config
    make oldconfig
    make dep &amp;&amp; make clean
    make bzImage &amp;&amp; make modules

Always run "make distclean" before "make oldconfig". "make distclean"
removes .config file, so .config must be saved to some other file ("z") or
copied from elsewhere else.

&gt; Should config file z also have CONFIG_MODULES=y
&gt; and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n, or  is that irrelevant?

Configuration of kernel that you are compiling is irrelevant to your running
kernel.

&gt; [cntrl-c]

Above may work. I recommend full recompile without CTRL-c tricks.

Come to think of it, the author mentions in a
preceding chapter I think that his build discussion
only applies to modules distributed as part of linux.
Perhaps that's the same thing, but it's not as clear
as it might be.

&gt; &gt; Should config file z also have CONFIG_MODULES=y
&gt; &gt; and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n, or  is that irrelevant?
&gt;

That's what I thought but in truth I expected that I
had it wrong.  So you just need one (any) kernel
compiled with CONFIG_MODULES=y and
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n, and running that you can
compile loop.o drivers for some other kernel 2.x.y for
which you have the sources configured, however this
kernel 2.x.y for which you are building the loop.o
does NOT need to be configured with CONFIG_MODULES=y
and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n?

That is correct?

Any kernel that "works", i.e. supports your computer hardware and file
systems, can be used to compile any other kernel regardless of their
configurations. (Some really ancient kernel sources may require equally
ancient gcc + binutils versions, but that is not relevant here)

One pitfall is that if you compile and install differently configured kernel
that has exactly same kernel version and EXTRAVERSION (i.e. same `uname -r`)
as your running kernel, and insmod those newly compiled modules to your
running kernel, then you end up with modules running in kernel space but
compiled using WRONG configuration. Changing EXTRAVERSION in kernel Makefile
before compiling kernel is easy way to avoid this pitfall. That way newly
compiled and installed modules will not overwrite modules of your running
kernel.

Compiling kernel+modules using same `uname -r` as your running kernel, but
NOT installing them, is not a problem.

Hi,

is it possible to use loop-aes with newer via cpus that can speed up
en/decryption through the hardware?

Hi all,

I have been experimenting a little bit with loop-AES and a 200GB Maxtor 
disk. I have made a partition (formatted with reiserfs 3.6) /dev/hda1 
(200GB) and encrypted it with loop-AES 3.0b (AES256), multi-key. I have 
Samba sharing it, so I can use it on my Windows machine over the 
network. All this works just fine, but after some time I can get an 
error message in Windows saying that there is an I/O error on the 
device. I get this when I try to copy/use/move a file on the partition. 
I have tried to access the file in Linux too, but then I just get 
"permission denied" even if I'm root.

Running fsck on the loop-device finds corrupt files and tells me that 
the only way to fix this is to run --rebuild-tree. I tried this once, 
but that just didn't work resulting in a totally corrupt filesystem.

I read in the loop-AES README-file that write cache should be disabled. 
I have hdparm -W 0 /dev/hda in rc.local (should it be here?), but I'm 
not sure how to check if this is actually turned off after booting. Is 
this the way to turn off write caching? Something else I should disable?

Anyway, I have tried a couple of times to re-format and setup the 
encryption on the disk; always resulting in the same problem after some 
time of usage. The last thing I tried was to partition the disk into two 
partitions 100GB each. I copied files to the partitions. /dev/hda1 was 
okey when I ran fsck on it. Then when I ran fsck on /dev/hda2 I 
encountered some corruptions. I thought I could just copy over the files 
from /dev/hda2 to /dev/hda1 and just leaving the corrupt ones. This 
seemed to work, but after the copying, when I ran fsck on /dev/hda1 it 
contained corrupt files as well. Even if there was only one files, which 
was corrupt on /dev/hda2 (this was not copied to /dev/hda1).

Does anyone have any ideas what might be wrong in my setup? I can supply 
you with additional information if you need, because I'm not sure what 
might be useful to know.

Lastly, I mount the disks manually with:
losetup -e AES256 -K /path/to/enc.key /dev/loop6 /dev/hda1
mount /dev/looop6 /mnt/disk1

and unmount with:
umount /mnt/disk1
losetup -d /dev/loop6

Just recently I realized that it might be good to do the fsck too, but 
I'm not sure at which point this should be done. As I have it now, I 
have a script which automatically sets up the loop, fscks the partition 
and mounts it. Is this a good approach or when should you fsck the 
partition? What about unmounting the disks, should something special be 
done or is umount /mnt/disk1 &amp;&amp; losetup -d /dev/loop6 enough?

I would appreciate any kind of help in this matter, because it is really 
bugging me to always get corrupt partitions after some time of usage.

Thanks for a great mailing list!

Best regards,
Tommy

Disabling write cache only helps in unexpected electrical power lost
situations. UPS powered boxes with automatic shutdown are better off with
write cache enabled.

&gt; I have hdparm -W 0 /dev/hda in rc.local (should it be here?), but I'm
&gt; not sure how to check if this is actually turned off after booting.

hdparm -I /dev/hda

&gt; Is this the way to turn off write caching?

Yes.

&gt; Does anyone have any ideas what might be wrong in my setup?

Can you rule out RAM problems?
Does memtest86 run ok?
Is this on brand new computer?

&gt; I can supply you with additional information if you need, because I'm not
&gt; sure what might be useful to know.

Kernel version?
gcc version?
ATA chipset info? Some Silicon Image SATA controllers are really bad.

&gt; As I have it now, I have a script which automatically sets up the loop,
&gt; fscks the partition and mounts it. Is this a good approach or when should
&gt; you fsck the partition?

I recommend that mount is used to set up the loop by passing loop=
encryption= and gpgkey= mount options. That way umount will detach the loop
automatically on automatic UPS-battery-running-out-of-juice shutdown.

Fsck can be run manually if needed (after unclean shutdown).

&gt; What about unmounting the disks, should something special be
&gt; done or is umount /mnt/disk1 &amp;&amp; losetup -d /dev/loop6 enough?

That is enough.

Hi,

Thanks for the quick reply! I'll try to give some answers to the questions.

I have not tried to run memtest for a while, but the server has been in 
use for quite some time as a firewall. I just connected the disk to it 
to test loop-AES. But, I would say for 99% that the memory is okey. I 
tested it when I got the server. It is an old IBM with two PII/333MHz. 
Nothing special. Anyway, I wouldn't think that this is the problem, 
because I have had the same problem in another machine, a PIII.

&gt;  
&gt;
This is from dmesg:

Is this what you wanted to know?

I just tried to do some more tests with the partition with corrupt files 
and I was really surprised that a file, which was corrupt (I couldn't 
delete it as root or move/rename it) was okey and I could delete it. Now 
another file was corrupt instead. What is going on here?! I have not 
even touched the files since I wrote the mail to the mailing list, so 
I'd suppose the same file, which was corrupt in the previous fsck would 
be corrupt now as well. Any ideas or comments? Could it be a problem 
with Reiserfs?

Sounds to me like a disk problem. We recently had a bunch of failed
200GB SATA Maxtors with 16MB cache in a RAID array. The Maxtors
seemed very sensitive to ambient temperature (we suspected the disks
had been temperature stressed although client clains an ambient room
temperature of 75F), were purchased in Jan of this year. Install
bonnie++ and run it on the disk without encryption and with just
reiserfs, see if the disk dies or you have error messages. The
non-dead maxtors in the array died with between 4 and 30 hours of
stress testing in a room with an ambient of 65F... the conclusion
was, that once stressed, the disks are on their way to failure, it
was just a question of time.

Okey. I have installed bonnie++ and run quite many test runs using 
different configurations. No problems at all; the disk works like it 
should. I have not done any 30 hour tests, but a few hours was no 
problem at all. I really do not think this is the problem.

That sounds like some file metadata was corrupted while it was read from
disk platters to kernel ram. That bad metadata seemed to persist because
kernel cached that corrupted data. Eventually that cached data was dropped
because kernel needed that ram for something else. On new read from disk,
all went ok.

Any chance you could test using ext3 file system?

you could post this to the ReiserFS list (reiserfs-list@namesys.com) to
find out more about the errors and its severity (or you could wade through
the sourcecode by yourself). then you can think about using their support
offer: http://www.namesys.com/support.html

&gt; Nothing special. Anyway, I wouldn't think that this is the problem,
&gt; because I have had the same problem in another machine, a PIII.

"have had" or "have"? can you take the disk to another machine and
reproduce the same errors? does

% dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=8M

work without errors? (please check the syslog!)

Is that PIII a SMP or uni-processor box?

My test scripts have now hammered reiserfs on multi-key-v3 encrypted
loop-AES on 2.6.8.1 kernel for almost 24 hours now. SMP kernel but run on
uni-processor box. Zero errors so far.

Tommy,
I am going to need far more detailed instructions how to reproduce these
errors, including full kernel config and a test script that can reliably
produce these errors.

Assuming /dev/hdb is the cd you burned from crypt.iso,
perhaps I'm missing something but I'm not sure that
losetup line is the correct way to set up a loop
device from an encrypted cd? dmesg says it's looking
for a FAT filesystem.

Does the one-step mount line as per the README work?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear Crypto experts,

I am a big fan of the loop-aes module since about one year now. I got
root encryption running on several linux boxes with suse 9.1 and suse
9.2 so far. I now own a new laptop (Samsung x20) and would like to root
enrcrypt my freshly installed suse 9.3. I followed your readme file and
got all working fine, i.e. swap encryption and partition based
encryption. However, following example 7.5 for the root partition
encryption left me with a non-booting system. I retried the whole thing
now three times, with the same result every time. Here is what my boot
process console output sais (at least as far as i can read it):

TCP: Hash tables configured (established 131072 bind 65536)
NET: Registered protocol family 1
ACPI weakup devices:
PWRB RP01 LANC MODM
ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun
md: ... autorun DONE
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
VFS: Mounted root (minix filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 204k freed
Mounting /dev/hda2 as /lib failed
md: stopping all md devices.
md: md0 switched to read-only mode.
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
~ Firmware: 6.1
~ Sensor: 37
~ new absolute packet format
~ Touchpad has extended capability bits
- -&gt; multifinger detection
- -&gt; palm detection
input: SynPs/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio4

then the boot process comes to a halt. If I press any key it appears on
the console, so the system does not actually freeze. Neverlethess, the
only thing i can do then is reboot, which will end at exactly the same
situation. My guess is that the line "Mounting /dev/hda2 as /lib failed"
is a clue to what is going on, but I am not savvy enough to understand
here what is meant and how I can fix that.

Here is my partitioning setup:
hda1 = 1.5G swap
hda2 = 50M /boot (ext3)
hda5 = 5G /      (reiserfs)
hda6 = 10G /home (reiserfs)

The compiling of the kernel and the loop.ko module went fine. All tests
run successfully (make tests, actually encryption swap and /home works
fine.)

I read about a Suse 9.3 issue and build-initrd.sh not dealing too well
with the messed up ldd output. So I checked that all libraries of
insmod, loadkeys, losetup [and gpg/aespipe] are there. I appears however
that the two libraries ld-linux.so.2 and libc.so.6 were copied
correctly. I did not find any other dependencies when running ldd manually.

I can send my build-initrd.sh and my .config for kernel compilation if
that is of any help to you.

I hope that my problem is not a real problem and that someone can help
me with this.

Cheers,
Jochen

[snip]
&gt; hda2 = 50M /boot (ext3)

"Mounting /dev/hda2 as /lib failed" is the relevant error message here.
Possible reasons why mount failed: (1) ext3 file system is not compiled to
kernel as built-in, (2) ide drivers are not compiled to kernel as built-in,
(3) BOOTTYPE=ext3 in build-initrd.sh configuration may be wrong.

&gt; I read about a Suse 9.3 issue and build-initrd.sh not dealing too well
&gt; with the messed up ldd output. So I checked that all libraries of
&gt; insmod, loadkeys, losetup [and gpg/aespipe] are there. I appears however
&gt; that the two libraries ld-linux.so.2 and libc.so.6 were copied
&gt; correctly. I did not find any other dependencies when running ldd manually.

Above mount system call failure happens before insmod + losetup + their
libraries are used. Which means that missing program or library does not
cause above error message, but some other error message later on.

&gt; I can send my build-initrd.sh and my .config for kernel compilation if
&gt; that is of any help to you.

Compressed kernel .config and build-initrd.sh configuration part (comments
and shell script code removed) of will help. Also, mention what version
loop-AES you are using.

Hi,

I'm new in linux file system and I'm trying to modify the ext2 fs to
encrypt/decrypt files on the fly without using cryptoloop.

I think I can intercept write/read file operations to encrypt/decrypt
inner/outer buffer.

Maybe another solution is to encrypt/decrypt page just before/after the
page is written to/read from the block device:
Sync_page:
{
	If (page will be written)
		Encrypt_page
		Send_blockdev_request
		Decrypt_page to get decrypted page in cache
	Else (page will be read)
		Send_blockdev_request
		Decrypt_page
}
In this case I'm wondering if I can just intercept the sync_page
operation to do such a work. As the request block operations are
buffered in a queue what could happen when a read and a write request
are performed in same time (I don't known if it could occur)?=20
What do you thing about that ? Could you help me please ?

Thanks,

David

Best to use loop-aes.sf.net (see readme there for a detailed howto)
which supports multi-key crypto, and I have used it with reiserfs and
ext3 without any issues on software raid etc., as well as encrypted
multi-key swap, ephemeral /tmp etc.

Single key crypto (afaik dm-crypt as well the last time I checked) is
susceptible to the watermark attack... It has been discussed many times
on this list, see http://mareichelt.de/pub/texts.cryptoloop.php for a
start, and search the list archives.

Mr Venkat Manakkal recommends me to use the loop-aes in multi-key mode instead of \
dm-crypt because it is more secure. So I will use it on my kernel2.6.10 and with an \
ext2 fs.

You might also find the discussions on loop-aes on the Gentoo Forums at
forums.gentoo.org to be useful... just search for loop-aes. Gentoo now
installs the loop-aes patches for util-linux by default on the
development version (~x86 ~amd64 etc) and had an "emerge loop-aes" to
build the loop module for your installed kernel. Additional goodies such
as the hardened compiler etc make it a good choice for your server.

&gt; Thanks for all
&gt; 

You might also find the discussions on loop-aes on the Gentoo Forums at
forums.gentoo.org to be useful... just search for loop-aes. Gentoo now
installs the loop-aes patches for util-linux by default on the
development version (~x86 ~amd64 etc) and had an "emerge loop-aes" to
build the loop module for your installed kernel. Additional goodies such
as the hardened compiler etc make it a good choice for your server.

A google search brought up:

Which version of Linux are you running on this processor? I'm assuming
it is a MIPS distro:

http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Distributions

My guess is you will have to compile util-linux by hand and replace the
mount and losetup symlinks of busybox with actual programs, in addition
to compiling the loop-aes kernel module loop.ko for the kernel you are
using, for which you will need sources.

loop-aes definitely can mount encrypted CD/DVD usind FAT, EXT2/3 or other
filesystems
I am not sure if it works with crosscrypted isos, too!
&gt; &gt; [root@core3 mnt]# losetup -e AES256 /dev/loop0
&gt; &gt; /dev/hdb
&gt; &gt; Password:
&gt; &gt; ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
That looks the loop device is setup wrong. You don´t need a keyfile or
passwordfile (-K or -p)?
If crosscrypt doesn´t work, i.e. is incompatiple with v3 format of loop-aes
you can still encrypt CD/DVD images with linux.
Anyway, let me know if crosscrypt is really compatible with loop-aes!

Regards,
Peter

&gt; 
&gt; Assuming /dev/hdb is the cd you burned from crypt.iso,
&gt; perhaps I'm missing something but I'm not sure that
&gt; losetup line is the correct way to set up a loop
&gt; device from an encrypted cd? dmesg says it's looking
&gt; for a FAT filesystem.
&gt; 
&gt; Does the one-step mount line as per the README work?

Current version does not use via cpu crypto instructions. Adding support is
not a big job, but I need either (1) fully tested patch from someone else or
(2) normal-user ssh access to a box with such cpu.

&gt;&gt;It is an old IBM with two PII/333MHz. Nothing special. Anyway, I wouldn't

&gt;&gt;another machine, a PIII.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Is that PIII a SMP or uni-processor box?
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
It was a dual PIII 500MHz, but I do not have it any more.

&gt;Tommy,
&gt;I am going to need far more detailed instructions how to reproduce these
&gt;errors, including full kernel config and a test script that can reliably
&gt;produce these errors.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I'm currently doing some more indepth tests to be able to give better 
details about the problem. I'll also try to use ext3, and when I'm done 
I can post the findings on the mailing list.

Meanwhile, if you (Jari) want me to provide you with additional 
information just tell me what you need. I can send you everything except 
a test script, which reproduces the problem (I'm currently working on this).

Best regards,
Tommy

Russia to an European
private Bank where the final crediting is expected to be
carried out. While I
was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement
in politics by
financing the leading and opposing political parties (the
Union of Right Forces,Led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a
liberal/social
democratic party Led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat
to President

A google search brought up:

Which version of Linux are you running on this processor? I'm assuming
it is a MIPS distro:

http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Distributions

My guess is you will have to compile util-linux by hand and replace the
mount and losetup symlinks of busybox with actual programs, in addition
to compiling the loop-aes kernel module loop.ko for the kernel you are
using, for which you will need sources.

Thank you for this flash into the past. I remember "disc geometry" and "chs
values" from ancient BIOSes.
So today I could set up 16 primary "partitions" by using losetup and
/dev/loop0 to /dev/loop15, mount them in folders and encrypt them. Fine:-)

Peter

&gt; &gt; My harddisk has 390,716,865 sectors.
&gt; &gt; I installed it into the PC and partitioned it as part of the setup of

&gt; only
&gt; &gt;              390,684,734 sectors are used. So 32,131 sectors, which
&gt; equals
&gt; &gt; 16,451,072 bytes or 15.68 MB, are left free. But for what?
&gt; &gt; Is there a good reason why this space is left blank? Otherwise, can I
&gt; erase
&gt; &gt; these sectors or set up a loop device on it? I have no idea what these
&gt; &gt; spare-sectors serve for.
&gt; 
&gt; Long time ago, disks used cylinder/head/sector access to data. All modern
&gt; disks are addressed using logical block numbers. MS-DOS style partition
&gt; tables still use some fake cylinder/head/sector info for partitions.

&gt; disk partitioning software creates partitions on full cylinder boundary.
&gt; Depending on that fake cylinder/head/sector setting, minimum disk space
&gt; allocation unit may be many megabytes. That may leave some partial fake
&gt; cylinders unused.
&gt; 
&gt; IOW, blame your disk partitioning software.

&gt;
&gt; Yes they can - did you read and udnerstand my previous post at all?
&gt; A proxy _can_ avoid a buffer overflow by noticing the
&gt; anomalously large data item and simply refuse to pass
&gt; it on to the real server!  The proxy can terminate the tcp
&gt; connection and throw away the data.
&gt;
Some of the validations can be done at proxy end. But there are more 
invisible scnarios than the simple visible ones. And its definately much 
preferable to use Apache like stuff then using our own........I hope u 
agree with me...
I don't disagree on proxy doing the filtering and validations what I 
mean to say is it can't garantee avoiding buffer overflows. As it itself 
can be a source for it.

&gt;&gt; It can only increase it. More code more bugs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Of course the proxy can be buggy too, but it is easier to
&gt; avoid problems there:
&gt; 1. The server was written to perform a service, perhaps with
&gt;    security thrown in later.  (Yes, that's bad design.)
&gt;    A firewall proxy is written for security, so buffer overflows
&gt;    are usually avoided in the firewall proxy itself.  Because this
&gt;    is exactly what the firewall writer is thinking about.
&gt; 2. The proxy may be much smaller and simpler than the server
&gt;    it protects, it is therefore much easier to audit for security
&gt;    problems.
&gt; 3. Fixing the server is indeed best, but not necessarily an option.
&gt;    It could be proprietary, or written in a unknown language.
&gt;
No. As ur the only user of ur program, means resources is limited to 
visulize all senarios for all protocols. No one would like to keep on 
adding the proxies for the sake of buffer overflow. Is basically taken 
as a facility for filtering.

&gt;&gt; If it is running on a hardware firewall as a service then its more
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "Hardware firewall" ???
&gt;
Yes embedded firewall. When ur gateway is protected by firewall device. 
Another one is a software firewall sol'n.

&gt;&gt; dangerous as once it is compramised then IDS signatures also can be
&gt;&gt; deleated :-). No use of IDS the right ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A compromised firewall is of no use - sure.  So what? That applies
&gt; to any firewall, any IDS, or any server for that matter.
&gt;
No its not true as one ur frewall is compramised, it can effect other 
services also. But at the same time if any of the servers is compramises 
only that server is effected.

&gt;&gt; So the best way is either make your code free of buffer overflows or
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but the server may not be "my code" at all.  Can't you see that
&gt; problem?  It may very well be someone elses code.  I may not have the
&gt; source, or the source may be useless for a number of reasons,
&gt; such as:
&gt; 1. being written in a language I don't understand
&gt; 2. Have a licence that forbids change
&gt; 3. Need compilers/tools I don't have
&gt; 4. Being such a nasty mess that writing a proxy is much easier
&gt;    than fixing the bloated ill-designed server code one
&gt;    unfortunately depends on for the time being.
&gt;
&gt; In these cases, I can still protect my server with a proxy firewall,
&gt; although I can't fix the server itself.
&gt;
Again it will be ur own code with limitation of taking care of all 
scenarios. Take an example....Id we are trying to add a web proxy and 
using apache as our server. Do u say that code written by us will be 
more safe than apache ? :-)

&gt;&gt; use some library which controls the attack during any buffer overflow
&gt;&gt; or use Stack Randomisation and Canary based approaches.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A library that controls any buffer overflow doesn't exist at all.
&gt;
Its there and available. Just need to search.

&gt; Stack randomization helps but don't solve all cases, the attacker
&gt; simply need code to search for randomly moved parts he need, pad with
&gt; a few megabytes of NOPs and things like that.  Of course, a proxy
&gt; can easily detect megabytes of NOPs and kill that connection . . .
&gt;
Its not easy to have an attach with Stack Randomization. Like TCP syn 
randomization.

Right after sending this email it occurred to me that I could run

 Sure enough right at the very beginning of the file is what looks like
a bash history file. If it weren't for bad luck I would have no luck at all!

So it looks like it comes down to my ancient backup from DVD. Strings on

anything else because I am sure the backup is good. So I am really
scratching my head over why it won't mount.

Hello everyone,
I need to modify some CRYPTOGRAPHY code in Linux Kernel to get a specific 
VPN behavior, but I don't know where to start.

The situation is the following:

I have a VPN gateway (Linux kernel 2.6.10 with Openswan 2.3.1 installed). I 
have only installed the user land tools from openswan package in order to 
use the native ipsec stack in the kernel.
I have 30 laptops equipped with Windows XP configured to launch secure 
tunnels towards the VPN gateway (so I have 30 tunnels). The laptops can 
communicate securely VIA the gateway and everything works fine but..

the problem is the following:

Each packet sent from a given client to the other get processed 4 times 
(encryption at the sender, decryption at the gateway, encryption at the 
gateway, decryption at the receiver). This is the normal behavior but it 
imposes too much processing overhead on the linux VPN gateway. The required 
behavior is that the VPN gateway just RELAYS encrypted data (ESP envelopes) 
without decrypting them. This is impossible in the current ipsec 
implementation since"the end of a tunnel HAS ALWAYS to be decrypted".

Note that this required behavior can be achieved by launching a tunnel from 
each client to every other client making the VPN gateway 
transparent..BUT..this would mean 900 tunnels!! instead of 30, so it is not 
the answer.

What I am looking for is the portion of the C code in the kernel where the 
Decryption function is called to decrypt a received packet. When I find this 
statement, maybe i can make it conditionnal such as:  If the destination is 
me then Decrypt  else DO NOT!

I hope that someone can help me with finding this portion of the code and 
modify it. By the way I searched in the kernel file "esp4.c" but can't seem 
to find what I want.

Hi all - a few questions about some options in the build-init.sh script
that comes with loop-aes.

When using a gpg key to encrypt the drive, do the following options
effect the security of the drive?

# Optional password seed for root partition
#PSEED="-S XXXXXX"

# Optional password iteration count for root partition
#ITERCOUNTK="-C 100"


Meaning, even with a gpg key, should I have a 10000 iteration count and
a strong (20+ chars, upper, lower, numbers, etc...) password, even
though this password is not the one I have with my key?  I want the
drive secure!

Thx,
David

Hi everyone

I'm trying to upgrade to a 2.6 kernel and am finding some problems. I keep 
the rootkey.gpg on a usb drive. I followed all the steps for recompiling the 
kernel in the README. (Fortunately I also kept my previous 2.4 kernel on the 
file and configured syslinux to allow me to boot from it. : ) )

The trouble is that the system boots the new kernel and then complains:

Mounting /dev/sda as /lib failed

Some googling reminded me that the naming convention for devices changes 
with 2.6: so I tried editing my /boot/initrd.conf so that  it read

CRYPTROOT=/dev/discs/disc0/part1 (formerly /dev/hda1)
BOOTDEV=/dev/discs/disc1  (formerly /dev/sda?)

I am pretty much guessing concerning the second device name; how can I find 
the new correct name for /dev/sda if I cannot boot the 2.6 kernel?

But even if I get past this hurdle, I find myself in a catch-22 situation: 
trying to run buildinitrd.sh (needed because I changed /boot/initrd.conf) 
fails with an error message stating that it cannot find the device nodes:

This
***  script was supposed to create block device nodes for     ***
***  BOOTDEV=, CRYPTROOT= and possibly EXTERNALGPGDEV= but    ***
***  lacked knowledge of how to create at least one of them.  ***
***  Script aborted.

How can I get buildinitrd.sh to succeed in configuring the initrd for use 
with a 2.6 kernel while still running a 2.4 kernel?

I don't know if this helps, but I don't have devfs support enabled in my 
kernel config.

I would be grateful for any help on this.

Best

Marvin

Hello All, 
 
What is a good way to stress test a loop-AES file-backed loop to see if I can make it fail? 
 
Since Jari advises against using file-backed loops, I would like to test how much risk is involved 
in using the file-backed loop. 
 
Thanks!

Try lots of writing to the file backed loop file system:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/mountpoint/foo bs=1024k

If that doesn't trigger it, then start some fatware programs (openoffice +
mozilla) that eat lots of RAM, and then try again.

Deadlocks may happen when kernel is running out of free RAM, and kernel
memory allocation routines attempts to flush dirty RAM pages to backing
store.

not necessarily. the naming convention is derived from the devfs 
filesystem, introduced in 2.3.x iirc and to be obsoleted again pretty soon 
in 2.6 [1]

for general linux-2.6 question, a good starting point is:

 &gt; find the new correct name for /dev/sda if I cannot boot the 2.6 kernel?

"sda" with devfs is /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0 here. but /dev/sda 
should also do.

hm, either you're using devfs, which should create the devicenodes by 
itself (not?) or you can create the nodes with mknod(1). but i've never 
done such things.

Hello,

Thanks for your help on this.

You were right and I should keep using /dev/sda; indeed the device name is 
not the problem

&gt;Observe boot kernel boot messages. If some device is not detected, it may 
&gt;be
&gt;caused by needed driver not being linked directly to the kernel.

I followed your advice and found that, after the

mounting /dev/sda as /lib failed

error message, I get

sda: unknown partition table
attached scsi removable device sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0

So apparently /dev/sda is seen by the kernel, but its partition table isn't 
understood by the 2.6 kernel? I have a 2.4.31 kernel on the same USB key 
which boots fine from it.

Has anyone experienced a similar problem? Do you know what might be causing 
this? FYI,

Why shouldn't the key's partition table be recognized by this kernel?

Thanks for any help

Underlined "after" part is the relevant information here. Kernel's USB code
can be slow to detect USB devices. Of course mount fails if mounting is
attempted _before_ the device is detected.

Solution: Set INITIALDELAY=8 or other larger value in your build-initrd.sh
configuration. Extra wait time before mount won't harm 2.4 kernel boot.

&gt; So apparently /dev/sda is seen by the kernel, but its partition table isn't
&gt; understood by the 2.6 kernel? I have a 2.4.31 kernel on the same USB key
&gt; which boots fine from it.

One more check, just to be sure: Can you verify that you have
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y in your kernel configuration?

Hi Jari,

Thanks for your help. By increasing the delay I now successfully boot using 
the 2.6 kernel. Everything works. I did notice that the

&gt; &gt; sda: unknown partition table

is still around; should I worry? Or is everything fine as long as the drive 
is successfully mounted after the delay?

&gt;One more check, just to be sure: Can you verify that you have
&gt;CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y in your kernel configuration?

Yep, that is set:

[root@computer linux-2.6.14]$ grep MSDOS_PARTITION .config
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y

Again thanks,

Marv

I don't think so.  
You would need to modify the clients as well, so that every client
encrypts each connection with a different key, depending on the real
destination.  As far as I know, you cannot patch Windows XP :-)

The gateway overhead you are experiencing right now is the only way to
avoid the 30^2 tunnels you mentioned--in Tunnel Mode VPN.

Why don't you look into Transport Mode VPN instead?

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; I need to modify some CRYPTOGRAPHY code in Linux Kernel to get a specific

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Each packet sent from a given client to the other get processed 4 times 
&gt; (encryption at the sender, decryption at the gateway, encryption at the 
&gt; gateway, decryption at the receiver). This is the normal behavior but it 
&gt; imposes too much processing overhead on the linux VPN gateway. The required 
&gt; behavior is that the VPN gateway just RELAYS encrypted data (ESP envelopes) 
&gt; without decrypting them. This is impossible in the current ipsec 
&gt; implementation since"the end of a tunnel HAS ALWAYS to be decrypted".

Umm, if I understand correctly, unless each tunnel is using the same
keys, the decrypt and reencrypt ends up with *different* data. So
just skipping the decrypt won't work, you'll just end up sending
packets which the other end can't read.

If your using the same keys, perhaps the kernal can see that, I don't
know...

Hope this helps,

Hi!

For those interested in encrypting root / entire harddisk:
Sandisk TransFlash Cards (thumbnailsize) in combination with a generic USB
SD-cardreader are bootable. 
The cardreader I used for testing looks like an USB memory-stick and has
only one slot for SD cards. So the 32MB TransFlash needs its SD adapter
card. As a whole, this combo boots like from USB memory stick. You just have
to keep the tiny Transflash card in your pocket to keep thieves off your
data. Moreover, data on Transflash cards can safely be erased with a
lighter. Quick &amp; entirely.

oops, just some simple rtfm - sorry about that.
Perhaps, it is unlikely, that loop-aes contains other ciphers than aes - 
however, shame on me and big thanks to you for writing great programs.

Pourquoi disparaît-on ?
A quoi tout cela sert-il ?
Les événements de notre vie ne sont-ils pas que la partie visible d'un 
gigantesque iceberg ?
Qu'y a-t-il derrière tout cela ?

Vient un jour où la Réponse aux "Pourquoi" et aux "Comment" des choses 
devient si importante pour l'être que son attention se détourne de 
l'extérieur pour se reporter sur une réflexion méditative.

Le cycle "Combats dans l'invisible" retrace l'aventure intérieure d'un 
être ordinaire qui a enfin compris qu'il doit être, pour lui-même, un 
merveilleux sujet d'étude.

Il rentre alors dans son royaume intérieur pour en prendre peu à peu 
possession, entreprenant ainsi une épopée privée, secrète, cachée, qui 
le conduira au-delà de tout ce qu'il pensait possible.

Il devient, pour lui-même, un Roi Nomade, puis un Roi Couronné, enfin 
une sphère radiante.

Ce cheminement, présenté sous la forme d'un conte, est particulièrement 
vivant et accessible : le lecteur progresse, en compagnie du héros,

Hello.
I'm pleased to announce new release of asynchronous crypto layer for
linux kernel 2.6.
Small changelog:

* Removed crypto load balancer thread.
* Eliminated main_crypto_dev.
* Removed unused session states.
* Simplified locking and reference counting.
* Simplified load balancing schema.
* Simple load balancer is part of acrypto module now.
* Added direct completion mode. If session's
  callback can be invoked in any context or
  if crypto provider can call   complete_session() from process context,
  one can set SESSION_DIRECT in session flags which will lead to callback
  invocation directly from  complete_session(), but not from workqueue.

* Here are dm-crypt port changes:
	o Reduced memory usage.
	o Use memory pools.
	o Removed several race conditions.
	o Code simplification.

More info can be found at the project's homepage:

Tarball and patches against the latest tree can be found in archive:

The good folks at http://truecrypt.org have released version 4 of
Truecrypt (encrypted volumes) which now supports Linux, via device-mapper
and a kernel module (open-source, of course). I had previously used their
version 3.1a on win2k with good results.

On my dell laptop, I run windoz and Debian Linux (sarge), and it has
always bugged me that I didn't have an encrypted volume that I could mount
from either system.

Well, now I do!! I created a truecrypt volume that I can mount from both
Linux and Windows. The volume is formatted FAT and is stored in a file on
a FAT partition. I used FAT because I don't completely trust NTFS support
on linux yet. I had to compile the Linux binaries myself, but it was not
to difficult (I already had the kernel source installed).

Cheers,
 - Greg

Since you seem to be mounting partitionless device /dev/sda, that device
does not have valid partition table. IOW, nothing to worry about.

&gt; Or is everything fine as long as the drive is successfully mounted after
&gt; the delay?

Yes.

Many popular linux file systems meet those requirements. Uuencoded exploit

Hello,  
  
According to loop-AES.README section 2.2:  
"Don't use a journaling file system on top of file backed loop device. [snip] With file backed  
loop devices, correct write ordering may extend only to page cache (which resides in RAM) of  
underlying file system. VM can write such pages to disk in any order it wishes, and thus break  
write order expectation of journaling file system."  
  
What if I use the ReiserFS file system with the 2.6 kernel and the "nolog" mount option to disable  
journaling as described at:  
http://www.namesys.com/mount-options.html  
  
Could I then use ReiserFS on top of a file backed loop device?  
  
Thanks,  
Anon

Hello,

I recently wondered if multiple encryption can decrease the security of 
encrypted information.
Imho we can basically think of two different scenarios:
1st. Encrypting information twice.
For instance: An RSA encrypted mail is stored on a loop-aes encrypted 
harddrive. (If you think of XOR, you run into serious problems, if using same 
keys, but I guess RSA and AES won't be a problem at all.)

2nd. Encrypting information more times.
For instance: Backups are done on removeable media. Each one is encrypted with 
a different set of keys for loop-aes, but also containing very similar data.

Do you know, serious studies or trust-/helpful reports,  etc. on what 
algorithmens / implementations can / should / mustn't be combined and how 
multiple encryption effects security?

Thanks in advance.
Keep smiling

I am not an encryption expert but from what I have read multiple
encryptions of data are possible, and there are two ways to look at it.

&gt;From an theory/encryption standpoint there is nothing wrong with
encrypting one thing in another, ie an AES-encrypted zip on a loop-aes'd
drive because the file is recognized as a file by the filesystem and
block driver, (I have AES-encrypted zips on a loop-aes'd drive), so in
that respect it would work.  I've heard that a problem might arise that
if a skilled cryto-attacker looks at it, (s)he can sometimes look at
patterns of one encryption "layer" to infer things about the other
"layer", meaning there could be patterns found on one layer in the
cipher text that make the key of the other layer more predictable, which
makes the overall data structure more vulnerable - but again I am not a
crypto-expert.

&gt;From a practical/implementation standpoint, I know of no product or
program that attempts this.  Putting encrypted files on a loop-aes drive
does not count as "the same thing twice", because they are at different
"system layers" (roughly OSI model).  The best way to secure data is to
make sure the cipher and program you use are well tested by trusted and
competent people.  In general encryption is hard enough to get working,
and if done right, even harder to break - "double-encryption" would
probably only make it harder to get working, and possibly easier to break.

With that said, does anyone know of anything that will do double encryption?

i don't know the name of the papers.. but here you can find everything :-)

http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/

there are some criterias for ciphers by design which answer your querstion:

- the cipher output should be random, so there is no way to guess the cipher
	itself, nor the original content

- none of the content should act as a "neutral" element, think of numbers
	where a multiply with 1 results in the orig. number, this clearly should
	not happen.

- your question mixes ciphers and implemenations, some ciphers have their
	weak spots, but normally "clever" implementations cover them. So do not
	try to build your own encryption system, the results normally are fatal
	unuseable.

This is rather logical.
Considering this, I don't understand how / why does gnupg know what cipher is 
used (aes, twofish, etc.) if I try to decrypt symmetric encrypted data (at 
least)?

everything needed to decrypt the content is added to the message (ciphers, 
content encoding,...), the only thing additional needed is the 
"passphrase/key".

I once read a usenet thread discussing this issue - Bruce Schneider posted and said \
that multiple encryption with the same algorithm could actually weaken the encryption \
if there was a defect in that algorithm.  He gave an explanation which I can't \
recall.   
 I do recall that the conclusion of the posters in the thread seemed to be that, if \
using multiple encryption, it is best to use two different algorithms from two \
different sources to avoid the abovementioned multiplicative effect of a defect in \
either one of the algorithms.  
 You can probably find this thread on google groups if you search for Bruce \

&lt;div id="RTEContent"&gt; I once read a usenet thread discussing this issue - Bruce \
Schneider posted and said that multiple encryption with the same algorithm could \
actually weaken the encryption if there was a defect in that algorithm.  He gave \
an explanation which I can't recall. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I do recall that the conclusion of the \
posters in the thread seemed to be that, if using multiple encryption, it is best to \
use two different algorithms from two different sources to avoid the abovementioned \
multiplicative effect of a defect in either one of the algorithms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can \

well, at least in "Applied Cryptography" he's saying that 
double/multiple encryption is a way to *increase* security:

http://friedo.szm.sk/krypto/AC/ch15/15-01.html

so, i if a message is encrypted with different algorithms, each one has 
to be broken (a "defect" has to be found).

if it's encrypted with the same algo and a defect is found, i'd say 
encryption was not weakened by the (double-) encryption but only the 
level of "feeling secure, because i double encrypted" has fallen more 
rapidly as expected.

*if* multiple encryption would actually weaken an algotithm, then we'd 
have found new attacks...

doing multiple encryption with the same algo is a bad idea, and it
somehow escapes my personal view of common sense why one would do
that. Phil referred to this example, you referred to the way one can
safely assume one would usually do. f.e. first aes, then serpent, or
whatever, or the other way round; whatever comes first ;-)


&gt; *if* multiple encryption would actually weaken an algotithm, then
&gt; *we'd have found new attacks...

i guess we walk a fine line there. i agree to your statement, but an
algo's weakness may offer a faster route to breaking the cypher if a
certain scenario is met, like doing multi enc using the same algo.
speculation on my part, not much else left i think.


i faintly remember that one of these two algos, twofish or blowfish,
is not to be used for large amounts of data, like 200 GB or so. i
don't recall the speficics, only remember that there was some kind of
catch to it. any info on this would be greatly appreciated.

ack again, different algos -&gt; common sense. in fact, i only know of

case.

Hello all,   
   
This question is for Jari.   
   
In the loop-AES.README file, in section 7.2. Example 2 is the following instruction that makes a   
uuencoded key file that gets piped through gpg (on the second line of this command):   
head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65   
   
This key file has 45 bytes of uuencoded random data per line.  How does loop-AES use the data on  
each line?:   
1) does loop-AES use the data as read from the key file, thereby limiting AES disk keys to only  
printable characters instead of the full possible values from 0 to 255 per byte, or   
2) does loop-AES uudecode the data thereby using the original, raw randomly generated data, or   
3) some other way (please describe)  
  
I ask because I would like to know if the range of possible values per AES disk key is  
artificially reduced by the uuencoding process, and the possibility of introducing a weakness into  
the encryption system through the patterned process of uuencoding.  
  
Also, if loop-AES uses method number 2 above, then each line contains 360 bits of random data.   
So, does loop-AES discard the "excess" bits it does not use?  For example, if 256 bit AES is used,  
does loop-AES discard 104 bits of data from each line of the key file? 
 
Could loop-AES use a key file that contains binary or hex data instead of the uuencoded data? 
  
Thank you in advance,  
Anon

Hi!

Just today I saw "test disk" from http://www.cgsecurity.org/ while being at
work.
I didn´t run it at home on my own disc but my question might be a serious
concern.
As "test disk" is able to restore overwritten/shredded (dev/urandom) or
erased (dev/zero) partitions, how secure is encrypted root as aespipe reads
data from one partition, pipes it through aes and writes it back to the same
partition?
In case you can restore a shredded partition with such a tool, what can you
do with data encrypted by aespipe???
This has nothing to do with watermark or code attacks. It´s just the fear
that someone could recover all data in a state *before* it was piped through
aespipe.
Is this a real problem or just neglectable?

Regards,
Peter

well, data recovery/shredding has been discussed *very* often on various 
lists, in the end the best thing you can do is to shred the 
storage-medium itsself (and eat it afterwards ;-))

but you're asking:

&gt; In case you can restore a shredded partition with such a tool, what can you
&gt; do with data encrypted by aespipe???

well, *hopefully nothing* nothing can be done with AES-encrypted data 
(if you're not in posession of the key of course). that's the point of 
encryption, right?

&gt; This has nothing to do with watermark or code attacks. It´s just the fear
&gt; that someone could recover all data in a state *before* it was piped through
&gt; aespipe.

yes, the leftover plaintext has to be overwritten of course. but as said 
before: to besure, just (aes)pipe the encrypted data to a fresh disk, 
then destroy the disk with the plaintext...

&gt; Is this a real problem or just neglectable?

as always: "it depends". think of the expense to
  - just wipe the plaintext partition
  - destroy the disk
  - eat the disk-shreds ;-)
  - spot the parking car next to your lab with the TEMPEST device on
    board to get the passphrase from your keyboard

and if it's worth the data you're going to secure.

You read the description wrong.

It can't do what you wrote. Any SOFTWARE can only read what the harddrive
deliveres.

When you have overriden a sector there is NO WAY for SOFTWARE to get the
old contents(*).

If you have overriden it, it's overriden POINT.

You need MUCH MUCH money to get old contents and specialized HARDWARE.

Uploading new customized DSP firmware to the disk controller may be able to
recover earlier sector data. Data recovery companies doing that probably
have to sign very restrictive non-disclosure agreements to get firmware
sources from disk manufacturers. Distributing such sources under GPL... no
chance.

That's what i interpreted into (or out of) the original question.

Especially the "overwritten/shredded"-keyword let me jump to that 
conclusion. But i have to confess that i only did a quick scan of the 
referred page, i hadn't read it.

That's one of the cases i was refering to with the star.

Another would be e.g. a relocated "bad" sector where you had to have a 
patched firmware to get the contents of the original sector. Assuming 
there is/are (a) bad sector(s) and that they are readable at all.

For Joe User it is just out of leage.

So let's just say:
As long as you don't have enemies with large enough amounts of money to 
spare, the stored data beeing very valuable or you beeing a criminal you 
shouldn't be worried too much. :-)

It would make little sense to send your hard disk data into and out of a usb
port to speed up loop-aes... I was researching this topic (i.e. AES encryption
via hardware, incidently on *BSD) and came across these cards:

http://www.interfacemasters.com/products/index.html

(See the e-commerce processor boards)

Anyone used these or cards with the Broadcom BCM5823-200? Such as:

Some more are listed here:

I tried the Soekris card on FreeBSD; both OpenBSD and FreeBSD use a  
kernel-level cryptographic framework that can use these PCI hardware  
accelerators (hifn chips).

They are not appropriate for on-disk encryption.

I don't have the details correct, but it is a performance issue: data  
must transferred from main memory via the CPU to the PCI card for  
processing, and then the data is transferred back, and then it is  
written to disk.

The accelerator cards are more appropriate for network packet  
encryption: the network stack could tell a network interface to  
perform direct memory transfer to the crypto card on the PCI bus  
before ever hitting the CPU or the main memory. In that application,  
one could achieve "wire-speed" encryption of the network packets,  
without CPU overhead.

My experience is that for disk I/O, crypto operations of the CPU are  
still faster than the PCI-based crytpo accelerators.

This almost certainly does NOT apply to the VIA "padlock" crypto  
acceleration, which adds instructions to the x86 ABI and performs  
crypto operations on the CPU.

{Open, Free}BSD is a fun system to use if one is concerned about  
security and robustness. But I have not found a disk-encryption  
solution that rivals loop-aes on Linux for performance and stability.

&gt; I tried the Soekris card on FreeBSD; both OpenBSD and FreeBSD use a

&gt;
&gt; They are not appropriate for on-disk encryption.
&gt;
&gt; I don't have the details correct, but it is a performance issue: data
&gt; must transferred from main memory via the CPU to the PCI card for
&gt; processing, and then the data is transferred back, and then it is
&gt; written to disk.

USB 2.0 has 400Mbit (50 Mbyte) per sec. HD has ~ 20MB. If you just encrypt i/o 
-data, this shouldn't be an issue.

&gt; The accelerator cards are more appropriate for network packet
&gt; encryption: the network stack could tell a network interface to
&gt; perform direct memory transfer to the crypto card on the PCI bus
&gt; before ever hitting the CPU or the main memory. In that application,
&gt; one could achieve "wire-speed" encryption of the network packets,
&gt; without CPU overhead.
&gt;
&gt; My experience is that for disk I/O, crypto operations of the CPU are
&gt; still faster than the PCI-based crytpo accelerators.

Ok..

&gt; This almost certainly does NOT apply to the VIA "padlock" crypto
&gt; acceleration, which adds instructions to the x86 ABI and performs
&gt; crypto operations on the CPU.

&gt; {Open, Free}BSD is a fun system to use if one is concerned about
&gt; security and robustness. But I have not found a disk-encryption
&gt; solution that rivals loop-aes on Linux for performance and stability.

Ok.

Theoretically, hi-speed USB2 is 480Mbit.

I would expect a hard disk to be faster than 20MB/sec, but I don't know if
it would reach 60MB/sec.

I used a loop-twofish for a long time.

The concern about encrypting hundreds of gigabytes WITH THE SAME KEY  
is real.

Right now, loop-aes can use up to 65 keys on the data. The largest  
disks I own are 400 GB, which should have about the same risk -- when  
they are completely full -- of encrypting 6 GB of data with the same  
key.

I am not much concerned.

What is far more difficult is getting the overall crypto-system  
implementation correct. That is where the debates occur. I choose to  
use loop-aes these days.

&gt; Hello,  
&gt;   
&gt; According to loop-AES.README section 2.2:  
&gt; "Don't use a journaling file system on top of file backed loop device. [snip] With file backed  
&gt; loop devices, correct write ordering may extend only to page cache (which resides in RAM) of  
&gt; underlying file system. VM can write such pages to disk in any order it wishes, and thus break  
&gt; write order expectation of journaling file system."  
&gt;   
&gt; What if I use the ReiserFS file system with the 2.6 kernel and the "nolog" mount option to disable  
&gt; journaling as described at:  
&gt; http://www.namesys.com/mount-options.html  
&gt;   
&gt; Could I then use ReiserFS on top of a file backed loop device?  

AFAIK/AFAICT this is a "should not" thing.

You can use a journaling file-system-loopdevice on a journaling-files-system.
I personally use a XFS-filesystem-in-loop on a reiserfs-partition because
an XFS-filesystem can be easily grown. (unmount/losetup -d, grow the file,
losetup/mount, xfs_growfs &lt;mountpoint&gt;, you are done. This way the
loop-file stays the smallest possible size)

BUT in case your computer breaks down while writing data the probability of
a damaged filesystem increases enourmously as the blocks of the data and
journal of the filesystem in the loop could be written to the disc-platter
in any order. So the directorys (changed at the time of breakdown) and/or
(especially) the journal (can be damaged/are plain garbage) with a much
higher probability after a breakdown.

IOW you practicaly "loose" the journaling feature (and this is exactly for
the "error"-case. Most of the time the journal is "useless" as it's only
use is for correcting errors after any kind of "mishap") and you SHOULD use
a filesystem with a good fsck-tool.

But appart from that i don't think there are any other problems.
I remember some rants about possibel deadlocks if you stack
journaling-filesystems and block-layers, but i say that a deadlocking
filesystem is simply buggy.

As long as you only read (with noatime) while breaking down or there aren't
any dirty-buffers (and nothing unprocessed in the log) while breaking
down,the filesystem shouldn't get any more damaged by a breakdown than any
other filesystem directly on a block-device.

So as long as your computer doesn't break down you shouldn't have any
problems at all. :-)

the loop-AES.README also states:

    File backed loops may deadlock under some kernel + file system
    combinations.
    So, if you can choose between device backed and file backed, choose
    device backed even if it means that you have to re-partition your

so, file backed loops SHOULD be avoided, no matter if encrypted or not, 
with journaling fs on it or without. yes, it's possible and you SHOULD 
try it to see if it works for you. but in "most cases" file backed loops 
are behaving better.

You pack an encryption layer onto the partion/device.
"losetup" it and losetup the next layer directly onto the newly created 
/dev/loop&lt;x&gt; device.

That way you only stack block-devices and pack a filesystem on the last one.

For a (say) 4 layer encryption you would stack;

HDD -&gt; Partition
-&gt; Loop 1 -&gt; Loop 2 -&gt; Loop 3 -&gt; Loop 4
-&gt; Filesystem

e.g.
sdb -&gt; sdb1 -&gt; loop0 -&gt; loop1 -&gt; loop2 -&gt; loop3 -&gt; &lt;whatever&gt;

If you want you can also pack the encryption keys before each layer 
using the "offset"-options to leave the needed space for the keys and 
shrink the block-device of each layer by a little bit.

That way you had to actually break each encryption layer to even get the 
needed keys for the next. (Of course the key-sets are also encrypted 
with by gpg or whatever else layer you may think of)

Thank you for the suggestion.  I just read a similar suggestion for Jari, though I need a more 
detailed example to actually implement the suggestion (as in an example fstab and command line 
that properly sets up the stack of loops).  I never stacked loops before, and do not yet seem to 
understand how I would stack loops. 
 
While your suggestion with the keys residing in each layer may be convenient, I think it 
needlessly reduces the security to Level 2 as stated in the loop-AES.README.  It would be just as 
convenient and easy to store the keys external to the encrypted partion/loops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Could I then use ReiserFS on top of a file backed loop device?    
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the loop-AES.README also states:  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   1. Loop device primer  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   [...]  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   File backed loops may deadlock under some kernel + file system  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   combinations.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   So, if you can choose between device backed and file backed, choose  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   device backed even if it means that you have to re-partition your  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   disks.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;I *am* planning on using a device-backed loop.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so, file backed loops SHOULD be avoided, no matter if encrypted or not,   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with journaling fs on it or without. yes, it's possible and you SHOULD   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;try it to see if it works for you. but in "most cases" file backed loops   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are behaving better.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;I assume you really meant device-backed loops in the last sentance above.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;&gt;My interest in using a file-backed loop is so that I can have a loop-AES device-backed loop  
&gt;&gt;&gt;containing a loop-AES file-backed loop, for two (or more) layers of encryption.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have the impression from the loop-AES.README file a non-journalling file system can be used 
&gt; 
&gt; in a  
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;file-backed loop.  It is my understanding from the ReiserFS documentation that using the 
&gt; 
&gt; "nolog"  
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;option during mounting would satisfy the non-journalling criteria, as this option disables  
&gt;&gt;&gt;journalling.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;For that scenario you only 'need' a filesystem for the last layer. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;You pack an encryption layer onto the partion/device. 
&gt;&gt;"losetup" it and losetup the next layer directly onto the newly created  
&gt;&gt;/dev/loop&lt;x&gt; device. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;That way you only stack block-devices and pack a filesystem on the last one. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;For a (say) 4 layer encryption you would stack; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;HDD -&gt; Partition 
&gt;&gt;-&gt; Loop 1 -&gt; Loop 2 -&gt; Loop 3 -&gt; Loop 4 
&gt;&gt;-&gt; Filesystem 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;e.g. 
&gt;&gt;sdb -&gt; sdb1 -&gt; loop0 -&gt; loop1 -&gt; loop2 -&gt; loop3 -&gt; &lt;whatever&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;If you want you can also pack the encryption keys before each layer  
&gt;&gt;using the "offset"-options to leave the needed space for the keys and  
&gt;&gt;shrink the block-device of each layer by a little bit. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;That way you had to actually break each encryption layer to even get the  
&gt;&gt;needed keys for the next. (Of course the key-sets are also encrypted  
&gt;&gt;with by gpg or whatever else layer you may think of) 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the suggestion.  I just read a similar suggestion for Jari, though I need a more 
&gt; detailed example to actually implement the suggestion (as in an example fstab and command line 
&gt; that properly sets up the stack of loops).  I never stacked loops before, and do not yet seem to 
&gt; understand how I would stack loops. 
&gt;  
&gt; While your suggestion with the keys residing in each layer may be convenient, I think it 
&gt; needlessly reduces the security to Level 2 as stated in the loop-AES.README.  It would be just as 
&gt; convenient and easy to store the keys external to the encrypted partion/loops. 

Taken the losetup from the README i've just written this shell-script
Example is for 4 layer, but you can be easily changed for more or less.

                        print "No more loop devices /dev/loop${loop}"
                        exit 99

        done
        echo "/dev/loop${loop}"
        let loop=loop+1
        exit $loop

If you have other loop-devices the used loop-devices may not be persistent.

But you could also change the script to use fixed-numbers instead.

Thank you for the script.  I wish I knew bash so I could understand the script better. 
 
While I do very much appreciate your effort, I hoped to get something *much* more simple and 
direct to help me understand the process of stacking just *two* loops, so I can understand how it 
works. 
 
What I *really* need is an example of stacking two loops, shown as the needed fstab entries and 
then the command line commands to set up the stack of loops.

I guess you really need experience with it :-) How hard can it be?
Follow the example in the README. After that is successfully set up,
follow it again and adapt it accordingly (just replace /dev/hda666
with the already set up /dev/loop#, use next free /dev/loop# of
course)

I stick with what I wrote. Sooner or later you _will_ need the
experience, like we all do. What I meant, in detail, is that it's not
done with setup, one needs to know about possible "emergency
situations" as well. What do you do if something goes wrong?
Filesystem needs checkup / won't mount? Things like that need to be
tested, better sooner than later. To cope with such a situation one
needs to understand the whole process first. Asking a mailing list is
not always possible; at the very least it delays system operations.
So, better have some experience / documented it yourself (e.g. have
written some usable [understandable] scripts).

I myself try to play with such things first, get them to work on my
own. If it doesn't work, there's always the mailing list ('s
archives). What I said doesn't contradict what you wrote, it's just a
different approach. Don't feel insulted, I surely didn't mean it.

After all, experience never hurts; one never can know too much :-)

Well, this is something I asked for about a year ago, multiple encryption.
You could think of it as either done in a) several layers or b) interleaved.
a) means the whole partition/container gets encrypted in aes, then again in
blowfish, then again in twofish,........
b) means the wohle parition/container is split up in 512byte blocks  with
first block encrypted in aes, second in blowfish, thrid in twofish,....till
you start this cycle of algos again with some block

a) is more secure but slower depending on number of layers
b) might have problems with truncation or cycling of the algos
both versions will consume more memory in the cpu, lead to a bigger loop.ko
I can´t tell if it´s worth to do something like this. The key-setup gets
rather complex....

Peter

&gt; What is the reason the MD5 hash was chosen over other hashes for computing  
&gt; the IV (Initialization Vector); in particular, SHA256 or SHA512?  
   
128 bit block size ciphers need 128 bit IV. MD5 output is 128 bits. Speed  
was also important.  
   
If you are worrying about security... The way MD5 is used in loop-AES is not  
vulnerable. Recent MD5 attacks need known state. Adversary does not have  
known state, nether before nor after adversary supplied data is processed.  
Loop-AES version 3 on-disk format uses 65th key (unknown to adversary) as  
MD5 input before adversary supplied data, and output end up being encrypted  
using AES (again, with a key unknown to adversary).

&gt; Hello all,   
&gt;    
&gt; This question is for Jari.   
&gt;    
&gt; In the loop-AES.README file, in section 7.2. Example 2 is the following instruction that makes a   
&gt; uuencoded key file that gets piped through gpg (on the second line of this command):   
&gt; head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65   
&gt;    
&gt; This key file has 45 bytes of uuencoded random data per line.  How does loop-AES use the data on  
&gt; each line?:   
&gt; 1) does loop-AES use the data as read from the key file, thereby limiting AES disk keys to only  
&gt; printable characters instead of the full possible values from 0 to 255 per byte, or   
&gt; 2) does loop-AES uudecode the data thereby using the original, raw randomly generated data, or   
&gt; 3) some other way (please describe)  

3)
The "keys" are not used directly. In normal setups they are hashed into a
binary-value as needed for the used cipher before use.
e.g. 128bits for AES128.

As you correctly say below the "entropy" of the 45*8=360 bits isn't reduced
by representing them as base64-coded data.
The hashed-value is different because of the "fill"-bits, but the strength
of the algorithm stays the same.

&gt; I ask because I would like to know if the range of possible values per AES disk key is  
&gt; artificially reduced by the uuencoding process, and the possibility of introducing a weakness into  
&gt; the encryption system through the patterned process of uuencoding.  
&gt;   
&gt; Also, if loop-AES uses method number 2 above, then each line contains 360 bits of random data.   
&gt; So, does loop-AES discard the "excess" bits it does not use?  For example, if 256 bit AES is used,  
&gt; does loop-AES discard 104 bits of data from each line of the key file? 
&gt;  
&gt; Could loop-AES use a key file that contains binary or hex data instead of the uuencoded data?

&gt; As "test disk" is able to restore overwritten/shredded (dev/urandom) or
&gt; erased (dev/zero) partitions,

The documentation doesn't say it can do that.  It just says it can
find where they start (and/or end) when that information (which is
usually in the MBR) has been lost.  This is easy as most filesystems
have signatures ("magic numbers") which can be identified, and/or they
tend to be at certain places on the disk (for example, cylinder
boundaries).  Overwriting an entry in your partition table is much
different than overwriting the partition itself.

So far, as Simson Garfinkel has pointed out, nobody has shown any
evidence that you can recover data after just one overwrite with
zeroes.  Then again absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.=20
Lacking any evidence one way or the other, I assume it is possible in
my risk analyses, since that way I don't get any nasty surprises.

Those obsolete options have meaning only in single-key mode. They are there

gpg does good salted+iterated key setup. Changed private keyring passphrase,

do even more iteration for better resistance against dictionary attacks.

In other words, you don't need above PSEED= and ITERCOUNTK= options.

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, danger is in ordering of writes:
&gt; 1) log intent of doing something dangerous
&gt; 2) do dangerous operation
&gt; 3) log dangerous operation completed
&gt; 
&gt; Write #2 or #3 must not hit disk platters before write #1, and
&gt; write #3 must
&gt; not hit disk platters before write #2. If power is lost, journal
&gt; replay on
&gt; next mount is able to fix partially completed operation.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with enabled disk write cache is that the disk may say
&gt; "write
&gt; complete" to kernel driver before the data hits disk platters, and
&gt; after
&gt; that disk may re-order multiple pending writes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wouldn't that be a general problem with any journalised
&gt; filesystem?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If so, as most OS'es nowadays have journalised filesystems, does
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; modern harddisks have ways to prevent such problems, or does the
&gt; harddisk
&gt; &gt; (filesystem?) driver implement some 'sync'-function before
&gt; commiting the
&gt; &gt; journal?
&gt; 
&gt; To get write ordering right, kernel driver must issue cache flush
&gt; command to
&gt; the disk, or in case where cache flush command is not available,
&gt; cache
&gt; disable + cache enable command sequence may also flush pending
&gt; writes.
&gt;  
&gt; That is what block I/O write barriers do. 2.6 kernels now support
&gt; them on
&gt; some block devices. Device backed loop-AES driver maintains correct
&gt; write
&gt; order and supports write barriers if underlying device supports
&gt; write
&gt; barriers. Mainline loop driver supports neither barriers nor
&gt; correct
&gt; ordering of writes.
&gt; 

So baseline, must I prepare my kernel (use 2.6, select some option or
whatever) to use ext3 safely, encrypted or not? Does ext3/loop-aes
encryption increase risks compared to ext3/plain? If loop-aes
maintains write-order, then I suppose ext3/loop-aes and ext3/plain
have same risks.


&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should clarify the question, I was thinking on
&gt; journalising
&gt; &gt; filesystems (ext3) on nonencrypted drives as well, eg. shouldn't
&gt; &gt; _any_ ext3-user, also someone not using encryption, disable
&gt; &gt; write-cache? Or is this case different because you have:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ext3
&gt; &gt;   |
&gt; &gt;   v
&gt; &gt; loop
&gt; &gt;   |
&gt; &gt;   v
&gt; &gt; physical driver, /dev/hda
&gt; 
&gt; Same write cache problems and solutions apply to both device backed
&gt; loop-AES
&gt; and to ext3 file system directly on partition. Journaling file
&gt; system on
&gt; file backed loop is FUBAR on both mainline and loop-AES versions.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the end it comes down to finding the risk of just using
&gt; &gt; write-cache anyway, with loop-aes and ext3, I mean, ext3 &amp;
&gt; &gt; write-cache disk are probably what most people use today, and it
&gt; &gt; seems to me even in the write-cache enabled case, ext3 loses far
&gt; less
&gt; &gt; data than ext2.
&gt; 
&gt; If a box has any data that is worth something, it probably has an
&gt; UPS. On
&gt; UPS powered boxes, it is best to leave disk write caches enabled.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On another topic: shouldn't the KEYSCRUB option be enabled by
&gt; default?
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe. Performance cost is less than 1%. Keyscrub version needs to
&gt; allocate
&gt; about twice the amount of RAM to hold expanded encryption keys: 40
&gt; KB for
&gt; normal multi-key for each initialized device, 76 KB for keyscrub
&gt; version.
&gt; Not everyone likes that.
&gt; 

KEYSCRUB=n could still be available for aficionados. However, I'd
really like to see someone recovering the key from 'wornout
ram-oxide'.

Hi


I'm trying to get aespipe to automatic "decrypting" a "--stored" gpgkey 
without asking for the nonexisting password. And/Or how i can do this 
automatically when the gpgkey actually has a password. And/Or providing 
a "plain-text" key existing as a file or not.

It's not as easy as it is with e.g. "mount" or "losetup" because with 
aespipe "stdin" is blocked and aespipe doesn't seam to provide a means 
to NOT use stdin for providing the data to en-/decrypt.

For the "--store"-gpgkey-case i've helped myself with using an dummy 
"-p3" option to specify a nonexisting filehandle.
This actually works, but i don't think this is what i would call a 
"clean" solution, i'd call it a workaround.

And it not usable when the key is encrypted or if i wanted to pipe a 
plain-text key to aespipe.

Is there a way, other than writing a helper-program or patching aespipe 
to accept a "--file"-parameter, to get the data (to en- or decrypt) and 
the key over to aespipe?

aespipe -p3 -d &lt; &lt;data&gt; 3&lt; &lt;key&gt;
didn't seam to work for me. :-(

Hi all, I'm sorry in advance for my bad english.
I've a problem to build a kernel with loopAES support. This is my 
procedure (following the readme file):

I've compiled a 2.6.12 kernel with

CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_KMOD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=N

and then I lunch make;

cd /usr/src/
wget http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/loop-AES-latest.tar.bz2
tar xvfj loop-AES-latest.tar.bz2
cd loop-AES-latest
make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.12 KEYSCRUB=y AMD64_ASM=n

cd /usr/src/
wget 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.12r.tar.bz2
bzip2 -d -c util-linux-2.12r.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd util-linux-2.12r
patch -p1 &lt;/usr/src/loop-AES-v3.1b/util-linux-2.12r.diff
CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure

and here I've this output

I've already util-linux installed and if I try to remove the actual 
installation with `apt-get remove util-linux` (I'm on debian) other 
packages are kept back for remove:

base-config console-common console-data console-tools initrd-tools 
initscripts modutils sysvinit util-linux

Can anyone help me? Thanks very much.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

After reading a lot I found out that there are still known weaknesses
in loop-aes, although multi-v3-key mode should reduce the risk of some
of these.

Refering to http://clemens.endorphin.org/nmihde/nmihde-A4-os.pdf,
there seem to be remarkable attack possibilities because of the
weaknesses of CBC scheme in general. (see chapter 4 of the PDF)


Are you planing to change loop-aes implementation to support also this
new LRW patch or something that prevents these kind of attacks?
Personally, I'd prefer if I could use this software because I think
the developers know more about the stuff than some other people.. The
best thing though would be if you develop together with the
luks/dm-crypt people and create something even better than both of you
could develop alone :)

Hope to get a reply soon :)

Something is really wrong with your installed compiler or libraries or you
have some strange environment variables set that affect parameters passed to
compiler or linker. 

Can you post output of 'env' and 'cat make_include' commands?

This is what 'CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure' says here on debian Sarge:

I believe util-linux package is required for normal operation and removing

binaries with newer versions works just fine.

So, can I replace the singles patched executables (mount, umount, 
losetup, swapon, swapoff)?
Thanks very much for the replay!

Hi all, I've a question for you.
This is how I encrypt a file:

head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65 \
        | gpg --symmetric -a &gt;/tmp/keyfile.gpg


dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/file.img bs=1M count=10


head -c 15 /dev/urandom | uuencode -m - | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 \
        | losetup -e AES256 -K /tmp/keyfile.gpg /dev/loop1 /tmp/file.img


mkfs.ext2 /dev/loop1

mount /dev/loop1 /mnt/crypt

(This is my complete procedure, please check it out :) )


I want to use two different keys for encryption the single file, but one 
key must be have a time-limit validity.
Is it possibile?
Thanks in advance for the help.

Hello everyone,

I have often heard arguments against only encrypting the partition(s) 
containing sensitive data: "data will leak", people tell me, hence you 
should really be encrypting the entire system.

I would like to know how exactly it is that "data leaks". Swap is an obvious 
suspect; but suppose you just use a chunk of RAM as a swap device 
[http://kerneltrap.org/node/3660]. Similarly, /tmp is mounted as a ramfs. 
Given such a setup, is there any reason to fear data leakage to sectors 
outside the encrypted partition?

Thanks for any hints,

Marvin

Hi all,

I have successfully followed all the steps in the loop-AES readme file. 
Since I couldn't find any reference to this, I would like to know whether 
the step in which one creates the 65 random keys

head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65 \
| gpg --symmetric -a &gt;/a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg

needs any modification for use in AES256 mode. Or is it enough to replace 
all occurrences of AES128 with AES256 as one follows the README file?

Thanks for any help

Marv

Hello everyone,

I finally got a few hours to setup a loop-AES encrypted root partition on my 
machine. I religiously followed the readme and on the second attempt it 
worked: I successfully booted from a usb-drive into the encrypted root 
partition.

However, something obviously went wrong when I subsequently recompiled the 
kernel to add a driver I had forgotten to include the first time I built it. 
It is the same kernel version for which I had built the loop-aes module 
(2.4.31), but I nonetheless rebuilt the module, too. I moved the new kernel 
image and System.map files into /boot, copied the module from 
/lib/modules/2.4.31/block/loop.o into /boot/modules-2.4.31/loop.o and again 
copied all files from /boot to the usb key. Then I reran syslinux /dev/sda 
and sync'ed.

However, ever since I did this my computer hangs when booting from the key:

SYSLINUX 2.11 ...
Loading vmlinuz...
Loading initrd.gz...
Ready.
Uncompressing Linux... Ok,  booting the kernel.

And it hangs there (in fact, the cursor is still blinking, so I don't know 
if it is technically speaking "hanged"). Using a knoppix cd and the 
rootkey.gpg on my usb key I can successfully mount the encrypted root 
partition and use my system "as usual", so I know that the problem resides 
in the contents of the usb key.

Could anyone please give me some guidance on what to check given that it 
hangs at the "Ok,  booting the kernel" stage? My kernel config still matches 
the requirements on the readme. What might be going wrong?

In the meantime I completely rebuilt the usb-key (erased all its contents 
except for the rootkey.gpg file, reran the build-initrd.sh script) and the 
problem persists.

Thanks so much for any help,

Marvin

from how the code is structured, blowfish should be default after the
compile.  just run passwd(1) so your shadow file will then be
blowfish-encrypted.  (pretty sure you don't want to try to
authenticate an MD5 password with Blowfish.)  ;-)

enjoy yourself,

Well, I decided to just go ahead and use AES128. Concluded that, as with all 
computing stuff, it is too easy to get carried away by the "let's go for the 
largest number" mentality whenever confronted with a choice and don't really 
know any of the details. : )

&gt;
&gt;that code seems to work just fine, since almost all examples on the
&gt;net use either 2925 bytes from /dev/random or 2880 bytes.  however, i
&gt;guess if you really want to be picky you can up it to 5850 bytes
&gt;(double 2925), since you are technically doubling your key sizes.
&gt;(it's a wild guess, really.)

FYI the command

head -c 2925 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 66 | tail -n 65 \
| gpg --symmetric -a &gt;/a/usbstick/keyfile.gpg

produces a key that will work with AES128, 192, 256 or other cipher you
use it with; it is independent of the cipher.  Because of the "head" and
"tail" commands being used, you could type head -c 10000000 ... and
still end up with a key of the same size.  I tried this once and any
value equal to or over 2925 will not change the size of the key, because
head and tail concatenate the output.

When I setup loop-aes I used a patched version of gpg (the patch that
came with loop-aes) as well as the --cipher-algo=AES256 option on gpg as
gpg defaults to CAST5 as the cipher.

Hi David

I understand what the head command is just doing away with the uuencode 
header while tail extracts the last 65 lines; but still, why is each key 45 
bytes in length?

I suppose that what varies from, eg, AES128 to AES192 is the length of the 
key with which the 65 (sector) keys are then encrypted; is that it? This is 
the only way in which my rudimentary understanding of these issues allows me 
to make sense of the fact that sector keys are allowed to have the same 
length in both scenarios.

Again, any clarification would be great

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; needs any modification for use in AES256 mode. Or is it enough to
&gt; &gt;&gt; replace
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all occurrences of AES128 with AES256 as one follows the README file?

/var/run

There may well be other places... check the Linux Filesystem

Honestly, I found it much more robust to simply encrypt the whole  
disk and have done with it. This worked well enough on a Linux  
laptop, I booted from a USB flash drive. (Now I use a Mac OS X laptop  
which does not yet support whole-disk encryption, so I make do as  
best I can... but on Linux there are better options!)

The article explains that. Although swap/"virtual memory" initially was

copious amounts of RAM but no swap. "Surely you are joking" was also my

Then again, apps run by a non-privileged user lack the permissions to write 
to that many places on the dir tree other than the user's home dir and the 
tmp dirs.

First of all, thanks for the info. 

However, I took a glance at the article and I don't see the problem;
the first paragraph of that article does not mention anything you
refer to:

"Linux: How to Use RAM as Swap
Posted by kmerley on Tuesday, August 17, 2004 - 23:05

Article submitted by Kim Merley

This article describes the required steps to convert a portion of RAM
into swap space. We examine some of the reasons you might want to do
this, including that using RAM as swap can be many times less
expensive than using most fast solid state storage solutions.
Additionally, it can be a lot easier to purchase and implement. Read
on for the details."

Maybe you'd like to quote the passage that concers you, regarding a
specific setup (f.e., encrypted /home &amp; swap, /tmp in ram) and why
exactly, with regard to the afforementioned setup, could it result in
data leakage? How do you define data leakage in that context?

This just strikes me as absurd beyond belief. If you have
more RAM your tasks won't swap out as much. I've on
occasion set up systems with no swap and they worked just
fine so long as the number of runnning tasks was sized
properly.

Are you talking about main memory or are you talking
about swapping to a solid state memory device that
pretends to be a disk? That at least makes some kind
of sense if it is truly fast memory.

If your system is slow, give it more RAM. Swapping
takes time, no matter what the target store and you
do not want to do it unless you have too little RAM
to start with.

Seems you are using file backed loop. Read-only mounting iso9960 images and
such work fine with file backed loops. My advise is to avoid writable file
backed loops.

&gt; I want to use two different keys for encryption the single file, but one
&gt; key must be have a time-limit validity.

If you use public key crypto and specify multiple recipients when you
encrypt the key file contents, then each recipient can use their gpg private
key passphrase to unlock the key file contents. Time limit can be enforced
by re-encrypting key file contents using different set of recipients.

Hi



&gt; Yes, this is a solution.
&gt; But my problem is to give a time-limit access at some files backed loop 
&gt; with a key file distributed to specific allowed users. This acces must 
&gt; be time-limited (from 1 to 3 week by a specific date). No public or 
&gt; private key are available, there is only the gpg/pgp installation on 
&gt; the host (yes I use this file also on other o.s.).
&gt; Is my explanation clearly? :)

I guess the/a solution to this depends on the exact circumstances (see 
below)

I'd say the easiest 90-95% solution would be to NOT store the key on the 
target system, but to get it from a server under YOUR control (so you 
can be e.g. sure the clock is correct) everytime the filesystem is mounted.

I'd say the most secure way would be using a SSH-connection, if you 
generate a key-pair for EVERY target system you have a quite good 
secured link over which to transfer the key, you wouldn't even need a 
gpg secured key. At least it doesn't need to be a gpg key while 
transfered over the SSH-link to the target system.

In the easiest setup

ssh &lt;...&gt; &lt;programm/script which outputs key&gt; | mount -p0 ...

It would be quite secure against an external attacker with no access to 
the target system or the server, but someone with enough knowledge and 
access privileges on the target system would be no problem at all to 
save the key to a file using the above command and later on use it a will.


So i suggest you first think about against what attacks you have to 
"withstand", how resourceful a potential attacker is or may be, how much 
control you have over the target system, how much is the value of the 
information and how much is the cost or what are the risks when the 
time-limits are violated and last but not least much inevitable risk is 
acceptable(tm) as there is nothing like absolute security.

Because the "head ... | uuencode ... | head ... | tail ..." pipe sends a
random passphrase to stdin of losetup. By default, losetup prompts and reads
a passphrase from controlling terminal, not stdin. If losetup is given a
"-p0" command line parameter, then losetup reads a passphrase from stdin.

In your example, if losetup were to read a random passphrase from stdin,
then losetup would not be able to decrypt the gpg encrypted key file. Random
passphrase is not same as the one you used to encrypt the key file.

Thanks, all clear about this question.
If you want, can explain me this procedure (from loopAES.README - 
Example 2):

head -c 15 /dev/urandom | uuencode -m - | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 \
        | losetup -p 0 -e AES128 /dev/loop3 /dev/hda666
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/loop3 bs=4k conv=notrunc 2&gt;/dev/null
    

The first encrypt the block device /dev/hda666 using a random passphrase 
then, the second, fill all the partition with all zero. Is it right?
The scope is to create a "base" on which write the encrypted data?
All this to increase the safety of data encryption?
Thanks again.

That example pulls low quality random passphrase from /dev/urandom, and then
fills the partition with encrypted zeroes. Then encrypted loop is set up
again using your real high quality keys, and encrypted file system is
created there.

Intent is to fill unused space with random looking junk so that adversary
can't detect what parts of the filesystem have been written.

Regarding /dev/urandom as a source of entropy the way it is set up in
most linux distribution is a good joke :-) That's all I wanted to
point out. However, if it's used to wipe a HDD, fine with me cos that
has not much todo with crypto stuff. And Jari basically agreed, IIRC.


&gt; &gt; Don't forget to check your system's init scripts for the
&gt; &gt; initialization of /dev/urandom
&gt; Urandom debian script seem like slackware script. What is the solution? 
&gt; Sholud we use /dev/random instead of /dev/urandom?

Like Tobias already said, it depends on how /dev/random is set up, if
it is at all. On some systems there's even /dev/hwrandom, which I
would prefer were it present on all my systems. I believe some VIA
systems have that ability; I operate a Nehemiah System on a patched
2.6.7 kernel which only has /dev/urandom /dev/random &amp; /hwtrap
(whatever that's for). What this boils down to is crypto scripts -
one has to be aware of obvious snares. If one writes his own init
routines &amp; scripts or continues using distro stuff it totally up to
the user.

If you initialize /dev/urandom yourself by making sure that the same
data is not reused again in crypto ops it's ok. Same applies to
/dev/random, which should be ok to use. If I need some pseudo-random
data I generate it on the spot.

To clarify things regarding loop-aes: It's ok to re-use pseudo-random
data to wipe some HDD. It's a totally different issue to re-use
pseudo-random data to do real encryption stuff; one shall not use the
very same gpg-key to encrypt more than one partition, either. Simply
put: If in doubt, just create one more chunk of pseudo-random data;
this never is a bad idea, and it doesn't hurt to have used an
additional gpg-key if it comes to system compromise.

What is wrong with -lcrypt? Nothing.

Not sure why rpcgen output does not compile, but there is nothing wrong with
pregenerated nfsmount.h nfsmount_xdr.c nfsmount_clnt.c files.

When ./configure script is run, it saves rpcgen error messages to file
called conferrs, but that file is removed on line 710 in ./configure script.
Maybe you can change the script to not remove that file so you can see those
error messages.

&gt; So, can I replace the singles patched executables (mount, umount,
&gt; losetup, swapon, swapoff)?

Yes.

petersen wrote:
&gt; To my understanding, the danger is that the filesystem terminates an
&gt; operation and updates the journal. The harddisk write cache somehow
&gt; manage to write the updated journal info, but when about to write the
&gt; filedata themselves, power is lost.

Yes, danger is in ordering of writes:
1) log intent of doing something dangerous
2) do dangerous operation
3) log dangerous operation completed

Write #2 or #3 must not hit disk platters before write #1, and write #3 must
not hit disk platters before write #2. If power is lost, journal replay on
next mount is able to fix partially completed operation.

The problem with enabled disk write cache is that the disk may say "write
complete" to kernel driver before the data hits disk platters, and after
that disk may re-order multiple pending writes.

&gt; Wouldn't that be a general problem with any journalised filesystem?

Yes.

&gt; If so, as most OS'es nowadays have journalised filesystems, does the
&gt; modern harddisks have ways to prevent such problems, or does the harddisk
&gt; (filesystem?) driver implement some 'sync'-function before commiting the
&gt; journal?

To get write ordering right, kernel driver must issue cache flush command to
the disk, or in case where cache flush command is not available, cache
disable + cache enable command sequence may also flush pending writes.
 
That is what block I/O write barriers do. 2.6 kernels now support them on
some block devices. Device backed loop-AES driver maintains correct write
order and supports write barriers if underlying device supports write
barriers. Mainline loop driver supports neither barriers nor correct
ordering of writes.

&gt; Perhaps I should clarify the question, I was thinking on journalising
&gt; filesystems (ext3) on nonencrypted drives as well, eg. shouldn't
&gt; _any_ ext3-user, also someone not using encryption, disable
&gt; write-cache? Or is this case different because you have:
&gt; 
&gt; ext3
&gt;   |
&gt;   v
&gt; loop
&gt;   |
&gt;   v
&gt; physical driver, /dev/hda

Same write cache problems and solutions apply to both device backed loop-AES
and to ext3 file system directly on partition. Journaling file system on
file backed loop is FUBAR on both mainline and loop-AES versions.

&gt; In the end it comes down to finding the risk of just using
&gt; write-cache anyway, with loop-aes and ext3, I mean, ext3 &amp;
&gt; write-cache disk are probably what most people use today, and it
&gt; seems to me even in the write-cache enabled case, ext3 loses far less
&gt; data than ext2.

If a box has any data that is worth something, it probably has an UPS. On
UPS powered boxes, it is best to leave disk write caches enabled.

&gt; On another topic: shouldn't the KEYSCRUB option be enabled by default?

Maybe. Performance cost is less than 1%. Keyscrub version needs to allocate
about twice the amount of RAM to hold expanded encryption keys: 40 KB for
normal multi-key for each initialized device, 76 KB for keyscrub version.
Not everyone likes that.

&gt; So baseline, must I prepare my kernel (use 2.6, select some option or

Last time I checked, ext3 barrier mount required 'barrier=1' mount option
in /etc/fstab .

&gt; Does ext3/loop-aes encryption increase risks compared to ext3/plain?

Device backed loop-AES does not increase write order related risk.

&gt; If loop-aes maintains write-order, then I suppose ext3/loop-aes and
&gt; ext3/plain have same risks.

Encrypted data has bigger data corruption risk on hardware failure. One bit
ciphertext read error will completely destroy one or more 16 byte plaintext
blocks, but errors still stay within same 512 byte sector where the one bit
error is.

&gt; KEYSCRUB=n could still be available for aficionados. However, I'd
&gt; really like to see someone recovering the key from 'wornout
&gt; ram-oxide'.

If some three letter government agency is capable of doing that, they
probably stay mum about it.

I almost forgot: Anyone compiling loop-AES for Xen Linux, must not enable
KEYSCRUB=y for now. There is privilege related bug that prevents it from
running correctly on some versions of Xen.

I believe it to be secure. 3072 bit RSA is equivalent to AES-128 strength.
If I remember correctly, NSA does not recommend RSA for U.S. government use.
They seem to prefer ECC.

If adversary has access to your public key and passphrase encrypted private
key, then key file encrypted using symmetric-cipher-only may be little bit
more secure. If adversary does not have access to your public/private keys,
then RSA encrypted key file is more secure. Human memorizable passphrase is
usually the weakest link.

Seems for the "simple" 3&lt; cases i just used the wrong order.

The "process substitution"-cases gave me a headache at first (Just got 
syntax-errors).

They don't seem work from a Shell-Script with "#!/bin/sh" as shebang. 
But after trying them on the commandline and then with "#!/bin/bash" as 
shebang they work like charm. :-))

"ls -la /bin/sh" shows a symlink to bash. Guess there are some 
compatibility things that can throw with stones. ;-)

Ciphertext tampering attacks in CBC mode, and ciphertext copying attacks

No such plans yet.

If adversary can modify ciphertext residing on local hard disk partition,
then security game was already lost.

&gt; The best thing though would be if you develop together with the

Mainline Linux folks are still years behind loop-AES.

I think this sentence in the paper:

"The attack was not taken seriously, especially not by me, as Jari Ruusu had
 no good reputation and was known to spread more confusion than facts."

should really read as:

"The attack was not taken seriously by clueless people, author included, as
 Jari Ruusu had a reputation of not tolerating people who prefer and
 recommend broken crypto implementations."

Hello everyone

I really do not know anything about this topic; I simply read the article. 
If you don't believe it, that's fine with me; perhaps it is wrong. I sure 
didn't write it. : )

Concerning Markus' question

&gt;Maybe you'd like to quote the passage that concers you, regarding a
&gt;specific setup (f.e., encrypted /home &amp; swap, /tmp in ram) and why
&gt;exactly, with regard to the afforementioned setup, could it result in
&gt;data leakage?

I was not clear, sorry. I was just asking if *not* using a disk partition as 
swap (either by not having swap at all or using memory as swap, as the 
article describes) completely eliminated concerns of having data contained 
in some encrypted file being written unencrypted to other disk sectors. I 
understand that (disk-based) swapping is a prime mechanism by which that 
happens; I was just asking if, by eliminating that swapping, there still 
were other ways in which sensitive data might get written in unencrypted 
form to other disk locations.

Well, that's all folks! Now I would be grateful if you could answer the 
brief loop-AES question I am posting to the list simultaneously.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi Marvin,

Each key is 45 random (assuming /dev/random is random) base-64 characters. So
the entropy available per key is 64^45 = 1.897x10^81. 256 bits of entropy is
one in 2^256 = 1.157920e+77 which is all that ever gets used (think of it as a
combination lock with 2^256 possibilities). So in fact there is plenty of
entropy, good enough for a 256 bit key - the actual key used is likely the
SHA-256 hash of the plain text key anyhow - Jari can confirm.

Cheers,

Please ignore my previous emails, just fixed it! Actually, "fixing" is 
wrong: it was working all along, only that the system console got moved to a 
tty other than tty1 and hence I couldn't see the system boot... : )

My thanks for this amazing piece of work; especial congratulations on the 
incredibly detailed, "hold-my-hand-through-the-entire-process" README file!

Cheers

&gt;Subject: computer hangs booting kernel
&gt;Date: Wed, 26 Oct 2005 21:04:13 -0400
&gt;
&gt;Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt;I finally got a few hours to setup a loop-AES encrypted root partition on 
&gt;my machine. I religiously followed the readme and on the second attempt it 
&gt;worked: I successfully booted from a usb-drive into the encrypted root 
&gt;partition.
&gt;
&gt;However, something obviously went wrong when I subsequently recompiled the 
&gt;kernel to add a driver I had forgotten to include the first time I built 
&gt;it. It is the same kernel version for which I had built the loop-aes module 
&gt;(2.4.31), but I nonetheless rebuilt the module, too. I moved the new kernel 
&gt;image and System.map files into /boot, copied the module from 
&gt;/lib/modules/2.4.31/block/loop.o into /boot/modules-2.4.31/loop.o and again 
&gt;copied all files from /boot to the usb key. Then I reran syslinux /dev/sda 
&gt;and sync'ed.
&gt;
&gt;However, ever since I did this my computer hangs when booting from the key:
&gt;
&gt;SYSLINUX 2.11 ...
&gt;Loading vmlinuz...
&gt;Loading initrd.gz...
&gt;Ready.
&gt;Uncompressing Linux... Ok,  booting the kernel.
&gt;
&gt;And it hangs there (in fact, the cursor is still blinking, so I don't know 
&gt;if it is technically speaking "hanged"). Using a knoppix cd and the 
&gt;rootkey.gpg on my usb key I can successfully mount the encrypted root 
&gt;partition and use my system "as usual", so I know that the problem resides 
&gt;in the contents of the usb key.
&gt;
&gt;Could anyone please give me some guidance on what to check given that it 
&gt;hangs at the "Ok,  booting the kernel" stage? My kernel config still 
&gt;matches the requirements on the readme. What might be going wrong?
&gt;
&gt;In the meantime I completely rebuilt the usb-key (erased all its contents 
&gt;except for the rootkey.gpg file, reran the build-initrd.sh script) and the 
&gt;problem persists.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks so much for any help,
&gt;
&gt;Marvin

hey all... sorry about that, it's a reply to a post at hlfs-dev.  funny 
though, it deals with applying blowfish to shadow-4.0.13, so check it 
out if you like: 
http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/hlfs-dev/2005-October/002484.html

  ~ brad.

&gt;from how the code is structured, blowfish should be default after the
&gt;compile.  just run passwd(1) so your shadow file will then be
&gt;blowfish-encrypted.  (pretty sure you don't want to try to
&gt;authenticate an MD5 password with Blowfish.)  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;enjoy yourself,
&gt;  ~ brad.

Marvin Lyndon wrote:
&gt; The trouble is that the system boots the new kernel and then complains:
&gt; 
&gt; Mounting /dev/sda as /lib failed
&gt; 
&gt; Some googling reminded me that the naming convention for devices changes
&gt; with 2.6: so I tried editing my /boot/initrd.conf so that  it read
&gt; 
&gt; CRYPTROOT=/dev/discs/disc0/part1 (formerly /dev/hda1)
&gt; BOOTDEV=/dev/discs/disc1  (formerly /dev/sda?)

These look like devfs names. devfs names work only if USEDEVFS=1 is set in
build-initrd.sh configuration, and CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y
are set in kernel configuration.

If you don't have devfs enabled, like you said, you should not be using
devfs names in build-initrd.sh configuration.

&gt; I am pretty much guessing concerning the second device name; how can I find
&gt; the new correct name for /dev/sda if I cannot boot the 2.6 kernel?

Observe boot kernel boot messages. If some device is not detected, it may be
caused by needed driver not being linked directly to the kernel.

&gt; But even if I get past this hurdle, I find myself in a catch-22 situation:
&gt; trying to run buildinitrd.sh (needed because I changed /boot/initrd.conf)
&gt; fails with an error message stating that it cannot find the device nodes:
&gt; 
&gt; This
&gt; ***  script was supposed to create block device nodes for     ***
&gt; ***  BOOTDEV=, CRYPTROOT= and possibly EXTERNALGPGDEV= but    ***
&gt; ***  lacked knowledge of how to create at least one of them.  ***
&gt; ***  Script aborted.

This is fixed by not using devfs names in build-initrd.sh configuration.
 
&gt; How can I get buildinitrd.sh to succeed in configuring the initrd for use
&gt; with a 2.6 kernel while still running a 2.4 kernel?

Normally one initrd.gz should work with all kernels, However, if the device
names are different under different kernels, then you need to build two
different initrds using different configurations.

Add this to 2.4 kernel version build-initrd.sh configuration:

    INITRDGZNAME=initrd1.gz

and this to 2.6 version:

    INITRDGZNAME=initrd2.gz

syslinux.cfg example:

    default linux24
    timeout 100
    prompt 1
    label linux24
      kernel vmlinuz1
      append initrd=initrd1.gz root=100 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix
    label linux26
      kernel vmlinuz2
      append initrd=initrd2.gz root=100 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix

&gt; 1st. Encrypting information twice.
&gt; For instance: An RSA encrypted mail is stored on a loop-aes encrypted

Some block cipher operating modes, such as OFB and CTR, use block cipher as
sort of PRNG and XOR the plaintext with PRNG output. Applying two such
layers of encryption, using identical key and IV at same data offset, will
effectively cancel each other out.

Loop-AES uses CBC mode so above does not apply to it.

&gt; 2nd. Encrypting information more times.
&gt; For instance: Backups are done on removeable media. Each one is encrypted with
&gt; a different set of keys for loop-aes, but also containing very similar data.

No problem there.

That can work only in case when you set esp's encryption keys manually
and the same on all 30 your clients. Also, SPIs should be the same. I
would not call such setup secure.

Better way is to put all these clients into single subnet and configure
them to require transport mode esp transformation in that subnet +
employ automatic keying and auth by certs. And required subset of these
scarry 900 tunnels will set up automatically. [Don't ask me how to
configure this setup in windows -- I don't know].

&gt; I hope that someone can help me with finding this portion of the code
&gt; and modify it. By the way I searched in the kernel file "esp4.c" but

Check xfrm*.c files, also net/xfrm directory.

Hi Christoffer,

&gt; Btw. is ext2 a journaling filesystem?

No, ext2 has no journal.  ext3 is a journaling file system.

Is this perhaps a udev related problem?

Hi everyone,

I have an OpenSWAN (2.3.1) box accepting ipsec tunnels from wireless 
(802.11) clients equipped with Linux and Windows XP.
Wireless clients are using the openswan gateway to exchange data securely 
between each other, so there are no direct tunnels between client 
themselves.
The gateway is doing the routing job fine but there is a security gap when 
it has to decrypt data sent by a given client and then reencrypt it before 
sending it to the ultimate destination. It may be better not to expose the 
data in the clear at the gateway.

I know this can be solved by using double encryption (tunnel inside a  
tunnel), but, I wonder if  there is a better alternative?
I was thinking of using L2TP/IPSec tunnels instead of pure IPSec tunnels, 
and then, maybe I can use L2TP encryption to encrypt end-to-end and IPSec 
encryption to encrypt end-to-gateway. Would this work?

I appreciate any help and advices.

Alaadin

Hi!

I was wondering what you are using as filesystem on the backend and on
the container? I'm aware that I shouldn't use journaling, but is there a
preferred filesystem regarding performance and stability? And is it
preferred to use the same filesystem on the backend and on the
container?

Thanks for a great project!!

If you use loop-aes for file partitions you don't have problems using
a journaling file system.

If you mount a file via loop, you shouldn't use journaling filesystems
for this mount. Journaling filesystems can lead to deadlock situations.

The filesystem for the loop file dosn't have this problem.
As far as I know you can use here journaling file systems without problems.

I don't have done performance tests for different filesystems so far.

hello everyone,

I am trying to setup a windows xp machine as a vpn server that accepts 
multiple ipsec tunnels from other windows xp machines.

My restrictions are the following:

1- I need to set the vpn server on windows XP (not windows 2000 server, nor 
2003, nor ISA server, etc.)

2- I need to use tunnel mode ipsec

3- The vpn server should accept MULTIPLE vpn tunnels.

The first problem I faced is that windows xp does not support ipsec tunnel 
mode between 2 xp machines. It only supports transport mode which is not 
what I want.
To overcome this lack of IP tunneling I tried to use the built-in tunneling 
capabilities such as PPTP and L2TP/ipsec, and it worked. But the problem 
here is that a windows xp can not accept more than ONE SINGLE incoming 
connection at a time, and I need multiple connections.

I think the solution could be one of the following:

1-Installing a third party FREE vpn server (or L2TP server) on windows XP. 
If you know one please tell me.

2-Importing some features from windows 2000 server or 2003 server (some 
executables or services or plugins that enable xp to run as a vpn server and 
accept multiple connections). If you know what to import please tell me.

3- Installing a pure IP tunneling solution on windows xp so that it can be 
combined with ipsec encryption to yield tunnel mode encryption.

I appreciate any help,

Alaadin

Hi Wolfgang!

Thanks for the reply, it really cleared things up!
I thought that it was the other way round, that could cause trouble - to
use journaling on the filesystem, but not on the loop.
Btw. is ext2 a journaling filesystem?

Thanks ones again!

using debian (unstable) with kernel 2.6.13 (vanilla from kernel.org) doesn't
mount the swapspace that should be mounted via
/dev/sda2       none    swap    sw,loop=/dev/loop6,encryption=AES128    0 0
in /etc/fstab.

i did compile the loop-aes and loop-aes-ciphers after building the kernel,
of course. is there any known problem with it? it still worked with the
latest official debian 2.6.11 kernel!

TIA :)

Hi all, my first post, and first time with loop-aes, but I may(?) have
found a bug or at least need help with a problem I'm having.

Situation:
loop-aes 3.0d with gentoo 2.6.12.5, (read the loop-aes readme, followed
all directions) and used knoppix to do the actual encrypting commands.
In the build-initrd.sh script, because I have a 2.6 kernel and I'm using
USEPIVOT=1, with AES256 and a rootkey.gpg file, and have my kernel
compiled with all the correct options (ram disk, initrd support, minix,
no cramfs) and am using the correct fstab entry of /dev/loop5 for the
root drive.  The file system on both /boot and / is ext2 and I'm using
udev for device management.

The grub.conf entry is:

title l33t Gentoo Linux
root (hd0,1)
kernel /kernel root=100 init=/linuxrc
initrd /initrd.gz

which I know works because I get to the part where I enter the password,
as opposed to getting init= or wrong fs-type errors.
When I enter the correct password I get the following message:

pivot_root() to new root failed.  Older kernels don't have pivot_root().

I have not looked at the code, but does this mean initrd thinks I have
an older kernel, as opposed to 2.6.12.5?  I googled this, but nothing
came up - what to do?  My box is not so l33t now :-(

Please help,
David

Hello list, Hello Jari,

I'm using loop-AES on my laptop or a few years.  All filesystems are
loop-AES-encrypted on lvm volumes. Today I had to enlarge my /home
partition. As you certainly know, lvm volumes can grow online and
meanwhile at least reiserfs and ext3 have the ability to resize a
filesystem on-line. But unfortunately the loop device layer which
resides between those two does not grow with the underlying block
device.

I was bored tonight, and had a look at the loop-aes source to find out
whether it would be possible to adjust a loop device to the new size
of its its underlying block device.  I think I have found a way, but I
am not competent enough to see whether I break something with it.  It
works for me so far that I can create a file-backed loop device,
create a reiserfs on it and mount it, append a few megabytes to the
container file, call my new LOOP_RESET_SIZE ioctl and resize the file
system with resize_reiserfs, while the fs is mounted.

Maybe you can have a quick look on it. Is it really so simple or am I
missing some important point here?  Would it be worth the effort to
include a this functionality into losetup? I haven't written C for
many years and have never read or written any kernel code before
today, so please don't expect too much.  I would really appreciate any
comment.

Regards,
Jim

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Added block I/O priority support. (2.6 kernels)
- Added VIA padlock hardware AES support. (2.4 and 2.6 kernels)
- Added losetup -R option which recomputes size of loop device. Useful with
  loop device on top of LVM volume. Patch from Jim MacBaine. (2.4 and 2.6
  kernels)

Forgive the ignorance, but in the new loop-aes, what does block I/O
priority support mean, what does it do, and does it make the drives data
more secure?  Also, how is it used/activated?

Thx,
David

Dear All,
please, any help appreciated:
I'm using gentoo with encrypted partitions on the disk. Yesterday I did
update of the machine with 'emerge --sync; emerge world'. After this
upgrade it's no longer possible to mount the encrypted disk partitions.
I've tried to go back with the version of util-linux, but no success. Here
are some logs:

-----------------------------
it's visible that the util-linux package is upgraded from 2.12q-r1 to
2.12q-r3. Unfortunately ebuild r1 is no mo accessible, so i'm not able
to load back exactly the version which was installed. Instead, i've
tested 2.12q and 2.12q-r2 with no success.

pleaseplease what's wrong? i desperately need the access to data


--- btw: kernel: Linux aleek 2.6.12-gentoo-r10 #15 Thu Sep 1 03:53:43

but the kernel was not changed during yesterday's update.

any advice highly appreciated

I've been playing around with loop-aes and aespipe lately, and have
encrypted my hard drive with loop-aes, but want to decrypt it, and
re-encrypt it with a new key.

As a test before I try this with my actual hard drive I encrypted a USB
key chain I have with a dummy file (using a key)

sda = usb device name
key.gpg = a AES256 symmetric gpg key, so no -G option needed

I encrypted it using

dd if=/dev/sda bs=64k | aespipe -e AES256 -K /key.gpg | dd of=/dev/sda
bs=64k conv=notrunc

I mounted it on a loop saw the dummy file and unmounted it:

mount /dev/sda /mnt/sda -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES256,gpgkey=/key.gpg

umount /mnt/sda

Then when I decrypted it:

dd if=/dev/sda bs=64k | aespipe -d -K /key.gpg | dd of=/dev/sda bs=64k
conv=notrunc

Then I tried to normally mount it with no loop because it was decrypted
and there were problems

mount /dev/sda
wrong filetype, bad superblock...

mount -t auto, mount -t vfat, mount -t ext2, mount -t ext3... all
produced the same error message.

Does the decryption process somehow destroy the filesystem structure or
superblock.  How can I decrypt this and still have a usable drive?  Is
there another step?  I am no filesystem expert, but has anyone done this
and seen expected results?

TIA,
David

I guess this is what you are looking for

However, if something goes wrong during the process, your data is
lost. Better have a backup handy.

I'm not sure about this, but above 'encryption=aes' option looks like it was
set up using mainline util-linux.

For some brief period, mainline util-linux used loop key setup method that
was not compatible with neither earlier nor later version of mainline
util-linux. There is small possibility that your setup uses such
incompatible version.

&gt; it's visible that the util-linux package is upgraded from 2.12q-r1 to

Knowing what version of software was used to set it up, and having the
sources available, would help a lot here.

If you are using loop-AES version of mount, you can try these mount options
in your /etc/fstab file:

encryption=AES,phash=unhashed1      # loop-AES-v1.0c compatible
encryption=AES128,phash=unhashed2   # weirdo-mainline util-linux compatible

&gt; 

In addition to Jari's suggestions, I would think that the following would have
changed: util-linux. I know that the "stable" version does NOT have Jari's
losetup and mount patch and the "unstable" version does.

So ensure that you have the line:

sys-apps/util-linux ~x86

in /etc/portage/package.keywords

and then:

# emerge -av util-linux

and recompile. This will ensure that you have a compatible losetup to try
Jari's suggestions.

Also you need to ensure that you have a valid loop-aes compatible loop.ko
module loaded. If your sources pointed to by /usr/src/linux are the sources
used to compile your running kernel, the following will ensure you have the
latest loop module:

in /etc/portage/package.keywords add:

sys-fs/loop-aes ~x86

and then

# emerge -av loop-aes

which should compile and install version 3.0d of loop-aes if I recall right.

Ensure that the loop module loads at boot time by editing

/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6

and adding "loop" without the double quotes on an empty line.

Then reboot and try Jari's suggestions.

Having the correct entries in the /etc/portage.keywords file will ensure that
the next time util-linux is updated by a world upgrade you get the loop-aes
compatible version.

Thanks, Jim. I merged your patch with some changes.

&gt; Is it really so simple or am I missing some important point here?

You missed 32 bit userland on 64 bit kernel "weirdo" part. On newer kernels
when 32 bit program makes ioctl call to 64 bit driver, the driver must
handle those ioctls using -&gt;compat_ioctl() hook. On older kernels,
register_ioctl32_conversion() can be used to tag 32 bit ioctls so that they
get passed to 64 bit driver. I added code for both methods, so that one of
them can be compiled into the driver. It depends on kernel version which
method gets used.

I also changed the ioctl number to:
#define LOOP_RECOMPUTE_DEV_SIZE 0x4C52

Why? Because the code 0x4C07 you used is likely to end up having a conflict
with some other loop ioctl function.

Few years ago, Red Had kernels used 0x4C04 loop ioctl, and later, mainline
kernels defined that same code for completely different purpose. Mount and
losetup programs still have special code that attempts to detect if they are
running on old RH kernel, and work around the problem if necessary. Works,
but it isn't pretty.

&gt; Would it be worth the effort to include a this functionality into losetup?

Done. It is now "losetup -R /dev/loop0", unless someone vetoes that.

&gt; loop-aes 3.0d with gentoo 2.6.12.5, (read the loop-aes readme, followed

On what root directory did you run the build-initrd.sh script?
Your about-to-be-encrypted-root or knoppix?

Last few lines of build-initrd.sh script is supposed to make sure that a
/initrd directory exists on your about-to-be-encrypted-root directory. If
you ran the script on knoppix, then that directory may be missing.

&gt; When I enter the correct password I get the following message:
&gt; 
&gt; pivot_root() to new root failed.  Older kernels don't have pivot_root().

That error message can be caused by missing pivot_root() system call in
kernel or because your encrypted root does not have a /initrd directory.

When pivot_root() system call is run, it atomically moves old existing
ram-disk based root directory to some other directory and moves newly set up
encrypted directory to root directory. Old root directory can't just vanish
because a program (linuxrc) is running from it.

In your case, it appears that the directory where old ram-disk based root
directory is supposed to be "parked" is missing. Fix is to create that
missing directory.

&gt; Please help

1)  Boot knoppix 3.9 or later. Knoppix 3.9 seems to have full support for
    mounting loop-AES-v3 encrypted file systems. You don't need any GUI for
    this, so run knoppix run level 2 will do.

        boot: knoppix 2

2)  Mount device where your rootkey.gpg file is.

        mkdir /mnt1
        mount -r -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /mnt1

3)  Mount your encrypted root.

        mkdir /mnt2
        mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt2 -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES256,gpgkey=/mnt1/rootkey.gpg

4)  Create missing directory.

        umask 077
        mkdir /mnt2/initrd

5)  Clean up and reboot.

        umount /mnt2
        umount /mnt1

Kernel 2.6.12 is fine and has the pivot_root functionality.  Please

David's problem was resolved. He told me so in private reply. The problem
was caused by missing 'initrd' directory on his encrypted root partition.

David ran the build-initrd.sh script on knoppix, but didn't configure
DESTINATIONROOT= to point to his encrypted root directory. So the
build-initrd.sh script checked and/or created a 'initrd' directory on
ram-disk based knoppix root directory instead of his encrypted root
directory.

Fine! So is there now a manual for building a Knoppix CD that can access
loop-aes encrypted CDs/DVDs/harddisks?
Spb-linux is said to support loop-aes but I never saw it working. A full
Knoppix environment would be nice.

the correct loop module loaded?

Was the 2.6.11 kernel running on same box or different box?
What does following command output?

    strings -a /sbin/swapon | grep "unable to open loop device"

It should output "swapon: unable to open loop device %s".
If it doesn't output that, then you are running wrong swapon program.

the only error message is 'activating swap ... failed' during boot. even
dmesg doesn't say anything about it. and after booting losetup -a doesn't
show any loop.

during boot the loop module is loaded a little bit after trying to activate
the swap partition. maybe that could be the reason?! but with a debian
kernel the whole thing works ...

I have this problem, too.

The encrypted swap works fine.

The problem is that the linux startup scripts attempt to initialize  
swap before loading the loop-aes module.

Simply try to execute swapon -a as root after the machine is up and  
it should work fine.

This could be fixed with some /etc/init.d script dependency stuff, I  
think..

I strongly suspect it is udev that prevents the autoload.

When swapon is first run during boot (in S10checkroot.sh), only the
/dev/loop/0 device node exists. Other loop devices than loop0 swapon
can't open and hence the normal autoloading mechanism won't work.

It probably worked with 2.6.11 because recent versions of udev in
unstable disable themselves when they are running under a kernel &lt;
2.6.12, and leave the old /dev in place which has the loop device
nodes and allows the normal autoloading to work.

Tobias, does it make a difference if you add loop to /etc/modules?
It should be possible to explicitly load the loop module that way
before the second swapon attempt happens in S35mountall.sh.

cheers,
Max

BTW: You can ignore the error message from "Activating swap".
Modules are only loaded after the first swapon, so this error is
expected. It used to be silently ignore until Debian initscripts 
recently started using lsb functions in unstable.

no. it was one of my first attempts to get it running. didn't help

hm, i will take a look at S35mountall.sh.

OK ;)

max, thanx a lot! it really seems that the whole thing is due to udev and
the start- / mount-scripts. will have to (and can ;) live with that

OK, too bad :) That helped on my udev test system.

Thinking about it, perhaps there is some race condition involved when
udev creates the device nodes. ISTR that this happens asynchronously to
the modprobe command, so when the modprobe returns it is not certain
that all loop device nodes have been created. 

To further debug this it would help to remove the stderr redirection
from swapon calls in S10checkroot.sh and S35mountall.sh. Perhaps you
could try to add a sleep 5 before the swapon in mountall.sh and see if
that makes a difference. Another idea would be" ls -l /dev/loop*; lsmod|
grep loop" before and after the swapons. 

&gt; it really seems that the whole thing is due to udev and the start- /
&gt; mount-scripts. will have to (and can ;) live with that

That's OK, but if we can solve it we should try. Discussion goes
towards making it the default in future Debian releases, so this will
probably be affecting more people in the not-too-distant future.

Max

At least the Knoppix 4.0.1 DVD comes with loop-aes 3.0d on-board.

&gt; &gt; Would it be worth the effort to include a this functionality into losetup?
&gt; 
&gt; Done. It is now "losetup -R /dev/loop0", unless someone vetoes that.

"losetup -R /dev/loop0" seems to work okay on LVM2 volumes. Unpatched
ext2online tool used to resize mounted ext3 file system seems to have little
problem. If encrypted file system is mounted like this:

  losetup -e AES128 -K /etc/fubar.gpg /dev/loop0 /dev/mapper/foo-bar
  mount -t ext3 /dev/loop0 /mnt

Then ext2online should work without modifications (I didn't test above type
mount). However, above type mount does not detach the loop device
automatically on umount. Usually I put loop options to /etc/fstab, which is
equivalent to this type mount:

  mount -t ext3 /dev/mapper/foo-bar /mnt -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128,gpgkey=/etc/fubar.gpg
    
That makes umount detach the loop device automatically. But... with above
type mount options, ext2online failed to find the clear-text device
/dev/loop0 from mount options, saying it couldn't find ext3 superblock on
/dev/mapper/foo-bar. Of course it can't find any superblock in there,
because that data is encrypted.

Below is a patch that makes ext2online understand loop mount options and
makes it look for the superblock in the loop device. This patch fixed the
problem for me.

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Added block I/O priority support. (2.6 kernels)
- Added VIA padlock hardware AES support. (2.4 and 2.6 kernels)
- Added losetup -R option which recomputes size of loop device. Useful with
  loop device on top of LVM volume. Patch from Jim MacBaine. (2.4 and 2.6
  kernels)

&gt; what does block I/O priority support mean, what does it do

File system code can set an I/O elevator priority to read and write requests
that it sends to block device driver. It is up to the disk I/O elevator code
code to schedule high priority requests to be processed earlier than low
priority requests.

I added one line of code to loop that copies original priority of read and
write requests to the request that loop sends to underlying device.

   read or write request here, with some I/O priority
             |
             v
file system ---&gt; loop ---&gt; IDE or SCSI driver
                       ^
                       |
             same I/O priority copied here

But... I looked at the code again today, and noticed that the bitfield of
the structure where priority is stored, is already copied some source code
lines earlier. Me adding code that sets it again was silly. That second
unnecessary copy doesn't do any harm other than waste few processor cycles,
and embarrass me.

&gt; and does it make the drives data more secure?

No.

&gt; Also, how is it used/activated?

Quick recursive grep of mainline 2.6.13 kernel source does not show any code
that that uses bio_set_prio() to set I/O priority to non-default value. It
is not of much use today.

Yes Yes. Sorry I didn't notice that it was private response. Thx a lot to all,
problem is solved now by choosing the AES256 with unhashed2 hash type. Anyway I'll have to
change my system, because the way I installed that on my system is not very clever.

Loop-AES and aespipe on-disk format is headerless because ciphertext must
fit exactly same space as plaintext. No header to tell what key size was
used to encrypt means that you have to specify that same info for decryption
too.
