Hi folks,

is there any reason why I don't find any  loop-hvr, loop-jari and
patch-aes-asm for kernel 2.4.23?

Hi guys,

In the examples, uuencode seems to always be used when
creating a pass phase.

My question: is there any real reason the pass phase
needs to be uuencoded if losetup will have it piped in
with the -p option? 

I tried piping in raw output generated from
/dev/random and it seems to work. Just want to make
sure that does not some how weaken the encryption...  

Thanks, and sorry if I've missed something obvious...

Rob

Someone else can correct me if wrong, but I think it's
now historical artifact. uuencode used to be used to
create an ascii one time password from some random
data source; you know have to use an external program
to do regular ascii passwords in the old way. (Ben Slusky's

Nope. He does not _have_ to use external program. Only people who _choose_
to run the most vulnerable crypto they can find (i.e. cryptoloop) do that.

Oh, come on Jaari. Quit knocking other peoples' work
for no good reason. Boost your own code if you wish, but
lay off on the sniping at HVR and others who have done
a lot of very hard and very good work.

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Modified build-initrd.sh so that initrd loads loop module using .ko
  extension on 2.6 kernels. Previous version always used .o extension.
- Removed 2.6.1-mm5 Makefile breakage workaround.
- Modified Pentium assembler implementation detection to work with new style
  CPU selection code that is present in some 2.6 kernels.
- Changed some build-initrd.sh defaults. New defaults are: USEGPGKEY=1,
  USEPIVOT=1, and USEDIETLIBC=1
- Updated loop code to be compatible with Pavel Machek's software suspend
  code (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).

Hi all,

 

I want to use KAME tools as IPSec in a 2.4.22 project for compatibility with 2.6 in \
the future.  Does anyone know where I can get a 2.6 IPSec back port for 2.4.22?  I \
found there is a patch for 2.4.21, but it still needs some manual fix to work.

 

Thanks in advance.

Oh, come on Daale. Pretending that cryptoloop does not have exploitable

If you used same version of aespipe to encrypt and decrypt, and same command
line syntax (except -d option for decrypt), it should have decrypted your
file system correctly. aespipe-v2.1c and older do not not understand
multi-key mode. Using aespipe-v2.1c with multi-key gpg key files will result
in mess. What version of aespipe you used to encrypt and decrypt? If both
were v2.2a or later and you still can't mount your file system, then I
conclude that your file system is FUBAR. Time to re-install and/or restore

The INSTALL_MOD_PATH= specifies the _root_ of the destination, just like it
does in the kernel Makefiles. You really installed files to

    /lib/modules/2.6.2/kernel/drivers/block/lib/modules/2.6.2/block/

To get rid of these incorrectly installed files, do this:

    rm -r /lib/modules/2.6.2/kernel/drivers/block/lib

Since you already are running 2.6.2 kernel and want to compile and install
modules for it, simplest way to do that is this:

    tar xvfj loop-AES-v2.0f.tar.bz2
    cd loop-AES-v2.0f
    make
    cd ..
    tar xvfj ciphers-v2.0f.tar.bz2
    cd ciphers-v2.0f

Looks like that can be used to save software suspend image to encrypted loop
device. Encryption keys that were in kernel RAM at time of suspend are
protected by encryption, so the keys will not leak.

Simultaneous use of encrypted root partition + initrd-swsusp is going to
need more tweaks. Initrd code has to set up different loop device depending
if computer is doing normal boot to encrypted root or resume from encrypted
swsusp image. Maybe it is possible to set up both loops with same password
but different gpg encrypted key file.

You can decrypt your root partition using exactly same command syntax as you
used to encrypt it, except add -d option to aespipe for 'decryption'. Then
you can re-run the 'encrypt' command pipe again with correct encryption
options.

If you want to view seed and iteration in existing initrd.gz file, do
something like this:

    zcat initrd.gz &gt;z
    mount -r -t minix z /mnt -o loop
    strings -a /mnt/linuxrc | less
    umount /mnt

In multi-key mode, mount and losetup ignore seed and iteration. gpg key file
already includes seed and iteration because gpg program creates and writes
them there. IOW, gpg already does the right thing and protects the key file
against optimized dictionary attacks.

Single-key mode as used in loop-AES and mainline cryptoloop have nasty
exploitable weaknesses. I recommend that all new setups use more secure
multi-key mode. In multi-key mode you don't need to manually set seed and/or
iteration. You using seed and/or iteration, suggests that you are doing
something wrong.

I forgot to ask: What version of loop-AES are you using?

build-initrd.sh script from loop-AES versions older than v2.0e will not work
properly with recent gentoo glibc. In loop-AES-v2.0e you have to set
USEDIETLIBC=1. In loop-AES-v2.0f that is the default. vsyscall enabled glibc
incompatility with build-initrd.sh was one of the reasons why v2.0f was
released so quickly after v2.0e.

Also, are you sure that your mount and losetup programs are from
loop-AES-v2.0b or later? If they are older, multi-key mode will fail.

I am using loop-aes-v2.0f
the mount and losetup come from loop-aes


I ran the following command :
dd if=/dev/hda5 bs=64k | /mnt/root/aespipe -d -K /mnt/root/rootkey.gpg -G / | dd
of=/dev/hda5 bs=64k conv=notrunc

however when trying to mount /dev/hda5, mount doesn't recognize filesystem

I don't have access to my laptop right now, so can only provide exact error

Kernel 2.4.22 and later contains the crypto-API so you only need the
cryptoloop patch. 
have you tried the patches for .22 on .23? cryptoloop-jari [1] applies
with out any problems.

hi,

today i played around with some benchmarks i do from time to time [1]
this time with 2.4.24 and the cryptoloop patch
(patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0, applies to 2.4.24 too) when using this
machine (powerpc)

http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/2.4.24-benh/ver_linux

in short: i have a 700 MB file, losetup a loop device with a cipher
(aes,cast5,cast6,blowfish,serpent,twofish), create an ext3 fs on it.
then test with "tiobench" (size is only about 100MB). but the benchmarks
did not last very long, i have these messages in my syslog:

i am then able to sysrq-S, but not all partitions can be synced, then i
try sysrq-E / -I / -U with no luck, nothing seems to be written/read
to/from the disk, sysrq-B works :-)

i did manage to make earlier tests with different filesystems [2] and
linux 2.4.22 and have never had these messages.

Thanks for your hints,

Greetings!

I have created a system that runs on two encrypted partitions, ext3 and
swap, and it seems very interesting in our days of low hardware costs. 
Anyway, as I have been working with the systems some questions about the
daily running have arisen.  I hope this is an appropriate forum.  

What I am talking about is encrypting the root partition with loop-aes,
patching a kernel with loop-aes and replacing the utils necessary for
mounting them, like described in Christophe Devine's HOWTO
(http://howtos.linuxbroker.com/howtoreader.shtml?file=Encrypted-Root-Filesystem-HOWTO.html)
as a starting point.  In the future, I would also like to add a gpg
layer, like the one described in the loop-aes.README.

This far, these are my questions:

Journalling file systems.  Will it be safe to run journalling file
systems, or does one risk loss of data if the power is switched off,
etc, on an encrypted file system?  Is there a recommended filesystem at
all, or is the question itself irrelevant for such encryption?  Can
write cache be used?

Changing of passwords.  If one has a system of gpg keys and with
passwords contained in USB-dongles, one would like to enforce some
regime of password changing requirements on it.   It seems that just
checking the file dates vs. the hw clock would not be good enough, as it
can easily be changed, another thing I have thought of is having a
system with a counter stored on the dongle.  It might look like a using
a dongle with a trusted clock is the best option, but I'm hoping to find
out if this can be done through gpg directly or other smart ways.

Performance.  I would like to see some benchmarking of the performance
cost of an encrypted filesystem, so that I would know what to expect
from the hardware.  Is there any source out there for this?  In time the
system will be used for operation on very large files.

Suspend.  I read this in the announcement of the loop-AES-v2.0f
file/swap crypto package:

---
- Updated loop code to be compatible with Pavel Machek's software
suspend code (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
---

..but I didn't really understand if this means that it is "recommended"
or safe to use an encrypted version of software suspend now, or if this
is still hazardous.  I saw some notes of scepticism among linux kernel
developers.

Well let me close by saying bunches of thanks for much wonderful
software.  I hope my questions were adequately phrased and precise
enough.

Go with multi-key setup that is described in loop-AES' README. Old
single-key mode has exploitable weaknesses and should be avoided.

Device backed (partition backed) loops are ok with journaling file systems
at least when used with loop-AES. Mainline (current -bk version)
loop+cryptoloop combo is no longer journaling file system safe.

At least current version of loop-AES' mount does not support that. You have
to write your own scripts to do that. Depending how gpg encrypted key file
was set up, changing password is either re-encrypting key-file contents with
new password or changing gpg secret key password.

&gt; Suspend.  I read this in the announcement of the loop-AES-v2.0f
&gt; file/swap crypto package:
&gt; 
&gt; ---
&gt; - Updated loop code to be compatible with Pavel Machek's software
&gt; suspend code (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
&gt; ---
&gt; 
&gt; ..but I didn't really understand if this means that it is "recommended"
&gt; or safe to use an encrypted version of software suspend now, or if this
&gt; is still hazardous.  I saw some notes of scepticism among linux kernel
&gt; developers.

Here compatible means that unencrypted loop devices do not livelock during
suspend to disk. If there are encrypted loops active when suspending to
disk, encryption keys will get written to disk when kernel RAM is saved to
suspend partition, therefore completely voiding security of those keys.

&gt; &gt; Changing of passwords.  If one has a system of gpg keys and with

&gt; to write your own scripts to do that. Depending how gpg encrypted key file
&gt; was set up, changing password is either re-encrypting key-file contents with
&gt; new password or changing gpg secret key password.

Yes, I was prepared to do some scripting here, but my problem is that I
don't really see how I should best do this.  If the requirement is that
passwords expire after one year, how do I know if the password is a year
old?  Since the hardware clock can't be trusted, I'm looking into
hardware solution with own authorization or trusted clocks.  A counter
on the USB dongle could also just be reset, booting the encrypted system
with the old password.  Is there a good way to do this with gpg?

Mainline (current -bk version) loop no longer guarantees write ordering.
Journal commits may reach disk before file system modifications reach disk.
IOW, it is no longer crash proof.

loop-AES has always supported correct write ordering with device backed
loops, and will continue to do so.

Jari,

I forgot to ask for your comments on the approach on this site I found
on Google: http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.brisset/initrd-swsusp/ I guess
it's a pretty clear signal in the opposite direction if the Linux kernel
developers are against it, but as suspend obviously could be a useful
feature (making an encrypted system equal in use to a regular one), I'm
wondering if you think it could be done like this, or know of other
projects that will get us there in time?

&gt; i am then able to sysrq-S, but not all partitions can be synced, then i
&gt; try sysrq-E / -I / -U with no luck, nothing seems to be written/read

&gt;
&gt; i did manage to make earlier tests with different filesystems [2] and
&gt; linux 2.4.22 and have never had these messages.

Christian, Daniel,

Please do

echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/vm_gfp_debug

This will print additional information when the "%d-order allocation
failures" messages happen. Please post that information along with the
System.map for the running kernel.

Daniel is seeing a similar problem but running with RAID1 over loop (which
doesnt sound like a good idea to me - but should work anyway).

I suspect the problem is loop allocates its buffers in a way so that the
allocator can't sleep waiting for IO, which in turn overloads the memory
and causes the failures.

From: Thomas Thomas Jnr.
Madrid -  Spain
E-mail: TTHOMASSP55@NETSCAPE.NET 


TO  

Sir

This letter may come to you as a surprise because we have not met before but borne \
out of my sincere desire for assistance and to establish a business relationship with \
you, I   got  your contact from my late Fathers archieves, because he had contact \
with the International Trade and Commerce(I.T.C) and now that he is dead I believe \
you can be able to assist us invest this large sum of money we have in our \
possession.

My name is Mr Thomas Thomas Jnr. , my Father Mr Thomas Mbulu  was a memeber of the \
Zimbabwean  ruling council, he was killed in a coup plot by President Robert Mugabes \
body guards because he was against the siezure of the whitemans farmlands in \
Zimbabawe.

When my Father was alive, he handed over to me a certificate meant for a secret \
deposited trunk box which he made in a security company in Abidjan Cote D!Ivoire to \
Madrid, spain, he disclosed to me that the trunk box contains US$25MILLION  U.S \
DOLLARS. shortly after the death of my father , I and my brothers and sisters \
received series of intimidation and harassments from the hands of President Robert \
Mugabe. My fathers assets, companies  and accounts were seized by President Robert \
Mugabe  and converted to his personal use

With the pressure of intimidation and bad governance, I  travelled to madrid  spain \
under refugees status in search of a good friend to my late father who lives in the \
city,I arrived only to discorver that the man has relocated to somewhere else. it is \
for this reason we are contacting you, so sir you should kindly not feel embarrashed \
receiving this letter from us.

We have contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and have established \
ownership, but was disappointed as it is against section 22 of the refugees act of no \
130 of 1998 of the human right law which stipulates that asylum seekers will not be \
allowed to operate a bank account or to owe an enterprise,   We decided to solicit \
for your assistance in the withdrawal of the trunk box for investment purposes.

We cannot do it all alone due to our status and we are totally ignorant in business \
and investment,  you will be given 20% of total sum at the end of the transaction, if \
you are trustworthy and interested in the proposal, pls contact me via my e-mail \
immediately for more details,    you must maintain absolute confidentiality at all \
times to ensure success  because no other person knows that money contains in that \
box except me and like we are telling you now.

Things required from you are:
1.  To come to Madrid so that we can make arrangement to transfer the money to a safe \
account which you will provide. 2. To advise me on a viable sector where we can \
invest to make good use of the money.

It is important to note that during my fact finding mission to establish ownership of \
the subject matter I decided to write you, with all hope that you will not betray the \
trust I want to impose on you.

I expect your timely response

Regards

Mr Thomas Thomas Jnr.

From: Mrs Janet Michael

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
to Dr. Harry Michael who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast
 for nine years before he died in the year
2000.

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-
marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) 
with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. 

Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is 
my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to
donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual 
that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. 

I want a church that will use this fund to fund churches, orphanages
 and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. 
The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.

I took this decision because I don?t have any child that will inherit this 
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don?t want my husband´s 
hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t want a situation where this money
will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. 

I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my 
case and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communication in this regard because 
of my health and because of the presence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want
them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply 

I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland
. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original-
beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always
pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord 
must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. 

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church
or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping
to hearing from you.

N.B-

PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND 
IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE IS 
VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, 
THE LAWYER'S NAME IS ADVOCATEN VAN BOSCH,PHONE NUMBER 
IS 0031-620-794-311.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Mrs Janet Michael

Attention, 
Do not be perplexed with this note, It?s all about
soliciting your attention to transfer the Sum of {$20 USD},and
Will be transferred first, on a solid agreement and well done
as agreed by both parties the remaining sum (balance)of $20 Million
will be transferred accordingly as well. 
As an Auditor General (AG) an Equivalent of an American, Certified
Public Accountant {C.P.A} as well, a personal account officer to the Formal \
(Deseased), I believe that we can do this business without any Hitch, if only you \
will be trusted and then follow simple yielding Instructions for a sound smooth \
success of this Divine mercy(business), as I already had a Dream, of God's
presence and endorsement of this Transaction. 
We have marshaled out a solid master plan/arrangements
on how best to Actualize this laudable objective, so we are not trying to experiment \
with a transaction of this nature (MAGNITUDE), that will not/never ever come my way \
again in my life time. Our fears now is if this money will be safe in your \
hand/custody pending our phyiscal arrival for sharing, etc.  If we agree and never to \
disagree again, you will and to get 30%, 5% for the Orphanage, Poor/Less Privileged, \
5% for local and International expenses incurred by both parties on the course of \
transfer, while the balance of 60% will be for me and my partner. 
Note: The formal (deseased), died without Oral or
writing "WILL" and without any "HEIR", so the formal as a foreigner,
because he is a foreigner, this fund can not be
released or paid to an Indigene here, IT MUST BE A 
FOREIGNER WITH A VALID INTERNATIONAL PASS-PORT. So
based on this, that is the most reason why you are
contacted in regards, as you know INHERITANCE is 
not a crime all over the world, but will be crime only
when you did not follow the Rules, Laws and Procedures
of International Inheritance by making 
triple sure to secureing all the necessary transaction
documents to back up the said Inheritance, or other
wise. 
I got your contact from the Computer, You are the
first person in note of this transaction, on your
positive response, I will furnish you with
the FULL TRANSACTION DETAILS. 

Waiting for your positive response . 
Great regards, 
Mr.David Richards.

Hi -

I've been investigating doing encrypted backups to tape using afio and
gpg. Unfortunately this method proved to be extremely slow compared to
the standard backup (which was expected). Someone on the
debian-security list suggested looking at using a loop device such as
loop-aes that is connected to /dev/nst0 as this might be faster.

The only problem I can foresee with this is if there are media errors
on the tape. How does the loop device cope with this? afio manages to
deal with this sort of thing by spooling forward until the corrupt
data is passed over and a correct magic id can be found, but
presumably if the tape is encrypted a media error will lose the rest
of the tape... is this true?

Thanks

Marcus

hi,
I have an encrypted file system with kernel 2.4.20, I'm trying to open it
with 2.6.1 and util-linux 2.12,

after digging in some mailing lists I noticed you removed the password
hash functionality in losetup, so now I need to do:

hashprogram | losetup -e serpent-128 -p 0 /dev/loop0 myfile

now my question is: which program does the same hashing as losetup did and
where to get it?

is there some thing as a converting from previous to the new util-linux
howto?

thanks

AFAI understand CBC you loose the corrupted blocks + the one following
it, after that you should be OK.

(With CFB you loose everything after the corruption and CTB(?) shouldn't
even loose the block following the corruption.)


But i'm only an amateuer in crypto-things, so i may be wrong.

Can you change the block mode used on the loop device then?

Dont worry too much, me too! I can check up about the block modes in
my copy of appl crypt.

Following applies to both aespipe and loop-AES because they use same on-disk
format:

One bit ciphertext error causes the 16 byte block in which the error is to
be completely destroyed, plus one bit error in the next 16 byte block. The
one bit error in next block does not occour if wrong ciphertext bit happens
to be in last 16 bytes of 512 byte CBC chain. Also, in multi-key mode first
16 bytes of the 512 byte CBC chain are completely destroyed due to incorect
MD5 IV. In all cases the errors stay within same 512 byte block.

If compression is used (like in bz2aespipe script), then errors may
propagate to much larger set of data. Decompressors operate in GIGO mode,
garbage in - garbage out, and you may even get a bonus SIGSEGV if you are
lucky.

Ok. Thats what I needed to know.

So compress stuff before you put it on the loop presumably. We count
losing single files as fair risk over an unknown person potentially
having access to unencrypted backups.

Thanks for info,

Well, you should always compress before encrypting.  Encrypted data is
supposed to look fairly random, and hence should have extremely bad
compression ratios.  Perhaps Jari is referring to the fact that if
you're compressing, then the 16+ bytes that you lost of compressed
data, since it is compressed, represents maybe 32+ bytes of real data.

Hubert&gt; ...  Perhaps Jari is referring to the fact that if you're
Hubert&gt; compressing, then the 16+ bytes that you lost of compressed
Hubert&gt; data, since it is compressed, represents maybe 32+ bytes of real
Hubert&gt; data.

Sorry, That makes absolutely no sense.  I should avoid posting this
late at night.

Any errors in the underlying compressed data have the possibility of
cascading down and resulting in a whole lot more errors later in the
file.

I think that you had said (in the Debian list) that afio does per-file
compression, so if you want errors to be restricted to only within
single files, that's probably the best thing to do.

hashalot will do the same kind of hashing, if you use the "rmd160compat"
hash.

You'll also need some patches for util-linux so that it will work with
hashed passphrases and key sizes other than 256 bits. You can get these
and hashalot at &lt;URL:http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/&gt;.

PRIVATE AND URGENT.
Mr. Bruce Raymond.
32 Hyde Park Gate,
SW7 5DP, Amsterdam,
Netherlands.

Good day, 
I am contacting you because of a business concerning a huge sum of money from a \
deceased deposit in the Security and Finance company where I work here in \
Netherlands. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one \
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of \
the day. I actually decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.  
PROPOSITION;
I discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our foreign customers \
who died along with his entire family as a result of an automobile crash. He actually \
deposited this funds amounting to US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states \
dollars), for safe keeping in my company here in Amsterdam. Company file records \
shows that the funds was actually for a project our late costumer wanted to start in \
the near future (a multi million Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA), before his \
sudden and untimely death. As such since his death none of his relations or \
next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this property as the heir, this is the \
basically the reason why I have contacted you. My company cannot release the property \
unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in \
our operating guidelines. 

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to \
the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds \
to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you \
to know that I have secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of \
deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of \
our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;

1. Beneficiary full name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
3. Occupation and position
4. Nationality and Date of birth
5. Marital status

These requirements will enable me file letter of claim to the appropriate departments \
for necessary approvals in your favour before you can personally appear for the \
claim. I shall be compensating you with 30% of the total money while 10% will be for \
any expenses incurred the rest will be mine on final conclusion of this project. \
Please note that your share stays while the rest shall before me for investment \
purposes.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I \
have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. Please reply to my private and \
confidential email: bruceraymond3@indiatimes.com  
Best Regards,
Mr. Bruce Raymond.

Hey Guys, 
                          
I wanted to let you know about a deal I worked out for you with Speakeasy--the \
gracious host of the Fileshack and Shacknews network. They're ringing in the new year \
by putting together a pretty sweet offer on their DSL service that's custom built for \
online gamers. 

It's called the Fast, Cheap and Easy promotion, and it's exclusively for Fileshack \
members.  3.0/768 for a mere $69.95/month for the first three months. 
After that, pay just $99.95/month for this top-of-the-line package. 
And, best of all the Speakeasy Gamer package--which includes a premium Fileshack \
account--is included for free for the first year (a $120 value)! Check out all the \
details at: http://www.speakeasy.net/promos/fastcheapeasy/gamer

Just to give you an idea of what a great deal this is, the same Speakeasy package in \
2003 was $149/month. You'd be saving more than $678 in 2004 if you get it now.

Speakeasy has been a huge part of the Shack's success over the past year and there is \
no other broadband provider out there doing this much for the gaming community. They \
also do cool stuff like place file and multiplayer game servers inside their \
nationwide network to give gamers the best ping times possible. And since they don't \
have any lame restrictions on what you can/can't do with your connection, they are \
great for hosting your own servers, running BitTorrents and applications you want to \
use, or setting up a wireless network at home.

Check it out!

hi,

the more i read about it, the more i get interested in aes-loop &amp; the 
ciphers from loop-aes.sourceforge.net. but compiling the ciphers fails 
with lots of errors, as you can see here:

http://nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/ciphers/make.log

here's an excerpt:
---------
loop_twofish.c:869: error: `KERN_WARNING' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
loop_twofish.c:869: error: parse error before string constant
loop_twofish.c:872: error: `KERN_INFO' undeclared (first use in this 
function)

/usr/include/linux/device.h:364: error: storage size of `dev' isn't known
loop_twofish.c:834: error: storage size of `fish2_funcs' isn't known
---------

i did "make clean modules LINUX_SOURCE=...", where LINUX_SOURCE points 
to the kernel-source-dir of the 2.4.25-ben1 (benh) kernel. this is a ppc 
machine, gcc-3.3.3, make 3.8, binutils 2.14.90.0.7.

am i completely missing something? please tell me; any hints appreciated.

Thanks,

Here is a proposed solution to known plain text vulnerability.

Create and store a segment of random data equal in size to the data being encrypted.

XOR the user data with stored random data.

Encrypt both the random segment and the user data with conventional block cipher 
methods.

Since the user data was XORed with randomness, reminiscent of OTP. This would 
prevent usage of a precomputed dictionary against known plain text.

Obviously, users of this solution double their storage requirements.

Hi,

I'd like to change from kernel 2.4.20 cryptoloop encryption (AES)
to the latest greatest 2.6.x encryption. Is this process documented 
anywhere? Do I need an intermediate medium to store the unencrypted data?

Thanks,

Hello,

I'm using loop-aes  for quite a while now and have encounterd a small 
misfeature (I wouldn't call it a bug).
My box is running under debian woody. AfterI I build a new kernel (2.4.27) 
with, for example, "make-kpkg --append-to-version \-test kernel_image" and 
installing it I have the directory /lib/modules/2.4.27-test/.
After rebooting and selecting the nee kernel in grub, I change now to my 
loop-aes directory and execute make, /usr/src/linux points to the running 
kernel, he compiles the new loop.o modul but moves it 
to  /lib/modules/2.4.27/block/  instead of the right 
place /lib/modules/2.4.27-test/block/ . The Makefile also complains about the 
wrong version ("WARNING - THIS MODULE WILL NOT WORK WITH CURRENTLY RUNNING 
KERNEL") but infact I'm running the right kernel.
Of course I only have to move the module to the right place, but I think it's 
quite annyoing.

Thanks
Thomas Braun

yes, i've heard about this issue but i need to read on to get your point.

&gt; At least when you get it back you only have to recreate your boot partition
&gt; from a trusted backup and trust the server again.

yes, one yould just re-image the hd with the trusted backup and it
probably saves install time.

i fail to parse your message here and hence fail to understand why it
should be necessary to encrypt the _operating system_ part of the hd:

&gt; Or let some judicial review
&gt; and due process take place before handing over the keys (if you have a choice

handing over the keys for /usr/lib? sure, i'd hand them out ;-)

&gt; and are not in some gulag as is so common with our _in_justice system these
&gt; days). Also, if only the client had the keys, then it would leave the ISP out
&gt; of the loop.

i doubt the ISP would be asked to make a copy of /sbin for the feds.

&gt; And again, it would be possible to create a server with
&gt; ephemeral keys so that the data and the server is completely lost if powered

how is losing /etc going to help here? we have to set it up all again when
we get back the server. remember, i'm not speaking about *data* parts
here. losing parts of sensitive data (making it unrecoverable with
ephemeral keys could make sense if the worst case happens). i was speaking
about the *operating system* part.

&gt; I have not had time to work out this configuration with ssh yet. I think a
&gt; better solution is to offer remote console access via blade servers for
&gt; example, so that the client can have full control of the entire process
&gt; remotely and be completely responsible for the server at all times. Anyone on
&gt; this list interested in such a dedicated server solution? (In other words can
&gt; I get some 10 interested people so that it becomes a business proposition?)

already offered by many hosters.

thanks,
Christian.

hi list,

i'm using loop-aes for quite a while now and from time to time i had to
remount device-backed loop-aes partitions. eg. a normally r/o mounted
backup partition would become a r/w. i did this like so:

$ mount -o remount,rw /data

when i try this now, mount comes back with

mount: block device /dev/hda1 is write-protected, mounting read-only

i don't know exactly when it stopped working (but i'm pretty sure it
worked a month ago or so). upgrading to the latest loop-aes/ciphers
package did not help.

my setup:

root@sheep:~# losetup -a
/dev/loop5: [0805]:173 (/dev/hda1) encryption=twofish128 multi-key read-only
/dev/loop6: [0805]:380 (/dev/sda8) encryption=AES128 multi-key
/dev/loop7: [0805]:389 (/dev/sdb1) encryption=twofish128 multi-key read-only

root@sheep:~# uname -r
2.6.10-rc2-bk9

root@sheep:~# mount -V
mount: mount-2.12a      &lt;--- stock debian util-linux

i mount the partition with

- -o ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev,noatime,loop=/dev/loop7,\
   gpgkey=/root/keys/sdb1.gpg,encryption=twofish128

(or encryption=aes128 for the aes partition)

fwiw, i've attached the (E)rrors shown from an strace during mount.

thank you for comments,
Christian.

When loop was set up, it was set up in "hard" read-only mode, IOW, loop
driver would not permit any writes to reach underlying device. rw mount is
doomed to fail on such read-only loop device. Loop code in loop-AES has
worked like that for long time, years IIRC. OTOH, if VFS is now opening
about-to-rw-mount devices without FMODE_WRITE set, then something is broken
in VFS.

The fix is to do the initial loop mount rw, or to set up loop using losetup
but no -r option passed losetup.

you could edit /usr/src/linux/Makefile, or let make-kpkg edit this file

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm using loop-aes  for quite a while now and have encounterd a small
&gt; &gt; misfeature (I wouldn't call it a bug).
&gt; &gt; My box is running under debian woody. AfterI I build a new kernel
&gt; (2.4.27)
&gt; &gt; with, for example, "make-kpkg --append-to-version \-test kernel_image"
&gt; and
&gt; make-kpkg is a debian feature....

Yeah of course, see my mail as a feature request :-)
&gt; &gt; installing it I have the directory /lib/modules/2.4.27-test/.
&gt; &gt; After rebooting and selecting the nee kernel in grub, I change now to my
&gt; &gt; loop-aes directory and execute make, /usr/src/linux points to the running
&gt; &gt; kernel, he compiles the new loop.o modul but moves it
&gt; &gt; to  /lib/modules/2.4.27/block/  instead of the right
&gt; &gt; place /lib/modules/2.4.27-test/block/ .
&gt;
&gt; ...and as such, it's basically make+some_debian_magic. but the Makefile
&gt; from loop-aes (or some other src) does not know about the "magic" part.
&gt; i assume it will only look into /usr/src/linux/Makefile and finds 2.4.27
&gt;  as version number.

After compiling an kernel with make-kpkg  the file include/linux/version.h has 
the following content:
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.4.27-wgserver1"
#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132123
#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) &lt;&lt; 16) + ((b) &lt;&lt; 8) + (c))

In a plain vanilla kernel dir after executing "make dep" the file has
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.4.27"
#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132123
#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) &lt;&lt; 16) + ((b) &lt;&lt; 8) + (c))

So perhaps it would be better to get the kernel version from this file instead 
of the Makefile ?!

&gt; &gt; The Makefile also complains about the
&gt; &gt; wrong version ("WARNING - THIS MODULE WILL NOT WORK WITH CURRENTLY
&gt;
&gt; RUNNING
&gt;
&gt; &gt; KERNEL") but infact I'm running the right kernel.
&gt;
&gt; you're running 2.4.27-test, and the "-test" was added to the kernel, not
&gt; to /usr/src/linux/Makefile, right? not? correct me, if i'm wrong.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course I only have to move the module to the right place, but I
&gt;
&gt; think it's
&gt;
&gt; &gt; quite annyoing.
&gt;
&gt; you could edit /usr/src/linux/Makefile, or let make-kpkg edit this file
&gt; perhaps?

OK the first is the shortes hack, but uncomfortable. And AFAIK make-kpkg 
doesn't edit the Makefile.
See also 
http://www.svce.ac.in/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/share/man/man1/make-kpkg.1.gz
for an explanation of --append-to-version.

You can override kernel's KERNELRELEASE Makefile string by defining it on
loop-AES make command line. Something like this:

make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux KERNELRELEASE=2.4.27-test

Oh, I forgot to say this: "make modules" is the wrong syntax there. Plain
"make" or "make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux-2.4.25-ben1" are correct.

oh, i'm really sorry. when i wrote "LINUX_SOURCE=.." i actually meant
"LINUX_SOURCE=(and so on, you know, the path to the kernel source, 
specified as in the README file)". so i really did run this command, now 
in full length (it wraps the line!)

evil@sheep:~$ make clean modules 
LINUX_SOURCE=/data/MP3/scratch/kernel/linux-2.4-benh-RSYNC/

(yes, the path is pretty strange being under "../MP3", but i have some 
problems with disk space atm.)

so after running the commands above i got the error messages i told about.

Thanks for the quick reply and sorry again for the confusion,
Christian.

 &gt; Did my make example fix your problem?

hm, i did:

make modules LINUX_SOURCE=/data/MP3/scratch/kernel/linux-2.4-benh-RSYNC/

and then i get the compile errors.
oh, now i tried again and did:

make LINUX_SOURCE=/data/MP3/scratch/kernel/linux-2.4-benh-RSYNC/

(notice the lacking "modules" argument) --&gt; now it compiles, just
have ignore the errors (make -i), when it tries to install the modules.

Thanks and sorry for the noise,

Hello,

I'm at step 14 of Jari's HOWTO (Section "7.6. Example 6 - Boot from 
CD-ROM + encrypted root partition").

Before encrypting my data with the rescue CD, I wanted to test the CD 
burned at step 13e. However, I get a kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount 
root fs on ram0.

Is this an expected error since nothing is encrypted yet?

How can I make sure that the CD will work after my data is encrypted?

Thanks,

Christian

oh, you're so right Jari. yes, i started to mount the partitions with "ro"
in the first place. i.e. the system boots, "ro" is set in fstab, the loop
device gets setup in "ro" mode and could only be changed when i unmount /
then mount again in "rw" mode. *then* i can use -o remount,rw and -o
remount,ro whenever i like. the inital losetup (done by mount, i guess) is
to "blame" here.

&gt; worked like that for long time, years IIRC. OTOH, if VFS is now opening
&gt; about-to-rw-mount devices without FMODE_WRITE set, then something is
&gt; broken in VFS.

i don't know if that's the case here. i know how to workaround the issue,
but perhaps i should (wishlist)bug the util-linux people here?

thanks for the (always) quick reply,
Christian.

Hello,



JR&gt; Looks like the kernel sources in /home/bstaron/linux-2.6.8.1/ are not ready
JR&gt; for module compiling.

JR&gt; The fix is to recompile and install new kernel in that kernel source
JR&gt; directory and then compile a new loop module for for that new kernel.
JR&gt; Something like this:


Great. Everything works again :)
However, one question remains. In the current readme this part:
===================================================================
In multi-key loop cases "losetup -a" command run by root user should
output "multi-key-v3" indicating that loop is really in multi-key-v3
mode. If no "multi-key-v3" string shows up, your loop setup is a time
bomb.
===================================================================

Well, I did a complete install, also util-linux as described in the
readme. After everything was installed and reboot and mount I see this:

linux:/home/bstaron# losetup -a
/dev/loop3: [0305]:684215 (/dev/hda7) encryption=AES128 multi-key-v2

This is of course created with one of the 2.2 versions of loop-aes.
It seems it's normal for an old keyfile. I created a new keyfile and partition
with v3 and it shows multi key v3.

Yes, that is normal for version 2 on-disk format.

&gt; From Miss Onome Obi

email:onomeobi78@netscape.net



Dear friend,

How are you doing today? 

I hope fine. if so glory be to God. my names is Onome obi 25yrs and I am the daughter \
to the late former minister of agriculture in Nigeria. my dad died since last years \
in a ghastly plane crash on his way back from Kenya, and since then life has not been \
easy for me and my family 

anyway i thank God that i am alive today. 



Since the death of my dad things have not been easy with us. Though my dad died \
leaving a huge amount of funds and the government has refused to release this money \
because the money has been lodged in foreign account. I and my family have gone \
through hell even my dadsbrothers could not help us and the only given option now for \
us to have a reliable foreigner that can assist us with his/her foreign account so \
that the funds can be transferred into his or her account. After this has been done \
my family and I are willing to offer 25% of the funds to anyone that can assist us so \
that we can claim our money. 



My mum has been so ill and things are not really going well with us here. I decided \
to contact you because i knew God was gong to use you to assist me and my family from \
our present predicament.As soon as we have been able to collect this money I and my \
family will be coming 

overseas so we can start up a new life and invest in a profitable business venture i \
will be glad if you can assist. There is nothing to fear about as i have attached my \
pics for proper identification as i write this I write in tears and pains, I appeal \
to you to assist me so that the funds can be transfer I will give u more details as \
soon as hear from you. 



I want you to know that i have been directed by the spirit to send this to you, may \
the lord bless you richly as you assist my family and me in regaining our lost life \
back as this is my mum's only wish right now? and do please reply me with this email \
address: 

onomeobi78@netscape.net



Best regards



Miss Onome obi.

&gt; 
&gt; I skipped the third step and directly tried the fourth
&gt; one and the message disappeared. However, I do not
&gt; really understand why. This option does not seem to be
&gt; in the README. I also noticed that the module was not
&gt; automatically intalled as usual, but stayed in the tmp
&gt; directory that the make process created.

This problem is caused by CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y in your kernel config. ~ The

USE_KBUILD=y make command line parameter partially works around this problem
and patch below also changes Makefile to partially work around this problem.

Best fix is to disable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS in kernel config. This is because
currently on 2.6 kernels module symbol versions only work for symbols that
are present in the main kernel source tree. When externally compiled loop
module exports symbols to other externally compiled loop cipher modules,
those exported symbols don't have proper versions and modprobe program from
module-init-tools package is not happy with that kind of symbols. This is
small regression in module-init-tools vs. modutils that were used on 2.4 and
older kernels.

No, of course not. Just a simple "ghosted image" of the entire drive, or the

Great! Loop-AES friendly? Remote "virtual cdrom" or PXE boot? With some nice 
HOWTOs? Where can one sign up?

Cheers!

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Added new improved version 3 on-disk format that includes one separate key
  for MD5 IV computation. This fixes a weakness in IV computation that
  normally is not exploitable.
- Fixed a bug that caused key file decrypt failure when gpg home directory
  was on read-only mounted file system. This bug affected encrypted root
  partition usage and is present only in losetup+mount from loop-AES-v2.2c
  and loop-AES-v2.2d versions.

Hello Jari,

&gt; I found the cause of this problem. Util-linux patches in loop-AES-v2.2c 
&gt; and

I applied the patch and now it works.

Thank you for your help.

Hello,

I tried checking out the new version, but I can't compile it, like the
last time. I have no idea what's wrong, I tried following this guide:
http://www.meindlsoft.de/doc.php?kb_id=304

Ok, my system:
linux:/home/bstaron/loop-AES-v3.0a# uname -a
Linux linux 2.6.8-1-686 #1 Thu Nov 25 04:34:30 UTC 2004 i686 GNU/Linux

I downloaded and unpacked this source:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.8.1.tar.bz2

Then:
linux:/home/bstaron/loop-AES-v3.0a# make LINUX_SOURCE=/home/bstaron/linux-2.6.8.1

Then it gives me pages after pages of errors. I don't know if I should
send this to the list, I guess not.... it's 25kb zipped.

The last couple of lines:

&gt; From Miss Onome Obi

email:onomeobi78@netscape.net



Dear friend,

How are you doing today? 

I hope fine. if so glory be to God. my names is Onome obi 25yrs and I am the daughter \
to the late former minister of agriculture in Nigeria. my dad died since last years \
in a ghastly plane crash on his way back from Kenya, and since then life has not been \
easy for me and my family 

anyway i thank God that i am alive today. 



Since the death of my dad things have not been easy with us. Though my dad died \
leaving a huge amount of funds and the government has refused to release this money \
because the money has been lodged in foreign account. I and my family have gone \
through hell even my dadsbrothers could not help us and the only given option now for \
us to have a reliable foreigner that can assist us with his/her foreign account so \
that the funds can be transferred into his or her account. After this has been done \
my family and I are willing to offer 25% of the funds to anyone that can assist us so \
that we can claim our money. 



My mum has been so ill and things are not really going well with us here. I decided \
to contact you because i knew God was gong to use you to assist me and my family from \
our present predicament.As soon as we have been able to collect this money I and my \
family will be coming 

overseas so we can start up a new life and invest in a profitable business venture i \
will be glad if you can assist. There is nothing to fear about as i have attached my \
pics for proper identification as i write this I write in tears and pains, I appeal \
to you to assist me so that the funds can be transfer I will give u more details as \
soon as hear from you. 



I want you to know that i have been directed by the spirit to send this to you, may \
the lord bless you richly as you assist my family and me in regaining our lost life \
back as this is my mum's only wish right now? and do please reply me with this email \
address: 

onomeobi78@netscape.net



Best regards



Miss Onome obi.

Hello Houston,

i have a problem :-)

I want to set up my linux box with root filesystem encryption using the gpg
multi key method with aes256.cipher and this does not work.

I build everything as described in the readme file, encrypted swap works and
i can make a gpg keyfile and use these keys for a aes256 encrypted
partition. There are no problems with this so i think my setup is correct. I
can boot my rescue system and use dd, aespipe and gpg to encrypt my root
partition, this also works. To do this i have to use my gpg key repository
and enter my password. So i think my password, the keyfile and gpg should be
ok. If i try to boot the encrypted system and enter the password when asked
i get the message "Error: gpg key file decryption failed" I tried this
several times with different keyfiles/passwords, compiled and set up
everything again, it does not work. GRMPFT!

What could be wrong?

I use debian sarge, kernel 2.6.9, loop-aes 2.2d, aes-pipe 2.2e, util-linux
2.12h, dietlibc 0.27, gnupg 1.2.6.

Are you using a password that has different encodings in UTF-8 and 8859-1?

Are you sure that keyboard key mappings are set the same? If I remember
correctly .de keyboards use transposed locations for Z and Y characters
versus default United States key locations.

Just to check that gpg is statically linked, can you also provide output of
"ldd /bin/gpg /usr/bin/gpg /boot/gpg" command?

Hello Jari,

&gt; &gt; Are you using a password that has different encodings in UTF-8 and
8859-1?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are you sure that keyboard key mappings are set the same? If I remember
&gt; &gt; correctly .de keyboards use transposed locations for Z and Y characters
&gt; &gt; versus default United States key locations.

The password consists of characters [a..z], [A..Z], [0..9], no z, no y, no
special characters.

&gt; Just to check that gpg is statically linked, can you also provide output
of
&gt; "ldd /bin/gpg /usr/bin/gpg /boot/gpg" command?

Yes. :-)

Sometimes its better to think first :-) This should be [a..x], [A..X],
[0..9].

Ok. Can you provide output of "ls -l /boot" command and build-initrd.sh
configuration data (the FOO=abc parts at the beginning of the
build-initrd.sh file or a separate config file).

To get more info why gpg fails, can you apply attached patch to util-linux
and recompile new mount+losetup programs and copy new losetup to /boot
directory?

Above "cannot open `/dev/tty´: No such device or address" is the cause of
this failure. /dev/tty device node is created inside the initrd by
build-initrd.sh line 700, but for some reason your kernel does not have
support for that device built in.

Can you provide output of "ls -l /dev/tty" command and your kernel config
(bzip2 compressed preferred)?

Are you using udev created /dev/* names? Any chance of disabling udev?

&gt; Error: gpg key file decryption failed
&gt; Command "/lib/losetup -e AES256   -I 0 -K /lib/rootkey.gpg -G /lib
&gt; /dev/loop0 /dev/hda7" returned error

These errors are caused by above /dev/tty open failure.

Sorry but i have never heared something about this udev thing. ??? Seems i
have to google a little bit before i can answer your question but i think
(ok, i am not 100% shure) the device nodes are created with mknod.

Now i know more about it. Thank you google :-)

udev is not installed on my system and so it can not dynamically create any
device nodes.

Hi !

I am new to loop-aes and an advanced linux user - guess what that means.

I am using Mandrake Linux v10.0 Official with a new customly compiled 
kernel Ver. 2.6.8. Block Device "Loop" is deactivated in .config.

I downloaded
a) util-linux-2.12a
b) aes-loop-2.0g

I chose old Package Versions, because the version of the util-linux 
package matches the util-linux patch shipped with aes-loop-2.0g 
(util-linux-2.12a.diff) correctly.

Compiling (a) works fine, but doing "make" in the base dir of (b) fails.

Work Dir (pwd):
    loop-aes-2.12a

Command a)
make
Ouput:
---
cd /lib/modules/2.6.8/build &amp;&amp; make 
SUBDIRS=/root/download/loop-AES-v2.0g modules Q='@cd 
/root/download/loop-AES-v2.0g &amp;&amp; if [ "$@" = 
"/root/download/loop-AES-v2.0g" ]; then make modules; fi; # '
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.8'
   Building modules, stage 2.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.8'
---
Command b)

I have successfully used cryptoloop in single-key mode before. My goal 
is to use aes-loop in multi-key loop as comfortably and verbosly 
described in the README file of aes-loop.

I would be pleased if someone could give me a hint how to fix the 
Makefile appropriately, however I consider it to be valid and complete 
or instruct me what parameters to pass to make to compile aes-loop 
successfully.

hello
any idea how to burn 4.2G encrypted ext2fs image on
DVD ? like 
"cdrecord dev=0,0,0 -v -data image.ext2" with 700M
cdrom.
i have cdrtools-2.00 &amp; dvd+rw-tools-5.19
is not possible with growisofs ? or other ?

thanx :)

Just as you said.

Only that you need the (binary) ProDVD-Version of cdrecord.

I have an old encrypted file with a .cpt extension.  I created this file
using an old version of SuSE if memory serves.  I am trying to figure

decrypt using all known algorithms and perhaps show the first few lines
from the decrypted file (so I can determine if one looks like a gz file

I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed at this point, of if I can
forget getting the data contained in this file back.

Michael, you didn't do anything wrong. It was *me* who goofed.

I found the cause of this problem. Util-linux patches in loop-AES-v2.2c and
loop-AES-v2.2d have a bug. Earlier loop-AES versions are not affected.
Problem is that when gpg home directory is on read-only mounted file system
and gpg is unable to create lock files for keyring files there, gpg
considers that an error severe enough to return nonzero exit status. Mount
and losetup programs from loop-AES-v2.2c and loop-AES-v2.2d include gpg exit
status check and that of course fails. The fix is to remove that check and
ignore gpg exit value. Below is a patch for loop-AES-v2.2d util-linux patch.
Same patch is also available from http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/updates/

So why didn't I catch this bug? Because my encrypted root test setup used
losetup binary that was compled in February 2004, and as such it lacked this
gpg exit value test bug. My fault, sorry.

Looks like the kernel sources in /home/bstaron/linux-2.6.8.1/ are not ready
for module compiling.

The fix is to recompile and install new kernel in that kernel source
directory and then compile a new loop module for for that new kernel.
Something like this:

    cd /home/bstaron/linux-2.6.8.1/
    mv .config z
    make distclean
    mv z .config
    make oldconfig
    make dep &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make bzImage
    make modules &amp;&amp; make modules_install
    cat arch/i386/boot/bzImage &gt;/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8.1
    cp System.map /boot/System.map-2.6.8.1

    cd /home/bstaron/loop-AES-v3.0a
    make LINUX_SOURCE=/home/bstaron/linux-2.6.8.1

Then configure bootloader to boot new kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8.1
Then boot to new kernel.

You can use losetup/mount/swapon from util-linux-2.12a with loop.ko from

This Makefile incompatibility should be fixed in loop-AES-v2.2b

Watches, clocks and alarm clocks manufactured in Switzerland bear the designation \
-Swiss made- (or its abbreviation "Swiss") as well as the logo of the producer or \
distributor. This label enjoys a solid reputation throughout the world.

What lies behind this reputation
What does a label like this mean for the consumer

"Swiss made" embodies a concept of quality that has been forged over the years. It \
includes the technical quality of watches (accuracy, reliability, water-resistance \
and shock-resistance), as well as their aesthetic quality (elegance and originality \
of design). It covers both traditional manufacturing and new technologies \
(micro-electronics).

The Swiss are not the only watchmakers to manufacture high-quality timepieces and are \
consequently faced with strong competition. However, thanks to their unique \
infrastructure and to their know-how and spirit of innovation, they have succeeded in \
maintaining their leading position.

The intrinsic value of the "Swiss made" label, therefore, is the result of \
considerable efforts on the part of watchmaking companies, who are ultimately \
responsible for maintaining its reputation.

well, googling for "encrypt .cpt" reveals, that there is a program called
"ccrypt" which is ncrypting files and adding .cpt to the filename:

the plaintext, i.e. the "gz" contents should only be available when you
have the correct passphrase though...that's why it's encrypted ;-)

This is an old thread, but I found the mailing list on (cryptoapi) 
linux crypto development:
http://lists.logix.cz/mailman/listinfo/cryptoapi

Recent discussions focused on more use of sysfs for core linux drivers, 
etc. Developers-only, I presume.

Even at this late date, I am not certain how the cryptoapi discussed on 
that mailing list relates to mainline kernel development. It seems to 
be the modern equivalent of kerneli.org work.

It might not be that mainline soon:

&lt;URL:http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3521&gt;

I don't know if something has happened since, but it seems that at least 
2.6.9pre4 doesn't yet remove cryptoloop.

PPDD depends on cryptoloop, so it might break again soon. X) Quick (and 
possibly dirty) solution would be to kick cryptoloop back, and provide a 
patch as for 2.4 series.

I think PPDD does fairly well what it should do. Most of the stuff, like 
key management, are tightly integrated. This is a problem if it doesn't 
offer exactly what you want, and at least then loop-AES is a better choice.

The solutions currently in kernel, like cryptoloop, don't seem secure 
enough for many uses. Try searching Google for e.g. "cryptoloop security 
weaknesses". I guess Jari has said something about security regarding 
cryptoloop etc.:

&lt;URL:http://v4.livegate.net/wipe/&gt;

&gt; I experimented with crypto-loop using blowfish or twofish, and it seems 
&gt; quite stable for device-backed loops. Jari Ruusu has raised concerns 
&gt; about encryption key re-use with it, so I'm trying loop-aes now...
&gt; 
&gt; A short description of how PPDD is different would be interesting!

You'll find something from the above URL. More specific description on 
how PPDD works can be found in Allan Latham's original PPDD package.

Hi there...I am looking for a simple tool which I can use to encrypt and compress a \
file and decompress and decrypt a file in Linux.

I can use command line gpg and compress/gzip for it but my decryption/decompression \
requirement is that I need to read the encrypted/compressed file from a ROM and print \
its contents into console without creating any temporary files. Basically, I don;t \
have write permission to the system....i can only read from it and print into the \
console. 

So, I need a kind of simple C/C++ API which I can use to (de/en)crypt and \
(un/)compress byte/char streams. 

Can anybody share any of his experiances regarding this?

Thanks,
Arijit

i parse your mail as "you want to know how to set up an encrypted root 
filesystem NOT using loop-aes but cryptoloop" - right?

well, the "official" cryptoloop howto from tldp.org is in revision 1.2. 
an older version of this howto (v1.1) is available here:

http://www.frech.ch/howto/HOWTO/html_single/Cryptoloop-HOWTO/

and it says in chapter 2:

"Loop-AES offers some additional features that are not yet present in 
the kernel implementation of Cryptoloop. If you want to encrypt the root 
and swap partitions, you may want to stick with Loop-AES for now."

i don't know why it was deleted from current versions of the howto.

i assume (!) you can take the loop-aes encrypted rootfs howto as a 
basis. you'll probably have to create an initrd for cryptoloop too, 
which will be present unencrypted and then (during bootup) will 
pivot_root to the real (encrypted) rootfs.

Mr. Daniel Harvey:

Referencing your comments of 18 OCT 2004, I comment as follows:

Based on your argument, is it presumable that using a journaling filesystem
on a file backed loop device (even if you are not using loop-aes, or any
encryption mechanism) can be quite a dangerous, correct?

By the way at the bottom of your comments, you say "PS. Kernel 2.6", does
that mean that the issue you speak of does not apply in Kernel 2.6 as it has
been remediated in that kernel version?

You get secretfile.txt.gz.gpg

On the other box use, e.g.

Or if you first encrypt and then compress (you first did (2) and then (1)):

$ gunzip -c secretfile.txt.gpg.gz | gpg --decrypt | less

Hello,

has anyone successfully encrypted a server, like in example
7.5.  Example 5 - Encrypting root partition?

It would mean that the server boots up, then somehow waits for the
password to open the GPG keyfile.

Then you connect, for example, by SSH, you see a prompt, enter
the password and the server boots through.

Would be nice to know if anyone was successful doing that. Reason for
that would be, Server is in a server center somewhere, hard to reach.

Greetings,

well, I'm looking for a way to encrypt my files, filesystem - surprised, ain't 
yeh?  ;-) But I'm getting a little bit confused by the offer.
Due to google a found a lot of ways to perform this task

- GnuPG
- aes-pipe
- aes-loop
- standard linux crypto loopback device
- Encryption using the device mapper
- ppdd loop device
- (.. some I have not found yet, but afaik there was an approach patching nfs 
or something like that)

I hope nobody blame me for being a little bit confused right know ;-)
Due to google, I found how to set up every single utility, but I haven't found 
any site comparing theses approaches, analysing 'em (from a scientific point 
of view) and give some advice for newbies.

I've been  using gpg for mail and backup encryption for years, It tend to be 
very useful, and because of using userland programs only, it is very portable 
and ideal for backups or mails I may want to decrypt on othersystems.
I used it from a very naive point of view not thinking of security in detail, 
(like multiple keys for block-device encryption).

Now the situation has changed. I purchased a laptop and want to encrypt my 
home for security reasons. (I don't want a thief or a competitor be able to 
read it). So I need I very secure filesystem encryption and aes-loop, ppdd 
and device-mapper encryption draw my attention. Due to requiring  modules / 
kernelcode and a patched util-linux it seem to be impossible to use more than 
one at the same time. (Without rebooting the system)
On the other hand I want to use some mountable encryption for portable storage 
devices as well. For instance I have a USB-Stick /DVD-RAM /-RW with some 
enclosed data I want to access on different systems.  (All systems are 
considered to be trusted).  The data should be able to be accessed form 
userland as well as kernelland based tools. I want to be able to mount it on 
some systems - on other systems userland access is necessary because I cannot 
use the kernel I want. Being able to gain access to my data with OpenBSD, 
Solaris or MacOS would also be nice. 
On the one hand, aes-pipe seems to be a perfect approach for this task, but on 
the other hand, I don't know which features of  loop-aes (like multiple keys) 
are implemented in aes-pipe, too.
So, can you show me a way out of this jungle?

Keep smiling
yanosz

Hi,

I am using loop-AES for over a year now (for some
weeks even with encrypted root partition). It's
perfect! Well, I recently discovered that the kernel
gives a warning about getting tainted when I load the
loop module:

loop: no version for "struct_module" found: kernel
tainted.

I cannot remember that this message has been there
before. Since it is obviously free, open source
software, the message should not be necessary, right?
How to get rid of it? Or did I possibly select some
wrong option in my new kernel configuration?

Thomas

&gt; 4) Try appending USE_KBUILD=y to make command line
&gt; that you used to build

I skipped the third step and directly tried the fourth
one and the message disappeared. However, I do not
really understand why. This option does not seem to be
in the README. I also noticed that the module was not
automatically intalled as usual, but stayed in the tmp
directory that the make process created.

Anyway - thanks for your help!

don't know about these OSes, but in order to work loop-aes requires that
kernel loopback support is turned off. with that being so, loop-aes is
ideal for such cases.

Ok, this sounds reasonable.

Well, ok.
The URL is about loop-aes &lt;-&gt; vs. mainline kernel comcept. What about ppdd vs 
loop-aes?
Correct me, if wrong, but multiple keys are not necessary in non-blockwise 
modes?
If you think of bigger tar archives (1,5 GB - 4GB), are multiple-keys 
encryption also necessary there?
Furthermore: If you have n keys. Is there an max amount ma(n) of data, which 
can be considered to be save? (What is ma(n))?

Well, furthermore, too, what exactly is the relationship between loop-aes and 
aespipe? Can I safely encrypt / decrypt everthing with aespipe in userland I 
want to use / used with aes-loop or are there any restrictions?

The mainline crypto (dm-crypt only--cryptoloop will be depreciated very
soon) is _starting_ to address some of the issues Jari Ruusu has been
mentioning.  At this point, if you want to make sure you are relatively
secure, use loop-AES in multi-key mode.

(As for speed, don't think about it. The more secure modes of loop-AES
and mainline crypto both have some performance penalties over their less
secure modes*, even though both have an assembly-optimized version of
AES on x86 architectures available to all modes.)

*E.g. loop-AES multi-key versus single-key mode, and dm-crypt (mainline
crypto ) ESSIV and Plumb IV hashing (both are relatively new to
mainline) versus Plain IV hashing.

&gt; Being able to gain access to my data with OpenBSD, 
Solaris or MacOS would also be nice. 

Using GnuPG to encrypt individual files seems to be the most
cross-platform solution for portable media (as it even works on Windows
with no problems).  For x86-platform boxes, Knoppix CD's usually have
current implementations of loop-AES (and, months ago, there was talk of
including dm-crypt).

aespipe is userland program that lets you encrypt and decrypt file system
images on any unix like operating system.

&gt; On the one hand, aes-pipe seems to be a perfect approach for this task, but on
&gt; the other hand, I don't know which features of  loop-aes (like multiple keys)
&gt; are implemented in aes-pipe, too.

aespipe supports multi-key mode.

&gt; Well, furthermore, too, what exactly is the relationship between loop-aes and
&gt; aespipe?

Both were written by same author, me. They are compatible with each other.

Yes.

&gt; or are there any restrictions?

No.

Herring is tweakable block cipher designed by Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen.

That page begins with "First of all, the reason for the existence of this

It never was FUD.

Now even Mr. Clemens Fruhwirth seems to understand that, but above quoted

Sounds nice ;)
Just two topics are still uncovered. 
1st. Encrypting tar-archives (backups). I'm currently using gpg (with twofish) 
to do that task. Is multiple-key encryption also necessary there? Due to the 
structure, known plaintext-attacks are possible. And what about avi-files? 
They have a block-structure as well....  If so, how should I use aes-pipe in 
order to do so?

2nd. 
Is there a max amount of data (limit) which can be encrypted safely?

again, which scheme? 

if you plan to backup your data on dvd, using loop-aes to encrypt the
whole filesystem, you have to use loop-aes in multiple key mode
because the single key mode is weak

I would use gpg for that, in combination with rar. rar's recovery
record feature has save my life multiple times so far.


&gt; Furthermore: If you have n keys. Is there an max amount ma(n) of data, which 
&gt; can be considered to be save? (What is ma(n))?

loop-aes, set up in multiple key mode? I know of no limit

it's a tweakable block cipher

last time I heard of the cipher it was soon to be published, but that
was in February 2004. AFAIK the cipher doesn't suffer the weaknesses
of the mainline kernel crypto stuff. I don't know any recent news
about it, and last time I contacted the author I got no reply. It
seems he's quite busy.

why the chaos with cryptoloop? first, it's not included in vanilla
2.4.x kernels, it's patch work, then it is included in vanilla 2.6
kernels and soon: big ?

any news on what scheme is going to be cryptoloop's successor?

seems you know more about it, could you shed some light on this?

No.

gpg implements good strong crypto. If you are happy with it, why change it?

&gt; 2nd.
&gt; Is there a max amount of data (limit) which can be encrypted safely?

64 bit block size ciphers risk accidentally outputting identical ciphertexts
with relatively small amounts of data, but 128 bit block size ciphers don't
have that problem.

Twofish has 128 bit block size, so you don't need to worry about that.

what's the point in encrypting the root partition anyway? i know, this
issue comes up every now and then but i for one don't give a *** about my
root-partition. /bin, /usr and /lib are no secrets (everone can imagine
what's in there...) and i wonder what's so secret in /etc (except perhaps
/etc/shadow) that someone has to encrypt it. even when it is secret, i
doubt it can't be loaded *after* the system is up and running and mounting
crypto devices is available (and thus links from /etc/my_secret to /sec
should be there). i even see 2 disadvantages in having an encrypted root:
 - nasty chicken-and-egg problems as shown by the OP
 - speed decrease in fs access (well, at least on my 500Mhz system this is
still an issue)

&gt; 	Hi there...I am looking for a simple tool which I can use to encrypt and compress \

&gt; 	I can use command line gpg and compress/gzip for it but my \

&gt; 	Can anybody share any of his experiances regarding this?

Hi Stuart,

(1) Absolutely - journaling filesystems depend upon the maintenance of
the order of device write operations. Where this is not the case, file
system recovery based upon the journal has the potential to be very
dangerous.

(2) The "PS. Kernel 2.6" comment was made by Majek in his original
e-mail. The implications of ordered device writes vs journaling
filesystems apply across the board including 2.6. The potential problems
are inherent to the the very flexibility of a loop device - you can
potentially construct looped filesystems n-levels deep.

BTW, I cannot claim the arguments as "mine" or take credit :-) Happy to
accept the blame for all errors. Comments/clarifications welcome.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2.2. Use of journaling file systems on loop device
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; Don't use a journaling file system on top of file backed loop device. Device
&gt; backed loop device can be used with journaling file systems as device backed
&gt; loops guarantee that writes reach disk platters in order required by
&gt; journaling file system (write caching must be disabled on the disk drive, of
&gt; course). With file backed loop devices, correct write ordering may extend
&gt; only to page cache (which resides in RAM) of underlying file system. VM can
&gt; write such pages to disk in any order it wishes, and thus break write order
&gt; expectation of journaling file system.

I wrote a sort-of long howto about cryptoloop-based encrypted root at
http://www.sdc.org/~leila/usb-dongle

I think it is noted in the TLDP HOWTO.

My efforts focused on a pivot_root boot from a uClibc-based mini-system 
on a USB flash device. The web site has source code and an example 
filesystem image.

I never completed the write-up, as I wanted to personally use 
everything that I documented. I got stuck on the bootable CD, believe 
it or not, but figured out how to do that just a couple of days ago. So 
although the document is a year old, I was planning on dusting it off 
and updating it.

But I must say that I'm in the process of moving my stuff from 
crypto-loop to loop-AES!

&lt;p align="justify" style="line-height: 22px; margin-top: 5px"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt"&gt;Minister Socha w wywiadach udzielanych w trakcie 
emisji akcji PKO BP mówi³ o czynniku natury spo³ecznej i atrakcyjno¶ci 
inwestycji maj±cej zachêciæ osoby fizyczne do gie³dy. Cena emisyjna mia³a 
gwarantowaæ godziwy zysk przysz³ym nabywcom. „Czynnik spo³eczny” maj±cy \
zagwarantowaæ osobom  fizycznym godziwy zysk rozci±gn±³ siê na osoby zagraniczne, \
w tym  inwestorów instytucjonalnych... Jaki jest powód aby zapewniæ inwestorom 
zagranicznym godziwy zysk na prywatyzacji PKO BP?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify" style="line-height: 22px; margin-top: -5px"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt"&gt;Dlaczego minister Socha sprzedaje PKO BP znacznie 
taniej ani¿eli cena równowagi popytu i poda¿y? Na jakiej podstawie minister 
skarbu zabiega o wp³ywy (zarobek) nabywców akcji, zamiast o zarobek skarbu 
pañstwa? Firma jest warta tyle ile nabywcy chc± w danej sytuacji rynkowej za ni± 
zap³aciæ. 90% redukcja zapisów ¶wiadczy, i¿ ustalono cenê akcji znacznie poni¿ej 
jej warto¶ci rynkowej – „czynnik natury spo³ecznej”. Minister \
skarbu je¿eli ma  tak± wolê mo¿e rozdawaæ swój prywatny maj±tek, ale dlaczego rozdaje \
maj±tek  publiczny? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify" style="line-height: 22px; margin-top: -4px"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt"&gt;Za zysk osób i funduszy nabywaj±cych akcje PKO BP 
zap³ac± wszyscy obywatele. Pieni±dze podziel± pomiêdzy siebie nabywcy akcji PKO. 
Wszyscy zarobili na niskiej cenie PKO BP, tylko Skarb Pañstwa straci³ - czyli 
ca³e spo³eczeñstwo, tak¿e ci których nie staæ by³o na zakup akcji oraz nie staæ 
na zakup leków, które powinny byæ finansowane z publicznych pieniêdzy. Panie 
Ministrze, dlaczego sprzedaje Pan – z premedytacj± – maj±tek publiczny za \
cenê  ni¿sz± od rynkowej? Ró¿nica tylko 1 z³oty w cenie akcji PKO BP oznacza przy 
sprzeda¿y 380 mln akcji warto¶æ 380 mln z³otych odebranych Pañstwu – czyli 
wszystkim obywatelom.&lt;br&gt;
Czy minister Socha zamierza zwróciæ kwotê kilkuset milionów z³otych ze swojego 
prywatnego maj±tku?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify" style="line-height: 22px; margin-top: -4px"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt"&gt;Zarobi³y osoby, które zakupi³y akcje, reszta stanowi±ca \
 99% spo³eczeñstwa straci³a. Kto¶ zarobi³ aby kto¶ móg³ straciæ. Zarobili ci co 
maj± pieni±dze i kupuj± akcje, a stracili ci co nie maj± pieniêdzy i nie kupili 
akcji. Sprzedawany by³ maj±tek wszystkich, nie prywatne akcje ministra Sochy. 
Inwestorzy zamierzali kupiæ od skarbu pañstwa znacznie dro¿ej, jednak minister 
siê upar³ i powiedzia³, ¿e chce sprzedaæ taniej. Ograniczenie górnej ceny 
spowodowa³o, ¿e t³um siê ustawi³ w kolejki, a na sesji by³a 90% redukcja... Po 
prostu minister siê upar³, ¿e da zarobiæ inwestorom kosztem skarbu \
pañstwa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify" style="line-height: 22px; margin-top: -4px"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt"&gt;Minister Socha z premedytacj± zani¿y³ cenê 
sprzeda¿y akcji PKO BP w oparciu o „czynnik natury spo³ecznej”. Ten&lt;span \
lang="en"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sam czynnik  powinien doprowadziæ ministra Sochê przed oblicze \
wymiaru sprawiedliwo¶ci. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="justify" style="line-height: 22px; margin-top: -15px"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt"&gt;Wszyscy zarobili, a zap³aci³ za to minister 
skarbu. Zap³aci³ nie swoimi pieniêdzmi. MSP sprzeda³o akcje za 20.50&lt;span \
lang="en"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;z³otych,  a mog³o sprzedaæ za 22.50-23 z³ote. Minister 
Socha rzeczywi¶cie na si³ê chcia³ daæ zarobiæ inwestorom. Czy kurs wzro¶nie po \
sprzeda¿y w  ofercie publicznej czy nie to ju¿ inna sprawa - albo wzro¶nie o 30% albo \

najbardziej ma znaczenie  – dziêki niej akcje s± obarczone mniejszym ryzykiem i \
za to mo¿na uzyskaæ  w³a¶nie wy¿sz± cenê sprzeda¿y.&lt;br&gt;
Wa¿ne jest to, ¿e gdy Socha sprzedawa³ akcje po ustalonej przez siebie cenie to 
popyt znacznie przewy¿sza³ ofertê -  &lt;span style="letter-spacing: 1px"&gt;w&lt;span \
lang="en"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ka¿dej kategorii inwestorów!&lt;/span&gt; Minister Socha zamiast \
ustaliæ cenê równowagi, ustali³ cenê ni¿sz±. &lt;br&gt; Gdyby zarz±dzaj±cy prywatnym \
maj±tkiem tak sprzedawa³ akcje swojego mocodawcy to  by ¼le skoñczy³. Ale minister \

The point is someone at the data center cannot unplug the thing, pop the hard 
drives out and then return them two days later after making a mirror of the 
thing like they did with the Indymedia servers that were stolen from 
rackspace. See http://uk.indymedia.org/ if you have not heard.
 
At least when you get it back you only have to recreate your boot partition 
from a trusted backup and trust the server again. Or let some judicial review 
and due process take place before handing over the keys (if you have a choice 
and are not in some gulag as is so common with our _in_justice system these 
days). Also, if only the client had the keys, then it would leave the ISP out 
of the loop. And again, it would be possible to create a server with 
ephemeral keys so that the data and the server is completely lost if powered 
down. 

I have not had time to work out this configuration with ssh yet. I think a 
better solution is to offer remote console access via blade servers for 
example, so that the client can have full control of the entire process 
remotely and be completely responsible for the server at all times. Anyone on 
this list interested in such a dedicated server solution? (In other words can 
I get some 10 interested people so that it becomes a business proposition?)

Loop-AES does 177GB partition (ext3) with aes and 256bit. Loop-aes does
furthermore 4,7GB DVD-Rs either full of 5*800MB avi (xvid4) or full of
*.jpg.
Loop-aes gets nasty if you burn an encrypted ISO that´s a bit bigger than
the DVD-R. To be on the safe side don´t exceed 4,3GB. In some directories
there were several thousand files, on the DVD. Made with loop-aes and
256bit.
I don´t know anything like that up to now, do you?

Can you:
1) Specify what kernel version you are using.
2) Specify what modutils and/or module-init-tools versions you are using.
3) Send your full compressed kernel config to me privately.
4) Try appending USE_KBUILD=y to make command line that you used to build

The point is someone at the data center cannot unplug the thing, pop the hard
drives out and then return them two days later after making a mirror of the
thing like they did with the Indymedia servers that were stolen from
rackspace. See http://uk.indymedia.org/ if you have not heard.

At least when you get it back you only have to recreate your boot partition
from a trusted backup and trust the server again. Or let some judicial review
and due process take place before handing over the keys (if you have a choice
and are not in some gulag as is so common with our _in_justice system these
days). Also, if only the client had the keys, then it would leave the ISP out
of the loop. And again, it would be possible to create a server with
ephemeral keys so that the data and the server is completely lost if powered
down.

I have not had time to work out this configuration with ssh yet. I think a
better solution is to offer remote console access via blade servers for
example, so that the client can have full control of the entire process
remotely and be completely responsible for the server at all times. Anyone on
this list interested in such a dedicated server solution? (In other words can
I get some 10 interested people so that it becomes a business proposition?)

see pt. 8 of the loop-aes README, "Security levels". you're right, when

but since the gpg keys are password-encrypted anyway (right?) and thus
need admin-interaction to actually "mount" the partition, you could

Thanks for clarification. I didn't take into account compatibility with

However, good to see the "classic" method is secure, so I can use it in
my app, where kernel support for loop-aes is assumed.

&gt; and trying to make it public, but there's just too many lemmings out
&gt; there who either just don't care or are incapable of doing so.

That exactly why Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. organized an international
counter-intelligence (publishes EIR, accessible from larouchepub.com)
and an international youth movemet (wlym.com).  Of course, there were
about four attempts for assassination against him, he has been in jail,
and while there, an agent from Mexico working for the Synarchist
International --- Fernando Quijano --- tried to destroy LaRouche's
organization from inside (he definitely demoralized it and had it
somewhat discredited).  In addition, Denis King was hired (sponsored by
the right wing, IIRC) to write a book of slander against LaRouche (Dale
Amon seems to be citing some of the materials used for the book).

I don't want to be rude, but resisting individually agianst
multi-billionare cartels is slightly beyond nonsense.  And indeed,
LaRouche's collaborators were able to identify how did it happen so that
such a massive population of people can sit indifferent to the organized
(by the same Synarchist International) depopulation of Africa, South and
Cetral America, Eastern Europe, and recently, even North America.  (What
the _Children of Satan_ three-part series, now published as a complete
book, reveals.)

The historico-philosophical fight between slavery and freedom has been
traced by many to ancient times.  It is known that ancient Greeks had
slaves and Spartans had a pretty cruel empire resembling in some ways
the empire designed by modern oligarchs, such as Bertrand Russell and
Aldous Huxley.  LaRouche has identified the source of the fight as the
question of how does one know.

Empiricists, such as Aristotel, say that the only way to know something
is to look at what your senses indicate in an as sterile manner as
possible.  But since senses could be tricked, this presumpion leads
empiricists (explicitly noted by the ancient nihilists) to the
conclusion that one cannot know anything, because one's senses may have
been tricked all the time (i.e. one could be in the Matrix).  Therefore,
nihilists say: 1) nothing exists, 2) if anything exists, it is not known
(you cannot tell if your senses are tricked or not), 3) if something
exists and is known, it is not communicateable (other people could not
tell if you are telling them the truth, or if you even exist).  Bertarnd
Russell himself, said `I would never die for my beliefs because I might
be wrong.'  Empiricism is also the basis of sophism which was a way of
disputing that the ancient sophists used to persuade someone in whatever
they were paid to persuade this person.  Empiricsts tend to adopt the
idea (in which, they don't believe, but still hold to) that the only
thing that matters is satisfaction of the senses.  People like that
don't care if people are enslaved, or dying, or even if humanity becomes
extinct, after all these people may not even exist.  Also, empiricists
have been known to create occultist science, because since they think
nothing can be known, it suffices to give a discription of what is
observed, and it does not matter what the description is.  (That's when
scientists say that they are just going to assume some unprovable
axioms, i.e. arbitrarilly, and work with them.)

Idealists, like Plato, on the other hand say that the universe is
lawful, in other words there are principles behind every single process.
Therefore, by looking at the processes --- shadows of the principles ---
one can infer the principles, and thus know things, even if one is
unable to sense them.  For example, Kepler discerned that planets orbit
according to some interaction between them similar to the electrostatic
one (Kepler discovored the principle of gravity, in _Mysterium
Cosmographicum_, which was later appropriated by the chairman of the
Royal Academy of Science --- Newton who was studying black magic at the
time); therefore, today we know that the Earth orbits the Sun, even
though we cannot explicitly sense that process (and even Kepler could
not).  The tradition of idealism is the one from which all the great
scientists come from (such as Plato, Kepler, Leibniz, Gauss, or even
Einstein and Heisenberg).  Of course, there have been operations against
them throughout all the history --- Leibniz's calculus developed in the
attempt to solve Kepler's problem was privatized by Newton, Gauss's and
Einsten's discoveries have been incorporated in an empirical formal
system that starts with unproven axioms, stripping the whole method of
knowing that has been incorporated in these discoveries, etc.

Anyway, as to modern history, the period of the second World War and the
times after that are quite important.  It was in these years that the
Farkfurt school of thought (that originated at the university in
Frankfurt am Mein in Germany) conducted extesive research on what kind
of idiology does one need to have in a population, so that the
population can accept fascism.  They developed bulky theories based on
empiricism.  For example, the method of Logical Positivism came out of
there.  The premise of this method is that the only way one knows
something is by starting with some (of course, unprovable, i.e.
arbitrary) axioms and then following formal logic.  Incidentally, this
seems to have been a technique exploited by the sophists to persuade
people in whatever they wanted.  Of course, logical positivism has
proven unusable in the physical universe for the purposes of science and
has been thrown out of some disciplines (for example, archaeology).  It
however, served many of the Frankfurt school philosophers, and was
emloyed in the fields of sociology (which was started at that school
IIRC), psychology, and the arts.  Here is something about Theodore
Adorno (who became head of the psychology department of the Frankfurt
school) from
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Frankfurt_School&amp;oldid=4862683&gt;:

	Adorno, a trained musician, wrote The Philosophy of Modern
	Music, in which he, in essence, polemicizes against beauty
	itself-- because anything which does not further the destruction
	of bourgeois society, reinforces the "authoritarian" impulse.
	Hence:
	
	"What radical music perceives is the untransfigured suffering of
	man...  The seismographic registration of traumatic shock
	becomes, at the same time, the technical structural law of
	music. It forbids continuity and development. Musical language
	is polarized according to its extreme; towards gestures of shock
	resembling bodily convulsions on the one hand, and on the other
	towards a crystalline standstill of a human being whom anxiety
	causes to freeze in her tracks... Modern music sees absolute
	oblivion as its goal. It is the surviving message of despair
	from the shipwrecked."
	
	Adorno continues, "...It is not that schizophrenia is directly
	expressed therein; but the music imprints upon itself an
	attitude similar to that of the mentally ill. The individual
	brings about his own disintegration... He imagines the
	fulfillment of the promise through magic, but nonetheless with
	the realm of immediate actuality... Its concern is to dominate
	schizophrenic traits through the aesthetic consciousness. In so
	doing, it would hope to vindicate insanity as true health." To
	anyone who is not fully of the Frankfurt School persuasion, such
	sentiments can only be disturbing.

So the Frankfurt school has engineered the sociological and artistic
basis of a modern form of dictatorship.  And what was the main idea of
this basis?  That one cannot know, that art should not be demonstrating
any idea (principle) by creating irony (just the way a not-yet-known
principle manifests itself by creating a paradox, or a certain
unexplained structure, in the course of a process).  Adorno also
authored the scenario of how to instill this new kind of art in the
existing societies (in one of his essays IIRC).

His plan was to first fetishize art, which meant associating artisting
performances with some kind of fetish.  For example, people should start
going to the opera not for the performance itself, but for showing that
they are of high social status, or that they are rich, or that they are
educated, etc.  After that the performances can be stripped from the
ironies that demonstrate principles through art.

The next step was to create new fetishes and associate them with
entirely new forms of art (Adorno notes the special role of the radio
for that).  The new forms of art should be such that not only will they
hinder people's ability to discover principles and lead them into
oblivion, but also the new art should be naturally unpleasant to the
human being.  Why?  Because with this form of art people will stop to
paying any attention to art.  Only the fetish will remain.  People will
never again think that art can express anything.

Adorno notes however, that after a continuous consumption of this new
form of art some people do realize that they indeed hate it and turn
against it.  As a solution of the problem, Adorno proposes that there
should be many differnt kinds (well, styles) of this art that should be
accepted as being totally different, althogh they are in the same
philosophical framework (that humans cannot know).  For example, there
should be metal that is held to be totally different from hip hop that
is held to be far from techno, etc.  In this situation, when an
individual rebels against a style the individual will naturally adopt a
different one, from the same framework.

And so, as some CIA reports, as well as Francis Saunder's book _The
Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters_, reveal,
during the Cold War there was a somewhat calendestine cultural war
between the west and the communist bloc.  An OPC (well, a subdivision of
the CIA at the time) contact Michael Josselson together with Melvin
Lasky organized a congress that opened on June 26, 1950 in Berlin.  This
was the second convening of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a.k.a.
CCF, (the previous not particularly successful attempt was on April 30
in Paris).  Anti-communist artists were carefully chosen for the
congress beforehand.  At it, in front of thousands of ``cheering
Berliners'' was expressed the ideology of art that had come from the
Frankfurt school:  the idea that art should be free, meaning it need
(and even shouldn't) be based upon principles.  Everything is now art.
Your piss is art, your fart is art, a succession of random frequencies
(i.e. `cat /dev/random &gt; /dev/dsp`) is art, etc.  After the CCF (called
by LaRouche the Sexual Congress for Cultural Fascism) there was a
massive operation by the CIA in which thosands (=millions today) of
dollars were spent (mainly in Europe) on sponsoring newspapers,
articles, TV shows, individual artists, etc. to produce the new form of
art with an ideology that has been publicised by the CCF, so that people
can start consuming the art.

Before going to more recent years, I should mention that right after the
second World War, parallel with the Frankfurt school was operating the
Tavistock Institute in England.  This institute was researching
psychotropic substances (that is, how to control the central nervous
system of a human being (well, or animal) chemically).  William Sargant
was also doing research in this area.  He studied many cults around the
world and tribal rites to see how the mind can be controlled.  Based
upon this research the prominent oligarch Aldous Huxley wrote his _Brave
New World_.  Indeed Huxley went on to study psychotropic substances on
his own.  (Some facts and an engineered interpretation of them can be
found at http://somaweb.org/w/huxbio.html, Huxley's speech about the
Ultimate, or Final, Revolution is here
http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/audiofiles.html#huxley).  Funny, people
call Huxley's society `a possible world', `fiction' and `dystopia', but
today you could order Soma on the Internet, and your psychiatrist may
well prescribe it to you...

Huxley's policies match Bertrand Russell's ones like:

	The social psychologists of the future will have a number of
	classes of school children on whom they will try different
	methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is
	black. Various results will be arrived at. First, that the
	influence of the home is obstructive.  Second, that not much can
	be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten.
	Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very
	effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be
	held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity.
	
	...
	Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be
	rigidly confined to the governing class. The population will not
	be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the
	technique has been perfected, every government that has been in
	charge of education for a generation will be able to control its
	subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.
	
	-- Bertrand Russell, 1951, _The Impact of Science on Society_

These policies approach reality around the 60s with the counter-culture.
The baby-boomers (the children of the World War II veterans, children
that have grown up with the new forms of art and social ideology) rioted
against `the evils of the world' like the Vietnam war, essentially
saying `We are going to solve our problems with the evils by dropping
out of school, taking drugs, being promiscuous, and performing other
bestial and mind-destroying acts.'  And the counter-culture didn't come
in `on its own', there were people behind the riots and `celebrities'
popularizing bestial behaviour.  That was an implementation of Huxley's
model of a society in which people were just finding _outlets_ to make
themselves uncapable of acting by any way that can have a sizeable
effect upon the universe (or oppose the policies being implemented for
that matter).  These same people are in today's government,
universities, industries, etc.  They run the US society.  Or more
acurately, they are used by financially powered cartels (of oligarchs,
of course) to run the US and other similar societies.

Well, I didn't mention how did today's financial system come about; and
why money today are not related to anything in the physical universe.
This question is important because it gave financial powers full control
over the population.  Multi-billionare cartels today can determine
prices of currencies, the fate of industries, even art, the population
of a region, etc.  And this goes back to Maastricht.  But I think I
wrote enough for today.

I will just mention that the following policies are part of what is
being implemented:

	At present the population of the world is increasing at about
	58,000 per diem.  War, so far, has had no very great effect on
	this increase, which continued throughout each of the world
	wars.  War has hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but
	perhaps bacteriological war may prove effective.  If a Black
	Death could spread throughout the world once in every
	generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the
	world too full.  The state of affairs might be unpleasant, but
	what of it?
	
	-- Bertrand Russell, _The Impact of Science on Society_,
	Routledge Press, New York, 1951.
	
	... nothing stirs me, nothing seems worth doing or worth having
	done: the only thing that I strongly FEEL worth while would be
	to murder as many people as possible so as to diminish the
	amount of consciousness in the world.
	
	-- Bertrand Russell in a letter to a friend from 1903.

In an effort to stop writing I will jump to the present moment,
mentioning that the LaRouche Youth Movement in the USA is campaigning
for John Kerry with the parallel efforts to teach Kerry some of the
classified history of our civilization and have him see the principle's
behing the variuos massive infrastructure projects developed by
LaRouche's collaborators (well, some of them are based on already
existing designs that never came into being) that will stimulate
businesses and help the world economy get rebuilt after the ~40 years of
destruction.  Of course, ending the bankers' financial system will be
crucial, so that money can be used for what their purpose in society is
--- to allocate human resources to the different branches of society
development.

Hello,



I set up a Redhat 8.0 system with a encrypted data storage
some years ago. With some rpms announced on this list it was
 no problem. Now later the hard drive storing the Linux system
is dead. The data is ok (I think) and stored on raid 5 disks. 

My problem is that no Linux distribution I install now can read 
the encrypted data, not even with the right password.

I believe the patches I applied that time changed losetup in 
more ways than just applying the crypto patches. I also could
use an option '-k' to set the keys size. It does not seem to
exist in any other version of losetup.

My current strategy is to try to build a identical system. Install
scratch and then apply the needed patches. Unfortually the web page
holding the rpm files to update RH 8.0 is now dead.

http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~hvr/crypto/redhat-8.0/

Does anyone know some other site for these files or perhaps someone
still have copies stored locally?

Any help with the necessary rpm or other ideas are most welcome.

regards
/Tobias Eriksson

Hi.

Recently I've been a bit frustrated about the unavailability of Allan 
Latham's venerable PPDD for contemporary Linux versions. Thus I decided 
to port it to new Crypto API, allowing it to be run with latest 2.4 kernels.

The patches and some instructions are available at 
&lt;URL:http://retiisi.dyndns.org/~sailus/ppdd/&gt;.

The site works also with HTTPS. The site certificate's fingerprints are:

SHA1: CB:61:CC:96:F3:D1:75:88:2D:B1:31:9A:B9:15:9F:E3:5F:9C:9B:18
MD5: 0A:EB:92:9D:72:6B:63:43:B7:81:83:A5:25:19:F0:9E

(I should probably start using GnuPG more often. ;))

I intend to port PPDD it to 2.6 later after I've cleaned up things a bit 
on 2.4 side.

Hi
I found that it is possible to encrypt device without using aes-pipe.
After /dev/hda1 has been associated with loop device /dev/loop0 this
command:

# dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/loop0

Encrypts hda1 and makes filesystem on this device accessible via loop0.

I'm developing application, which I don't like to depend on aes-pipe.

Well, this method worked for my test filesystem, but I'm not sure if it
will work in every situation. Does anybody on the list see any dangers
in this method compared to classic "dd if=dev|aespipe|dd of=loop"?

&gt; &gt; me know.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried to reproduce these error, with these settings:
&gt;
&gt; - 1 KB and 4 KB soft block size file systems.
&gt; - Various IDE disk 'hdparm -m ? /dev/hdd' values.
&gt; - Different I/O elevators: as, cfq, deadline

&gt; - Repartitioned disk with different partition layouts.
&gt; - Small and large writes to files.
&gt; - Two gcc versions 2.95.4 and 3.3.2
&gt; - regparm off and regparm=3
&gt;
&gt; I haven't tested all possible combinations of above, but so far I have
&gt; been unable reproduce these errors.

OK, I've done some further testing: I now use 2.6.7 with loop-AES 2.1c (2.1b 
previously), just to see if the new version of loop-AES together with the 
old kernel made any difference. It doesn't, my machine is running all fine.


In addition, I meditated a bit about the bug's behavior, and came up with 
the following (partly speculative) points:

* it seems to appear faster when the system is under load, e.g I'm compiling 
stuff while working. As the partition affected is /home, on which the file 
system remains quiet when compiling (using "emerge"), this does bnot 
neccessarily mean much, but:

* a pretty certain way to trigger it is to fire up my KMail and work with 
it. I have a 1.4 GB ~/Mail, with some pretty large folders, some in mbox 
(e.g. inbox, 86 MB or an archive of older inbox contents, ~350 MB)), some 
in maildir format. So maybe it's somehow linked to access to large files on 
encrypted ext3, and/or a larger number of open files. 

* my understanding of lines like
&gt; Aug 23 18:33:08 [kernel] EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_readdir: 
&gt; directory #783444 contains a hole at offset 4096
is that "directory #" refers to the inode number, so the dir causing 
problems can be found using find -inum. If that assumption is correct, the 
two dirs having "triggered" the problem are:
  - my ~/downloads dir, lots of files, a number of subdirs, the place I
    unpack and compile e.g. WINE in. Total size of 1.3 GB. 
    "find downloads/ | wc -l" says 23402
  - ~/Mail/Spamverdacht/new, part of a maildir folder containing mail that
    is consindered spam by my filters, for review. The dir is currently
    empty, but I think when the errors occurred, at least one time it was
    pretty full (about 4000 messages, i.e. about 4000 small files).
    This does make some sense, as KMail is pretty good at triggering the
    problem.


I haved looked through the kernel Changelog from 2.6.7 to 2.6.8.1 but I 
didn't see anything that looked suspicious to me. Maybe the information of 
the above paragraph can provide some starting points or some ideas.

David

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Fixed multi-key ioctl incompatibility with sparc64 boxes running 64 bit
  kernel and 32 bit userland. Fix enabled for 2.4.26 and later 2.4 kernels.
  2.6 kernels were not affected.
- Added key scrubbing support for AES loop cipher. This feature is not
  enabled by default because it doubles storage space requirement for loop
  encryption keys. To enable, add KEYSCRUB=y parameter to loop module make
  command. (2.4 and 2.6 kernels only).
- Added multi-key compatibility to losetup and mount -p option handling.
- Fixed incompatibility with 2.6.8.1 kernel struct bio handling.
- Small optimization to bio I/O barrier support. Also added support for
  queue-&gt;issue_flush_fn() I/O barrier calls. (2.6 kernels only).
- Added workaround for kernel bug that causes I/O errors on -EWOULDBLOCK I/O
  elevator failures (2.6 kernels only).

Hi guys,

I'm building a linux (2.6) embedded device, the system will boot from a 
compact flash device.

I'm actively looking for a way to encrypt the data stored in the compact 
flash to preevent possible reverse engineering of the custom 
applications and also to preevent 3rd party modification and related 
services abusing.

I'm very pleased of the results I achieved using loop-aes and I was 
wondering if any of you guys can suggest me some possible solutions to 
reach my goal.

The fisr problem I encounter is realted to the password storage, 
considering that the embedded device will not have keyboard, serial 
console and that it will be installed in an hostile/untrusted 
environment. If I store it in the compact flash someone will be able to 
read it and as said before the human input is not an option.

The only non-crypto solution I found is redesign the whole bootstrapping 
architecture, build a light/intelligent that will boot download from our 
servers to ram the real kernel, a cramfs image containing the 
preconfigured applications and tools, pivot the root and kexec to the 
fresh downlaoded full featured kernel.

I'm sorry for the non-crypto related informations of my last sentence 
but I wanted to make a clear picture of what I'm trying to achieve, 
maybe this could be useful for someone else working on a similar project.

Thanx a lot in advance for your time guys, any feedback will be very 
appreciated.

Best,

nettie

I have had to install SuSe on a system that had an encrypted backup 
drive. Much as I love Gentoo, I had to install SuSe on this system for 
compatability reasons, which I wont go into here.
I had the loop device created using the gentoo 2.6 kernel and whatever 
loop and crypto modules are in the default gentoo 2.6 kernel. I didn't 
do any aditional compilation for loop-AES as far as I can remember (it 
was a while ago that I set it up).   I created the loop device with a 
script that basically executed the command:

losetup -e aes-cbc-128 -p0 /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb1 &lt; /etc/backup/aes.key

Where the aes.key file has a random alpanumeric string of 60 characters.
It then mounts the /dev/loop0 device to the mount point with:

mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /mnt/backup

I backed up the script and key before reinstalling the system and put 
them back on the new system, but when I run the script it creates the 
/dev/loop0 with the same options sucessfully but fails to mount as it 
recons the ext2 fs isn't there or is corrupt.   It is behaving as if the 
key is wrong but it is not. 

The /dev/sdb1 device is a USB external disk.   I have several of these 
devices with encrypted info on them, fortunatly, none of which is 
critical. One of the drives does have some stuff which I would like to 
recover to save having to set up again. As an experement I tried running 
mke2fs /dev/loop0 on one of the non important drives and it 
reinitialises the ext2 partition, which then sets up and mounts fine.   

My main query is what would be difference between the way the gentoo 2.6 
kernel and the SuSe 2.6 kernel handle the Crypto loop devices. I tried 
both the Cryptoloop that is in the standard SuSe kernel and I also 
compiled a custom Kernel without the loop device and compiled the 
loop-aes loop device that I downloaded from sourceforge. Both gave the 
same results of a sucessful execution of the losetup command but with an 
unreadable ext2 FS. I have checked the key is correct and it is, but the 
results are as if it was wrong. The only thing I can think of is that 
there is some difference between the two systems in the way the keys are 
handled, or there is some sort of seeding that I am unaware of.

Any help or suggestions would be greatfully acepted.

Yeah, you got it. Gentoo's losetup is closer to that of the stock
util-linux package, in that it no longer hashes the passphrase. You would
have had to use hashalot for that. OTOH SuSe's losetup has patched in
the old passphrase hashing code. So the key to your loop device is
actually the unhashed passphrase, but SuSe is trying to decrypt it with
the hashed passphrase.

Your best bet is to download util-linux
&lt;URL:ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/&gt;, build losetup
from there, and then use that losetup to access your data. After that,
you'll want to re-create the loop devices with SuSe's losetup, because
an encrypted device with an unhashed passphrase is kinda weak.

HTH,

If you are using losetup and mount from loop-AES package, you can specify
mainline util-linux compatible key setup like this:

  losetup -e AES256 -H unhashed2 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb1 &lt;/etc/backup/aes.key
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Or kerneli.org compatible key setup like this:

  losetup -e AES256 -H rmd160 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb1 &lt;/etc/backup/aes.key
                    ^^^^^^^^^

I finally got it working by downloading the util-linux and util-linux 
cryptoloop patch from the gentoo mirror, compiling it on the suse system 
and running it from the compiled directory.   I don't know what the hell 
is done differently but something obviously is.

Thanks for your suggestions,   they put me on the right track.

Keep up the good work

:-)

Anything that can be moved into main memory (for execution) can be
exchanged, reverse engineered and, if needed, altered, too.

&gt; The fisr problem I encounter is realted to the password storage, 
&gt; considering that the embedded device will not have keyboard, serial 
&gt; console and that it will be installed in an hostile/untrusted 
&gt; environment. If I store it in the compact flash someone will be able to 
&gt; read it and as said before the human input is not an option.

Correct. But as I said, that's pretty much a conceptual problem. ...and
to be honest: I for one prefer having control over the devices I use!

&gt; The only non-crypto solution I found is redesign the whole bootstrapping 
&gt; architecture, build a light/intelligent that will boot download from our 
&gt; servers to ram the real kernel, a cramfs image containing the 
&gt; preconfigured applications and tools, pivot the root and kexec to the 
&gt; fresh downlaoded full featured kernel.

For sure, there'll be an easy way to intercept that. I think about
embedded device's debugging interface and the like.

Don't waste your time here. Just accept that you won't be able to make
that bullet-proof...

&gt; I'm sorry for the non-crypto related informations of my last sentence 
&gt; but I wanted to make a clear picture of what I'm trying to achieve, 
&gt; maybe this could be useful for someone else working on a similar project.

Well, I don't think that it'll work at all, I think it's a bad idea and
I think that most open/free source developers won't really like to see
or support work-in-progress in that direction, with the possible
exception of detecting proprietary programs being started.

The patch that I posted on Sunday is a needed fix, but not having the patch
applied causes slightly inefficient operation but no data loss. I realized
that yesterday evening, so I was kind of expecting this "does not help"

&gt;&gt; OK, I've done some further testing: I now use 2.6.7 with loop-AES

JR&gt; Thanks, that narrows problem to yet unidentified kernel change
JR&gt; that causes loop-AES code to misbehave.

the the same for me, i had no problems while using 2.1b or 2.1c
with the old kernel, so i also think that it is not related to a
change in loopAES. but if i switch the kernel to a newer one i get
these errors (from 2.6.6-1.435.2.3 to 2.6.7-1.494.2.2). yesterday i
tested the latest fedora kernel 2.6.8-1.521 and voila the error
appeared again. 


JR&gt; OK, then I need to test huge directories with some 'syncing'
JR&gt; application. I installed kmail on my test box, but as of this
JR&gt; writing ~/Mail dir has only few zero length files.

i am doing tests on 3 different testsetups now. so far i am not able
to reproduce the error :( all boxes are running with fedora-core2 and
the same custom kernel (like on the box which breaks once a day).

lets see what happens.

Hello,




- I am happily using loop-AES since quite a time on my ASUS L3800C Laptop 
(Pentium 4 Mobile, gentoo Linux), frequently upgrading both loop-AES 
versions and kernel, usually to the latest of the 2.6 series. The last 
upgrade from 2.6.7 (loop-AES 2.1b) to 2.6.8.1 (loop-AES 2.1c) however did 
not turn out to be a fortunate one.

My hdd has several partitions, all of them being ext3, except for /tmp, 
which runs reiserfs, and of course swap. Swap, /home (ext3) and /tmp 
(reiser) are encrypted with loop-AES' AES128 encryption.

All is running fine, except for the encrypted /home, which shows this error 
after some time of work (usually 10 to 30 minutes):

&gt; Aug 16 19:36:26 [kernel] EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_readdir:
&gt; directory # 783444 contains a hole at offset 8192
&gt; Aug 16 19:36:32 [kernel] ext3_abort called.
&gt; Aug 16 19:36:32 [kernel] EXT3-fs abort (device loop0): ext3_journal_start:
&gt; Detected aborted journal
&gt; Aug 16 19:37:04 [kernel] EXT3-fs error (device loop0) in
&gt; start_transaction: Journal has aborted
&gt;                 - Last output repeated 4 times -
&gt; Aug 16 19:37:22 [su(pam_unix)] session closed for user root
&gt; Aug 16 19:37:22 [kernel] EXT3-fs error (device loop0) in
&gt; start_transaction: Journal has aborted
&gt;                 - Last output repeated 52 times -

After unmounting /home, and running e2fsck on it (which repaired the error), 
I remounted /home, just to have the same kind of error again after some 15 
minutes. I repeated this several times, rebooted - problem remains. The 
only thing that changes (sometimes) is the number of the directory that 
"contains a hole". As all other ext3 (unencrypted) partitions are running 
fine without these symptoms, i suspect a problem with loop-AES and the new 
kernel. 

I did not really change the configuration for my kernel (did a make 
oldconfig); the only "major" thing that is different between my 2.6.7 and 
my 2.6.8.1 config is the use of mregparm=3 in the latter case. I will try 
if the problem goes away when disabling that option, but in the meantime, I 
would be very happy about any suggestions what might be the cause of this 
mess. FYI, I have write caching disabled on the disk, and smartmon does not 
show any problems on the drive. Oh, and if anybody has a viable idea how to 
efficiently debug this thingy, preferably _without_ risking my data, I 
would surely appreciate it ;) For now, I have reverted to 2.6.7 and not 
encountering any trouble, so I think a hardware problem is not very 
probable.



Thanks,



David

hmmm, suspicious, but not clear enough. i'd suggest that you send this
report to ext3-users [1] too, just in case it's pure ext3 related.

I am unable to reproduce any such errors in my test using kernel 2.6.8.1 and
loop-AES-v2.1c and ext3 file system on my x86 test box.

&gt; I did not really change the configuration for my kernel (did a make
&gt; oldconfig); the only "major" thing that is different between my 2.6.7 and
&gt; my 2.6.8.1 config is the use of mregparm=3 in the latter case.

I have tested loop-AES using mregparm=3 in my earlier tests, and they worked
ok. gcc version in those tests was 3.3.2 . Today's test kernel was compiled
with Debian woody gcc-2.95.4, and no mregparm=3 was used.

I quickly browsed through ext3 changes from kernel 2.6.7 to 2.6.8.1, and I
did't see any obvious change that would cause this problem.

loop-AES-v2.1b to loop-AES-v2.1c changes include addition of two missing
flush_dcache_page() function calls to loop code, but on x86 that function is
defined as no-operation:

# grep flush_dcache_page include/asm-i386/*.h
include/asm-i386/cacheflush.h:#define flush_dcache_page(page)  do { } while (0)

&gt; I will try if the problem goes away when disabling that option

Please let me know how that works out.

&gt; I have reverted to 2.6.7 and not encountering any trouble

2.6.7+loop-AES-v2.1b or 2.6.7+loop-AES-v2.1c ?

&gt; with Debian woody gcc-2.95.4, and no mregparm=3 was used.

I recompiled kernel 2.6.8.1 using gcc-3.3.2 and this time with mregparm=3.
I stress tested ext3 file system on loop-AES-v2.1c, using AES128 encryption
for 8 hours. Again, I was unable to reproduce these errors.

&gt; &gt; I am unable to reproduce any such errors in my test using kernel
&gt; &gt; 2.6.8.1 and loop-AES-v2.1c and ext3 file system on my x86 test box.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did not really change the configuration for my kernel (did a make
&gt; &gt; &gt; oldconfig); the only "major" thing that is different between my 2.6.7
&gt; &gt; &gt; and my 2.6.8.1 config is the use of mregparm=3 in the latter case.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have tested loop-AES using mregparm=3 in my earlier tests, and they

Thanks a lot for your efforts! I shall try to debug the problem further this

OK, I recompiled my 2.6.8.1+loop-AES 2.1c without mregparm=3 and tried the 
following:

* updated portage tree (emerge rsync) and started an excessive compile to 
get some load on /var and /usr (both unencrypted ext3) - worked fine
* while the compile had already been running for some time, log into X and 
start KDE. Fire up som konquerors, surf, run some emerge -pv etc. and run 
KMail to check my mails. When writen a response to a mail I recieved, KMail 
died saying someting about insufficient write permissions on its temporary 
file, and voila, the old error had reoccured:

i can confirm this. i also run into this problem while upgrading the
kernel. but let me explane. 

my fileserver is running fedora-core 2 + loopAES on a hardware raid5
(3ware 7506-4LP). this box worked like a charm until i upgraded to the
latest fedora-kernel 2.6.7-1.494.2.2 (of course custom with loopAES
2.1c as a module). there where _no_ errors in the past. i am running
this for 1 year now starting with something like 2.4.13 and loopAES
1.6X.

last kernel before the error occured: 2.6.6-1.435.2.3custom with
loopAES 2.1b and loopAES 2.1c (running fine for weeks)

then with 2.6.7-1.494.2.2custom:

Aug 16 08:53:06 gk kernel: EXT3-fs error (device loop2):
ext3_readdir: directory #917516 contains a hole at offset 503808

both errors were easy to repair but i switched back to the "old"
kernel because i like my data:). again no problems. 

i have no idea how to reproduce/force this error, it was very rare (2
times in 3 days.) 


DG&gt; Any ideas?

i also have no idea.

Even though I have been unable to reproduce these errors, I believe I found
the cause of these errors.

Kernel 2.6.7 to 2.6.8.1 change involved block driver API change which is
rather nasty thing to do in "stable" kernel series.

When file system code (or in this case loop code) sends I/O requests to
block driver, it fills up a struct bio that tells driver what it should do.
In this case two new entries were added to struct bio, and 2.6 loop code
didn't initialize those value to sane default values that I/O elevator code
was expecting. IOW, elevator code was accessing a structure that had two
uninitialized variables.

Does the patch below fix the problem? David, if you ack that this patch
fixes it for you, then I will have to make new version of loop-AES ASAP.

i am doing tests already. i am also stressing the partition a
little because normally there is nearly no filesystem action. the

i have to wait a bit more to be sure.

i will keep you informed.

Anyway, I am getting the old error again, pretty soon after bootup and 
starting a compile to get some load on the system (on /usr and /var, both 
unencrypted ext3. loop0 is encrypted, device backed /home using ext3):

Aug 23 18:33:08 [kernel] EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_readdir:

Aug 23 18:35:40 [kernel] EXT3-fs error (device loop0) in start_transaction:

In addition, I noticed that after a fresh bootup with 2.6.8.1-loop-AES-2.1c 
(fresh = bootup and root console login, [but KDM started]), when trying to 
do "ls -la /tmp", I was getting an error from ls saying it could not 
read /tmp (encrypted reiserfs, mounted fine). echo "test" &gt; /tmp/tryit &amp;&amp; 
cat /tmp/tryit worked fine, though, and so were "ls /tmp/tryit" and e.g. 
"file /tmp/tryit".


So, no - unfortunately the patch doesn't fix the problem for me with 
2.6.8.1, loop-AES-2.1c (and mregparm enabled, although that shouldn't 
matter). Kernel bootup parameters were "elevator=cfq" (like in the tests 
before), in case that is of any importance. Anyway, thank you, Jari, for 
your efforts so far. If you have any other ideas, please let me know.


Regards,



David

I have tried to reproduce these error, with these settings:

- 1 KB and 4 KB soft block size file systems.
- Various IDE disk 'hdparm -m ? /dev/hdd' values.
- Different I/O elevators: as, cfq, deadline
- Disk write cache on and off.
- Repartitioned disk with different partition layouts.
- Small and large writes to files.
- Two gcc versions 2.95.4 and 3.3.2
- regparm off and regparm=3

I haven't tested all possible combinations of above, but so far I have been
unable reproduce these errors.

David, can you specify
1) what gcc version you are using
2) what file system soft block sizes are you using
3) post 'fdisk -l /dev/hda' output
4) hdparm MultSect value: hdparm -i /dev/hda
5) post compressed kernel config

&gt; &gt; * a pretty certain way to trigger it is to fire up my KMail and work
&gt; &gt; with it. I have a 1.4 GB ~/Mail, with some pretty large folders, some
&gt; &gt; in mbox (e.g. inbox, 86 MB or an archive of older inbox contents, ~350
&gt; &gt; MB)), some in maildir format. So maybe it's somehow linked to access to
&gt; &gt; large files on encrypted ext3, and/or a larger number of open files.
&gt;
&gt; OK, then I need to test huge directories with some 'syncing' application.
&gt; I installed kmail on my test box, but as of this writing ~/Mail dir has
&gt; only few zero length files.

Maybe this output is useful (lsof at the time of writing of this mail):

(I am using KDE 3.3, but that shouldn't really matter)

&gt; Someone, possibly you, posting a script or clear "do this, that, and
&gt; that" instructions would be of great help. No errors on my testing so
&gt; far.

I shall try to write such a thing ASAP.

&gt; the same custom kernel (like on the box which breaks once a day).
&gt;
&gt; lets see what happens.

Maybe we should try to find some things the breaking systems have in common. 
Could you post the same data I posted after Jari's question (GCC version, 
Kernel .config, etc.)? Maybe that helps in narrowing down the search 
space ;)

I was hoping that you would include "Filesystem features" line of tune2fs
output as well. I am interested about presence or non-presence of dir_index
feature in there. So far all my testing has been with dir_index feature
disabled.

AS&gt; b) a second test machine also showing this error

AS&gt; there is also a 3rd test box, but this one oopsed with a jbd error
AS&gt; under heavy load (fsstress from the linux test project) - maybe i
AS&gt; found a new (uncorrelated) fs error.

a few minutes ago the second test machine "b)" also showed an jbd
error. (fyi: this night i started using fsstress from ltp)

i do not know if this error is related to the error we are
hunting. maybe its only related to some other effect caused by
"fsstress"

Ok, no dir_index feature there.

David, Alexander,
Any chance of you testing attached patch? So far I have been unable to
reproduce any errors, so I have to rely on your testing efforts.

I have special test code on my version that attempts to catch I/O page
locking errors, but so far that code hasn't found clear problem cases yet.
Attached patch attempts to close or at least narrow bad effects of I/O page
locking errors. Since I haven't seen any such errors yet, I don't believe
that this patch fixes the problem, but knowing that (fixes or does not fix)
narrows list possible problem sources.

The "Assertion failure in journal_stop()" that Alexander posted on 25 Aug
2004 20:44:22, looked like preempt triggered error.

# grep PREEMPT config-2.6.8.1 kernel-config.box-?
config-2.6.8.1:CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
kernel-config.box-a:CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
kernel-config.box-b:CONFIG_PREEMPT=y

So far all my testing has been with preempt disabled. Any chance that you
also test with preempt disabled?

I don't think the problem is really limited to ext3. Today I accidentally 
booted the wrong kernel (the one causing the errors we're discussing), and 
after the usual symptoms I umounted /home. I looked (as root) into /tmp to 
see if the access error I had seen before reappears - it did. A "ls 
-la /tmp" told me "ls: reading directory /tmp: Input/Output error \n total 
0". I attach an strace of this failed "ls /tmp", maybe that is 
helpful. /tmp is encrypted reiserfs; dmesg says:

Please disregard earlier patches and try attached patch.

The "ls: reading directory /tmp: Input/Output error" was a good clue that
pointed me to right direction. Before I was chasing errors in wrong places.

I confirm this. I had the same error message using 2.6.8.1 with an encrypted
reiserfs. The "Input/Output error" disappear after rebooting with a 2.6.7
and the data are again available without corruption, though I got also some
little file corruption.
I then did a complete backup of the partition and re-formatted to give
reiser4 a try. After a couple hours of work some real data corruption
appeared, though now I don't get the "Input/Output error". Again, rebooting
with 2.6.7 seem to stop the filesystem corruption.

Feel free to give some test to do ... but please, before my backup gets too
old, because the encrypted partition is a /home full of precioussss
things ;)

I'm not subscribed to the list so, please, remember to cc-ing me.

Bye,

&gt; The "ls: reading directory /tmp: Input/Output error" was a good clue that
&gt; pointed me to right direction. Before I was chasing errors in wrong
&gt; places.

Unfortunately, I have to report the problem is still there with the patch 
you sent applied (v2.1c-3.diff.bz2) on 2.6.8.1 with loop-AES-v2.1c, preempt 
disabled (regparams still on, /proc/config.gz attached). Attached are 
another strace output of "ls /tmp", and the output of "ls -la /tmp".

I managed to find a way to easily trigger the bug: cd into directory 
~/Mail/Spamverdacht/new and type "ls -la". Currently, that dir is empty. 
Doing the same thing in ~/downloads (dir #2 having shown the error) didn't 
cause problems.

This is the log output appearing after me triggering the bug. Strange thing 
is that after remounting for e2fsck, e2fsck didn't find any error at all.

I applied the patch and tested it. The error remains there - both the 
"ls /tmp" (encrypted reiserfs) error and the "ls 
~/Mail/Spamverdacht/new/" (encrypted ext3) error. 


These are dmesg lines starting with "loop" after trying the /tmp error:

These are dmesg lines after then trying the ~/Mail/Spamverdacht/new error:

Jari, if you think the whole (un"grep"ped) dmesg output helps you, I'll send 
it to you via mail directly.

Got it!

Above means that underlying device I/O elevator (hda), failed read-ahead
requests (bi_rw=0x2) with -EWOULDBLOCK error code (err=-11, uses same error
code as -EAGAIN). I/O elevator treats read-ahead requests little bit more
relaxed than normal read or write requests. It has liberty to fail them in
case of congestion or free memory pressure. Loop driver reported underlying
device error to file system on top of loop device. File system should have
ignored failed read-ahead requests, but it didn't, so you saw I/O errors as
result. Same situation can happen on unencrypted file systems that do not go
through loop device. It is a kernel bug.

Can you test attached patch? It transforms read-ahead requests from file
system to normal reads for underlying device. Normal read requests should
not fail with -EWOULDBLOCK so this should cure the problem.

OK, that sounds good. One question, though: How come that this error happens 
on encrypted loop device (obviously) more often than on unencrypted 
filesystems, and why can it be triggered so predictively in my 
~/Mail/Spamverdacht/new case?

Just applied it, will test with 2.6.8.1 ASAP.


Thanks again for your efforts,

Ich wollte mal fragen ob dadurch (Jaris Patch v5) o.g. Fehlermeldungen 
verschwunden sind? Das letzte was ich jetzt brauchen kann ist 
eine /home-Partition die streikt, und Verzögerungen durch Wiederaufspielen 
von Backups o.Ä. - mit der Maschine, auf der der Ärger auftritt, muß ich 
jeden Tag arbeiten ;)

&gt; Ich wollte mal fragen ob dadurch (Jaris Patch v5) o.g. Fehlermeldungen
&gt; verschwunden sind? Das letzte was ich jetzt brauchen kann ist
&gt; eine /home-Partition die streikt, und Verzögerungen durch
Wiederaufspielen
&gt; von Backups o.Ä. - mit der Maschine, auf der der Ärger auftritt, muß ich
&gt; jeden Tag arbeiten ;)

lol! ...erm, it may be helpful to post your message in english again, so
that all involved could find an answer? and: did you have these errors
too and did the patch solve it for you?

D'oh. And I thought such a thing would not happen to _me_ ;)

Yes, I have these errors (I am the one who started the thread, remember?), 
and no, I didn't test Jari's patch v5 yet, for the reasons given. My 
question was meant to go to Alexander directly, so I won't repeat it here 
again.

OK, I tested your patch applied to loop-AES 2.1c on 2.6.8.1, and tried all I 
did before to trigger the bug. None of the usual suspects worked (no IO 
error reading encrypted reiserfs /tmp, no ext3 error doing ls in a 
particualr dir on my encrypted ext3 partition, no error putting the system 
under load and using KMail.

After some hours of work on the machine, I now consider it pretty safe to 
say that the error has disappeared, which means that the patch v5 you 
(Jari) posted fixed it. Thanks again for your work, I appreciate it. Are 
you going to report this error to the kernel mailinglist, and is there 
going to be a new version of loop-AES (I suspect that ;-) ?

David

The 'dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/loop0' is the classic method to encrypt a file
system in place. Ancient versions of loop-AES used that method to encrypt
root file system in-place. But since root file system encryption had to be
done using rescue boot-CD or boot-floppy kernel, all of which didn't have
encrypted loop device support, not everyone was able to do the encryption.
Aespipe has the advantage that is does not require any encrypted loop device
support from the kernel, and as such works with all kernels, even non-linux
kernels.

Okay, the same patch works with 2.6.8.1 also. No changes to code 
whatsoever. Only some changes relating to the kernel configuration 
system were made. Of course, it might eat your hard disk for lunch.

Hi JB, thanx for your feedback.

I understand that everything can be reverse engineered but the point is 
a question of effort, mounting a compact flash card and inspecting the 
contents is definitely easyier than exploiting buffer overflows or dump 
memory.

We're not selling a device, we're just offering a service and by 
contract the customer doesnt have the rights to open or modify the 
device (which is our property).

Said that I figure out that there's not an effective way of securing our 
proprietary applications.

Thanx again for your feedback.

Best,

nettie

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I'm actively looking for a way to encrypt the data stored in the compact 
&gt;&gt;flash to preevent possible reverse engineering of the custom 
&gt;&gt;applications and also to preevent 3rd party modification and related 
&gt;&gt;services abusing.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anything that can be moved into main memory (for execution) can be
&gt; exchanged, reverse engineered and, if needed, altered, too.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;The fisr problem I encounter is realted to the password storage, 
&gt;&gt;considering that the embedded device will not have keyboard, serial 
&gt;&gt;console and that it will be installed in an hostile/untrusted 
&gt;&gt;environment. If I store it in the compact flash someone will be able to 
&gt;&gt;read it and as said before the human input is not an option.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Correct. But as I said, that's pretty much a conceptual problem. ...and
&gt; to be honest: I for one prefer having control over the devices I use!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;The only non-crypto solution I found is redesign the whole bootstrapping 
&gt;&gt;architecture, build a light/intelligent that will boot download from our 
&gt;&gt;servers to ram the real kernel, a cramfs image containing the 
&gt;&gt;preconfigured applications and tools, pivot the root and kexec to the 
&gt;&gt;fresh downlaoded full featured kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For sure, there'll be an easy way to intercept that. I think about
&gt; embedded device's debugging interface and the like.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't waste your time here. Just accept that you won't be able to make
&gt; that bullet-proof...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I'm sorry for the non-crypto related informations of my last sentence 
&gt;&gt;but I wanted to make a clear picture of what I'm trying to achieve, 
&gt;&gt;maybe this could be useful for someone else working on a similar project.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I don't think that it'll work at all, I think it's a bad idea and
&gt; I think that most open/free source developers won't really like to see

&gt; is done differently but something obviously is.

I downloaded util-linux-2.12b-cryptoapi-losetup.patch.bz2 from one gentoo
mirror, and that appears to be Ben Slusky's keygen patch. It is little bit
weird because it uses different key setup for interactive and
read-from-filedescriptor modes of operation. Interactive key setup appears
to be mainline util-linux compatible, but read-from-filedescriptor type key
setup reads up to 32 bytes of binary key material from file descriptor.

Anyway, I wrote small converter program that reads up to 32 bytes of binary
key material from stdin and writes out loop-AES unhashed1 password hash type
compatible password to stdout. Source for binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1
program is attached. It can be compiled like this:

  gcc -O2 -Wall binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1.c -o \
/usr/local/bin/binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1

And used like this (with loop-AES patched losetup and mount):

  cat /etc/backup/aes.key | binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1 128 | losetup -p 0 -e AES \
                -H unhashed1 /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb1

                                        number of bits in key (128, 192 or 256)
Or:

  cat /etc/backup/aes.key | binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1 128 | mount -p 0 -t ext2 \
                /dev/sdb1 /mnt -o encryption=AES,phash=unhashed1

  cat /etc/backup/aes.key | binary-key-remap-to-unhashed1 128 | gpg --symmetric -a \
&gt;/etc/fskey-sdb1.gpg  mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /mnt -o \

My Dear,

I am Mrs.Elizabeth Villaveza from Malasyia but now undergoing medical treatment now \
in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire West Africa. I am married to Late Dr.Nicol Villaveza who \
worked with Malasyia embassy here in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire for twelve years before he \
died in the year 2003. We were married for fifteen years without a child.
 
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we \
were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a \
child outside my matrimonial home.   
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $9.5Million (nine Million Five \
hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) in a bank here in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire, presently this \
money is still in the bank's bequest suspence account where it was being deposited by \
my late husband.  
Recently after my previous clinical check up,my Doctor told me that I would not last \
for the next ten months due to cancer problem.Though what disturbs me most is my \
stroke.  
Having known my condition I decided to donate this money to church or a better \
Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct him \
or her,I want a church or individual that will use these money to help churches, \
orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God \
is maintained.   
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and \
my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned \
money to be misused by unbelievers.  
I don't want a situation whereby this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence \
the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where \
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.  
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I \
don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and \
because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them \
to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  
 As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank here in \
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire where the money is being deposited.   
I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My \
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.Whoever that wants to serve \
the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth.   
Please always be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your reply will give me \
room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose.  
 Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Advised. 
 
Hoping to hear from you and wishing Remain blessed in
the name of the Lord.
 
Yours in Christ,
 
Mrs.Elizabeth Villaveza.

pgp multi-key setup is better, especially if patched version of gpg is used
(patch from loop-AES tarball).

&gt; I think pgp must store some kind of checksum of the encrypted data, because
&gt; it recognizes if one enters a wrong password.

If I remember correctly, encrypted data is prefixed with random bits and
another 16 bits that are copies of earlier random bits. When decrypting, gpg
knows that passphrase was wrong if those 16 bits decrypt incorrectly. Also,
newer gpg on-disk formats include encrypted sha1 hash of the data.

&gt; I assume it could be exploited to speed up cracking?

Nope. Most of the per passphrase computing cost is in iterated+salted key
setup. And loop-AES' gpg patch makes key iteration 128 times slower than the
default value.

That is not expected. That CD-ROM will not work ok. Most likely boot loader

Boot should proceed to "password:" prompt even if root partition is not yet
encrypted.

&gt;&gt;Soon I also want to do what Jari described at
&gt;&gt;http://www.spinics.net/lists/crypto/msg01063.html. Could you, Jari, make
&gt;&gt;this patch available at sourceforge with your signature, possibly with a
&gt;&gt;small README (you could copy most things from the URL mentioned above),
&gt;&gt;also telling how to apply the patch?
&gt; That patch should work if loopinfo.lo_name is changed to
&gt; loopinfo.lo_file_name in xstrncpy() function call.

Thanks. However, I still want to suggest to you to include the patch and 
instructions in loop-AES-latest.tar.bz2.

&gt; However, it will not work ok with gpg encrypted key file as required by
&gt; loop-AES' multi-key mode. One would have to use two different key files, one
&gt; of those key files hidden someplace where lead pipe guys don't look.

But this would also mean vulnerability to watermark attacks, right?

If not, how would I create a boot CD which allows for manual input of 
the encrypted root partition (/dev/hda?) and keyfile at boot time?

BTW, my rootkey.gpg file is only about 4k big. How 64 keys end up taking 
so little space?

Thanks,

Christian

P.S. If someone analyses data on an multi-key mode loop-AES encrypted 
partition, can he tell for sure that it is encrypted?

Hi!

I´d just like to hear if someone ever had some files on the disk that are
not eraseable, even by root. Anyone?

It´s some time ago that I installed UT2004 and due to some openGL crap it
crashed. However, I losetuped the partition and did a fsck -f -v /dev/loop3.
Fsck found lots or errors and corrected them. I lost some files and found
some crap in the lost+found folder. Most of that was erasable with rm -r *
and away with it:-) Unfortunatley some files remained.
The astonishing thing about these is that I, as root, am not the owner of
them and second, I do not have the permission to write in the folders
containing them or to the file itself. Unbelievable, right?
Chown says that it can´t change the ownership. It´s less than 400MB so I
left it in the same folder. Fsck has no problems with this situation but I
would like to use these 400MB again.
For the interested the attachment shows an l -R of the affected area.

Regards
Peter

Hello,

it's the first time I try to use loop-aes. Since I learned from older
messages that dm-crypt is not secure, I thought I try it. The problem
is, it won't compile and I can't figure out what these errors mean.

I hope this output helps:

Hello,

sorry for not writing earlier - finally root encryption is working great 
for me for around 2 weeks, and I owe you all a very big THANK YOU!

It wasn't easy but I (as a relative Linux newbie and with help from this 
mailing list) was able to conclude it.

Now I still look for plausible deniability. I have asked earlier but I 
don't remember reading a reply about the question if someone with access 
to the HD can tell if e.g. /dev/hda2 is an encrypted partition or simply 
partitioned disk space shredded with random data.

Also, for booting from CD-R, is there some bootloader which permits to 
hide and password protect the crypto-kernel's image entry and the image 
itself, including related files (e.g. the key file)?

Later, is there a way to avoid or change the "Encrypted file system: 
please enter your passphrase" prompt?

My other concern are backups. Is it possible to use loop-AES on DVD-RW 
media? Are there any typical problems with this idea?

What do you think about adding such topics to the loop-AES README, Jari?

Thanks,

Christian

I have had such problems on a file backed loop with cryptoapi, I think it was, 
and a reiserfs file system and a crash that did involve a lockup that was X 
windows related. It was a while ago, and the solution was to tar the valuable 
data and create a new encrypted file system. I simply did not trust that 
encrypted container anymore. I've never had trouble with reiserfs and 
loop-aes.

</body></email><email><emailId>20040814133648</emailId><senderName>Philipp Marek</senderName><senderEmail>philipp@marek.priv.at</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2004-08-14 13:36:48-0400</timestampReceived><subject>RFC: ideas for a tamper-proof filesystem</subject><body>

Hello everyone!

I'd like to share some ideas about various ways to implement a tamper-proof 
filesystem for linux.

I hope to get some opinions whether the statements in this mail are valid or 
indeed sane :-).


######

As far as I can see, there are some ways to protect the data in a filesystem 
against modifications from outside.

Common to them is that some verification data (below written as vd) has to be 
stored.
That could be the IV after block-encryption, a HMAC for unencrypted devices, 
or even a error-correction code for use on buggy media (eg. floppy) (which 
would allow on-the-fly error-correction).


The main problem to solve is that the vd must match the data. If this isn't 
true the block should be rejected, and an operator probably has to be 
alerted. (This is what I mean with atomicity - vd and data must match)



I) defining a new filesystem
----------------------------


Ia) storing the vd in every data block


The idea here is to use the last n bytes of each logical block as vd area, eg. 
storing a hash there.

PRO:
 - The updates of "normal" data and vd are atomic

CON:
 - Slow, if data has to be memcpy()ed for user-space
 - Troubles with mmap
 - New filesystem needed


Ib) vd inline only in special blocks

A subvariant of this is to store vd only in "special" blocks like the 
free/used-bitmap, the inodes, and perhaps the directories; for the filedata 
we could use just 1 direct block address in the inode (with a vd for this 
block), and defining the indirect blocks to contain (block number, vd) * n + 
the vd of the indirect block.
Then for writing data the fs could look for a free block, write the data 
there, and update atomically the block number, the block's vd, and the 
indirect block's vd in one write.

PRO:
 - easier to do (as I), ext2/3 could be modified as ext4
 - not much slower (no memcpy())
 - mmap works

CON:
 - free space in fs needed
 - fragmentation
 - atomicity


II) protecting the block-device-layer, storing the vd outside the data blocks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These things could be done as a part of device-mapper.


IIa) The simple way with header blocks

For a logical block size of LB (eg. 4KB) and a vd size of VD (eg. 16B) we can 
store N=LB/VD (eg. 256) vds in a logical block (the vd-lb).
So we can precede N data blocks with one lb to store the vd.
(Or perhaps N-1, and store the vd of the vd-lb there.)

PRO:
 - works with any fs
 - locality (vd near the data)
 - a one-to-one mapping of data blocks and blocks on media

CON:
 - atomicity not guaranteed


IIb) using a flag while updating

This is like IIa, except that there is a flag in every vd-lb.
Here the idea is to
 1) write the vd-lb with the old vd's, and the flag saying "this is about to 
be modified", with a correct vd.
 2) write the "normal" data
 3) update the vd-lb with the flag cleared, and an updated vd.

If there is a non-matching vd, we allow it if the flag is set.
And we can check that at most one flag is set on a block-device.

PRO:
 - easily implemented
 - atomicity is no problem

CON:
 - doubled writes to the vd-lb (can tire the media, eg. floppy, flash memory)
 - the flag is not aestethically pleasing


IIc) a bit of journaling (sort of)
We define a header block in the block device and a field in every vd-lb.
These fields are filled with a counter, whose value is periodically written to 
the header block.

So a non-matching vd is allowed only if the counter is within a small distance 
from the header counter value.

PRO:
 - easy to do
 - atomicity solved

CON:
 - many writes to the header block


######

I'd suggest going for IIc, but I expect the experts for journaling filesystems 
can give some hints how to improve the idea.

So here's the call for ideas, comments, and suggestions.

hi,

i've a knoppix 3.4 (debin) harddisk installation. i've compilled my kernel 
2.6.6 my selfe an it was unchanged during all what i'm describing.

i've setup a loop device with AES 256 encryption. for this i've generate 
2KB random data (/dev/random) as a key. as you know /dev/random produces 
random data, not only printable text. i've used losetup with the "-p 0" 
option to get this wonking. every thing worked as expected.

then i've decided that i need "udev" and thats where my problems started. 
the APT setupup of "udev" told me that it has to remove the package 
"mount-aes". this is a knoppix propriatarie package. you may find it here: 
&lt;http://developer.linuxtag.net/knoppix/i386/&gt; after the setup my loop 
devices stoped working.

the first visible difference was that i've to user "aes-256" instead of 
"AES256" on the losetup commandline with the "-e" option. with aes-256 it 
seemd to work. no errors were showen. but the filesystem keeps unusable as 
if i've used the wrong password. then i've tried the old version of 
losetup. as expected i had to use AES256. but losetup simply stats:

ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument

please keep in mind that all this is done without changing the kernel in 
any way.

can some one please help ? i really need my data :(

TIA

&gt; However beware of the above group. Lyndon LaRouche is
&gt; the (now elderly) Hitler wannabee who has spent decades
&gt; building a cult around himself and a whacky conspiracy
&gt; based philosophy which probably he doesn't even believe.
&gt; It involves the Queen of England and others behing behind
&gt; a vast conspiracy of Nazi-Communists.

I have actually met youth movement members and read some of the
LaRouche-affiliated publications.  It is quite an over-simplification to
say that they are talking about a ``vast conspiracy of
Nazi-Communists''.  They have traced some historical processes that led
to dictatorship, nazism, and the liberal empirialism of today.  The
tradition of the British oligarchy has its role in there.  For example,
you could read Bertrand Russell's 1951 _The Impact of Science on
Society_ to see a British lord develop the ideas of a new empire based
upon psychology and sociology instead of physical power.  You can find
that he later went into science making many of his ideas publicly
accepted (as scientific truth!) today.

It is also interesting how you contend that LaRouche is a Hitler
wannabee if his organizations are spreading ideas about the beauty of
the human being and that humans are capable of discovering for
themselves universal principles upon which to base their actions instead
of being what Russell calls `cooperatives'.  Could you please provide
some arguments?

&gt; I was in one of the organizations his group attacked
&gt; 20 years ago. Of course getting the L5 Society mentioned
&gt; on US National TV as if we were part of some evil
&gt; international conspiracy did help our membership drives.
&gt; And gave us all good laughs for many years as we joked at
&gt; receptions about not finding our 'Psycho-sexual
&gt; Gratification'.

Could you provide more details on the accusations you had and later
developments?  I saw a speach by LaRouche from about 1980's, IIRC, in
which he said that humanity should work towards the colonization of
another planet and the project could be completed in 30 years.  This
seems to support the ideas and goals of the L5 Society.

&gt; He tried to take over the US Communist Party in the
&gt; 1950's using baseball bat diplomacy on Gus Hall
&gt; supporters but lost that one. He's purported, in
&gt; his youth, to have met Adolf Hitler. 
&gt; 
&gt; LaRouche went to prison in the US for a number of 
&gt; years for credit card fraud. The organization behind
&gt; him was raising a lot of money by scams. There were
&gt; even some more sinister allegations in the shadows that
&gt; his organization was involved in a death in Scandinavia.

Could you share how you know all this?

&gt; He's a very elderly nobody now and no real threat 
&gt; today other than a quadrennenial joke at US Democratic
&gt; National Conventions.

How many politicians except him do you know that have proposed any
serious economic projects (like the Eurasian Land-bridge, colonization
of other planets).  It is promising that he seems to have picked up the
idea about a large mass transportation project.

&gt; EIR does tend to get some interesting information,
&gt; the man has long been considered to have quite an
&gt; extensive private intelligence network, perhaps the
&gt; best in the world... but just be careful what else 
&gt; you are eating with the sugar.

Of course.  There also seem to be a number of independent underground
intelligence research groups.  A guy I met gave me these sites:

	wireonfire.com/donpaul
	copvcia.com
	Mikeruppert.com		[looks brand new which is suspicious]
	corpwatch.org

Anyway, we may want to take this discussion off the Linux-crypto list,

Hi!

My latest question is about that example from the aespipe.README on
encrypted CD-ROM images.
I wonder if this can be applied to DVD-ROMs and had to find out that burning
such an image.iso to a DVD ROM resulted in an error message "no medium
found".
The original command for iso-creation was:

mkisofs -r directory-tree | aespipe -w 10 -K image.iso -O 16 &gt;&gt;image.iso

I want to use a keyfile from floppy. So I changed the command like this:

mkisofs -r /safe/dvdimage | aespipe -e AES256 -K /media/floppy/keyfile.gpg
&gt;image.iso

Aespipe asked for proper password, mkisofs made an iso, everything was
fine:-) I could mount that 4GB large iso and read from it, perfect! Then I
took a DVD-ROM and burned the file under Windows XP with Nero 6.0. The
result was a DVD-ROM that neither the recorder nor my DVD drive could
read:-(
I suppose the problem comes from the filesystem creation. DVD-ROMs should be
different from the ISO9660 standard. Maybe mkisofs shouldn´t be run with the
-r option. But, which option is the right one at that point???

Has somebody allready successfully made an encrypted DVD-ROM? What´s the
right command for the image creation? Which option do I have to consider in
the recording software (k3b, nero, etc.)???
Any hints, either for creation of an encrypted DVD image or saving a 4GB
encrypted file on DVD, are welcome.

Btw., is there a patch in progress for that new gpg-release 1.2.6
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.2.6.tar.bz2
and the util-linux package 2.12b? I just found those but couldn´t apply the
loop-aes 2.1c patches to them.

Peter

&gt; I am. Do you happen to know where I can find blueprints of the

The documents mentioned in the eJournal article are

	NACSIM 5100A, a document which has been classified by the
	National Security Agency
	
Wim van Eck
	Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An
	Eavesdropping Risk?
	"Computers &amp; Security" journal, vol 4 (4) pp 269-286, published
	in 1985.
	
	The paper caused a panic in certain government circles and was
	immediately classified as is just about all TEMPEST information.

Also near the end of the article:

	I believe the media should be made aware of the problem in hope
	that publicity about potential TEMPEST attacks will force the
	government to release the information necessary to allow private
	citizens and industry the means to properly secure their
	proprietary data.

Which indicates that the standards, blue-prints and other information is
most probably still classified.  I believe US law requires that the van
Eck article be declassified by 2005 (20 years after classification).

Until then, you can develop your own version of a TEMPEST eavesdropping
device, because the basic idea is in the eJournal article.  If you know
basic electrodynamics, you would know that the magnetic induction
(field) intensity B is proportional to the current that generates it (in
this case --- the electon beam in the CRT).  Thus, you need a directed
antenna that tells you B as a function of time.  Then, a high-resolution
clock will help you tell where on the screan the electon beam was to
produce a pixel (knowing --- or finding by trial and error --- the
horizontal and vertical refresh rates, the dot clock time and a few
other temporal parameters).  Thus, you only need to convert B to color
intensity and use the clock to reconstruct the location of a pixel.
This is for a black-and-white screen or for a single color component of
an RGB screen.  You shold be able to figure out the rest on your own.

Alternatively, you could try contacting spyking at thecodex.com.

Anyway, the only way to security is to make sure society serves the
principles of the universe, and not financially powerful empires built
on empiricism,

There are also many excellent papers on the net about
optical tempest. Very interesting reading and probably
not very difficult for the hobbyist to build.

haven_t treid this yes as this will break my udev setup. i'be used the

i've installed: util-linux-2.12a.tar.gz patched with loop-AES-v2.1c wiht 
out any success :((

losetup -e AES256 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /cf/xcf0

works but filesystem in /dev/loop0 stays unusable ...

What was the exact losetup syntax you used with mount-aes version of
losetup?

Can you try adding one of these options to losetup?

-H rmd160
-H unhashed1
-H unhashed2

I quickly looked but didn't find mount-aes sources. But inspecting losetup
binary looked like it was from old version of loop-AES.

If all other attempts fail, you can still wget the binary package, and
extract the files of the package to some directory, something like this:

    dpkg -x mount-aes_2.11x-1_i386.deb z
    ./z/sbin/losetup -e AES256 .........whatever

i've tried all available losetup binaries without scuccess. with some 
combinations of losetup and aes-256/AES256 i get the folloeing errors with 
losetup:

Unsupported encryption type aes-256

any further suggestion ?

Kernel support is missing. Your kernel does not have loop module from
loop-AES package. If you use old or new losetup from loop-AES package and
kernel module from latest loop-AES package, it should work ok.

again - it used to work! my kenrnel has loop-aes support. but any way, what

the loop-AES-v2.1c source ? did i get you right ??

Simply recompile your current 2.6.6 (or whatever) using
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=n in kernel config and build new loop.ko module. See
section 3 of loop-AES' README file for more instructions.

Or, maybe loop module just fails to load automatically. Can you try first
loading the module to kernel using modprobe:

jari, i've done this "a few" time bevor - i think, i know how to handle it 
- but now i've a real problem :(  ... my testscript looks like this:


modprobe cryptoloop 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null
modprobe aes 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null

losetup -d /dev/loop0
echo $PW | $GPG | /sbin/losetup -e aes-256 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /cf/xcf0

yust to test all available (4) versions of losetup - in this case with 
"aes-256" - in an easy to handle maner ... i've tested this wiht AES256 
too. and each and every time the mount fails :((

i've rebooted to get a clean system. when using the loop.ko form loop-AES 
and utils with the patch form loop-aes and i try to do a losetup like this:

echo $PW | $GPG | ./losetup -e AES256 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /cf/xcf0

i get:

ioctl: LOOP_CLR_FD: No such device or address

but when i do "losetup -a" i get:

/dev/loop0: [0303]:7454729 (/cf/xcf0) encryption=AES256

but /dev/loop0 is still unusable :((((


by now i really NEED my data :(((

Above looks like loop.ko module was compiled for wrong kernel configuration.

After you compile your kernel, you need to compile loop.ko without moving or
cleaning compiled kernel source tree. Something like this:

    cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.6
    mv .config z
    make distclean
    mv z .config
    make oldconfig
    make dep &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make bzImage
    make modules &amp;&amp; make modules_install
    cat arch/i386/boot/bzImage &gt;/boot/vmlinuz
    cp System.map /boot/System.map-2.6.6

    cd /usr/src/loop-AES-v2.1c
    make LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux-2.6.6

If you are using lilo bootloader, you need to run lilo:

    lilo

And then reboot to new kernel /boot/vmlinuz

Just another hint: Ensure you are compiling the loop module with
the same compiler used for the kernel compilation.
(It took me some time to figure out I was compiling the module with
gcc-3.3.3 and kernel was compiled with 2.95.3).

finaly i found the solution. reviewing the source dir on my disk i found 
the following directory:

util-linux-2.12

dated just the time of my initial setup. now i know, that i've to write 
down every importatant configuration step i do. with the losetup found in 
this dir every ting works as expected. you may find the sorurce at 
www.mhcsoftware.de/ul212.tar.gz if you want to have a look at it.

i use this losetup with the "cryptoloop" and "aes" module of the 2.6.6 
kernel.

now here are my quetions - because i want to understand this:

- what is the difference between "cryptoloop" of the kernel and "loop-aes" ?

- why are they incomaptible ? or better, are the incompatible ? and if so, 
why ?

- and finaly - if they are incomatible - why are there different 
implementations and what is the difference ?


well the core question is: what should i use and why.


thank for your persistant support and your patience !!!!

cheers

although this works for you, it still is a bad idea. see below.

please have a look at http://mareichelt.de/pub/texts.cryptoloop.php

I took the liberty and originally wrote that text for some friends,
...so it has been written in a err ... populistic way ;) so please
bare with me. It also needs an update...

But there is no point in using mainline cryptoloop if one takes
security seriously.

&gt; I'd like to share some ideas about various ways to implement a tamper-proof 
&gt; filesystem for linux.

Do you mean a trip-wire-like protection of the file system, or are you
concerned with media failure only?

&gt; I hope to get some opinions whether the statements in this mail are valid or 
&gt; indeed sane :-).

That's what humanity is about.

&gt; ######
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I can see, there are some ways to protect the data in a filesystem 
&gt; against modifications from outside.
&gt; 
&gt; Common to them is that some verification data (below written as vd) has to be 
&gt; stored.
&gt; That could be the IV after block-encryption, a HMAC for unencrypted devices, 
&gt; or even a error-correction code for use on buggy media (eg. floppy) (which 
&gt; would allow on-the-fly error-correction).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The main problem to solve is that the vd must match the data. If this isn't 
&gt; true the block should be rejected, and an operator probably has to be 
&gt; alerted. (This is what I mean with atomicity - vd and data must match)

For protection against malicios data modification, the tricky part is
also to integrate every vd record (or group of vd blocks) with all other
encrypted data (a modification of a vd needs to lead to a major,
detectable modification of all encrypted data, or at least a specificly
designed sensitive part of it).  Otherwise, a commonly known problem is
that someone who was able to obtain an earlier copy of the encrypted
data can extract a block (or a group of blocks that share the same vd /
vd's group) from the earlier copy can substitute it in the new version
of the encrypted volume, thus modifying a part of the encrypted data
without being detected.

&gt; I) defining a new filesystem
&gt; ----------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ia) storing the vd in every data block

Vulnerable as described above.  Already discussed a little on this list.

&gt; II) protecting the block-device-layer, storing the vd outside the data blocks
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; These things could be done as a part of device-mapper.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; IIa) The simple way with header blocks
&gt; 
&gt; For a logical block size of LB (eg. 4KB) and a vd size of VD (eg. 16B) we can 
&gt; store N=LB/VD (eg. 256) vds in a logical block (the vd-lb).
&gt; So we can precede N data blocks with one lb to store the vd.
&gt; (Or perhaps N-1, and store the vd of the vd-lb there.)

As mentioned earlier on the list, grouping vd's and keeping a vd of vd's
is one solution of the problem mentioned above.

Good luck and watch out (By the way are people here interested in
TEMPEST, e.g.
&lt;http://bss.sfsu.edu/fischer/IR%20360/Readings/tempest.htm&gt;?),

loop-aes on device-backed loop is reliable enough. I wouldnt trust

Yes. Thank´s! That solved my problems with just a few typing.
Fsck had set some attributes and chattr could reset them so that the files
became accessible/eraseable again.
The partition is device backed and I don´t think this error was caused by
loop-aes. The crash(s) caused it and the only question would be which file
system is the most solid. With ext2 / ext3 I think I made the right choice.


Thanks for the quick and usefull help!

Hello!

My aes256 partition again:
After MPlayer freezed and I had to make a reset fsck ruined my SuSE
installation. One hour later SuSE 9.1 64-bit plus loop-aes were ready again.
This time I checked that data partition with fsck -f -v /dev/loop4 and saw
horrible things:-(
Fsck truncates files and folders. My 80gb dvdrip folder seems to be gone
forever. I made such experiences bevor, but why does this happend? Ext2 is
said to be "rock solid", isn´t it? Loop-aes says something about wirte cache
on harddisks. Which command deactivates harddisk caching? Is it helpfull to
add a "sync" in /etc/fstab for each harddisk partition?
What about other filesystems? Some people here use xfs or jfs. Are these
more resistant to hang ups / resets?

Regards,
Peter

ext3 file system may be more resistant to unclean shutdowns than ext2.

For ATA disks, writeback cache can be turned off using
"hdparm -W 0 /dev/hda" and "hdparm -I /dev/hda" queries status.

I used ext3 for the data partition mentioned and ext2 for root partition. As
far as I can see the problem occures because of data that is still in RAM
while the PC hangs up. In this way RAM and disk show a difference, files are
not propperly closed/written. Typing "sync" in the bash from time to time
reduces the amount of faults found by fsck after a lock up. So I added sync
to my /etc/fstab.
The above "hdparm -W 0" might solve the problem totally. Is this write cache
turn off permanent? If not, in which boot script can I add the command? I
suppose this change will reduce harddisk performance a little bit, right?
Then a short question to "fsck". With the -b option I can make use of a
backup inode to restore journal informations. Is that a good idea? As there
are plenty of these backup inodes which one should I use?
Mounting the encrypted partition as it is there is missing one folder
completely. Are there chances that fsck might restore it?
I´ll try soon and give a report on that.

hdparm needs to be called with each reboot.

Some distributions include an /etc/init.d/hdparm script
(and /etc/hdparm.conf).  If these exist, use them to turn off the write
cache.  If they don't exist, place the hdparm command in an init script
before most partitions are mounted (i.e., in a new script before the
mountall executes, or at the top of the mountall script).  (As an
example, my Debian system has mountall placed as @S35 in the script
order, and I placed a script I made, mountloop, as @S34 in the script
order; mountloop calls hdparm, and then does special prep work for
encrypted swap or /tmp.)

"hdparm -W 0 /dev/hda" solves only the case when power is lost unexpectedly.
If computer crashes, but hard disk still gets power from UPS or laptop
batteries, hard disk can complete queued writes successfully.

Enabled hard disk write cache is not necessarily the cause of your file
system corruption. When your box crashes, and openGL/X-server/kernel-drm
starts writing to kernel RAM locations they should not modify, then such
crash may well cause serious file system damage.

&gt; Is this write cache turn off permanent?

Probably not.

&gt; If not, in which boot script can I add the command?

On SUSE, maybe you can create new boot script:

/etc/init.d/boot.d/S01myhdparm.sh

&gt; I suppose this change will reduce harddisk performance a little bit, right?

Write performance will suffer badly.

Said in brief, when my box crashes anything can happen and best I can do is
to push the reset button as fast as I can, right?
Yes, it must have been the X-server because MPlayer stuck up but the
harddrive didn´t stop.
Is there any cure to prevent crashing apps from writing into my kernel RAM
and corrupting my filesystem?

&gt; On SUSE, maybe you can create new boot script:
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose this change will reduce harddisk performance a little bit,
&gt; right?
&gt; 
&gt; Write performance will suffer badly.

I tried "hdparm -W 0 /dev/hda". You can switch on and off the write cache.
hdparm -I gives detailed information. Problem is, when write cache is off
writing rates drop to 1/10 of normal performance. So that´s not a help.

Btw, I could convince fsck.ext3 to connect some data with the lost+found
folder. As I could see about 80GB were restored there. Problem is that the
directory name are numerical now, some filenames also. So that means either
work to arrange it again or just data loss. However, it´s impressive to see
what fsck can do.

Is there a way to make some testing? I mean to cause a crash and look
whether it gets better by adding "sync" to the fstab? So far I tried with
the reset button, but that´s just powerloss and not a crash. On ext3 fs
would the crash be reversible if only I replay the journal?
With regard to the data partition it would be an idea to just mount it
readonly when starting openGL games.

Ok, thanks for your attention.

Peter

Userspace apps can't write directly to kernel RAM, but if you are using
buggy kernel driver, or driver compiled from wrong kernel configuration,
anything can happen.

Does your openGL version install any kernel drivers?

Mounting it read-only may help, but something is seriusly wrong with

IMO, correct fix is stop using such crashing drivers or upgrade/recompile
them to better match your kernel config.

&gt;

My openGL support comes from
http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/1.0-6111/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-1.0-6111-pkg2.run.
It´s a 7MB package from Nvidia that gives SuSE 9.1 64-bit hardware
acceleration and open GL. I need it to play dvds / xvids on MPlayer.
This shell-script does whatever it wants to. To my knowledge a module named
"nvidia.o" is compiled and loaded. lsmod shows a module named nvidia so
that´s for sure not a userspace app.

Using some openGL app is one sure way to make the PC hang or stutter. For
instance glxgears runs fine appart from some stops. I don´t mind these
problems that much because I am not dependent on 3D Games or screensavers.
Anyway a crash can allways happen. The thing is that a crash should not be
that devastating to smash a whole filesystem. Fsck should be able to fix the
occuring errors.
 
&gt; Mounting the file system or running fsck.ext3 should replay the journal.

I don´t know what happens when mounting an ext3-fs. You have to mount it
with mount -v to see a journal replay message, right?
The crash happens when I start openGL games or the box gets overheated on
hot days and heavy load. Transcode makes intensive use of the cpu for 12 and
more hours.
When it comes to upgrade / recompile I can only say that I use the most
recent openGL driver from Nvidia and my config is the most closest possible
to SuSE 9.1 64-bit. I didn´t upgrade the kernel, so it is still 2.6.4-52
with the changes needed to put it on a USB stick and boot the box with
loop-aes.
If someone reading this has experience with ATI graphics cards on SuSE I´d
like to read about it! I do not know which hardware manufacturer offers
better support.

Peter

To be honest, while it's possible that the nvidia driver is crashing your
machine, it sounds more like flaky other hardware - CPU, fan, heatsink,
memory etc. Check the fan and heatsink are well attached to the CPU, with
enough of the grease to conduct the heat out.

Ugh. I have seen too many (not loop-AES related) postings where nvidia
kernel module is blamed for crashing the kernel.

If you can reproduce this crash without nvidia kernel module loaded to
kernel, then I will take an another look at this. Otherwise, this is waste
of my time.

try to avoid "very" special characters, char-mapping is voodoo anyway.
also they can increase the amount of time of brute-force attacks, you

think about it: which program gets your passphrase? gpg? does gpg have
an interface (i.e. an cmdline option) for a "2nd passphrase"? if so, the
manpage needs updating.

What is the communication process, who are the different key players in this

this has nothing to do with AES and it is still unclear if my suspicion
regarding "strange characters" is responsible for your problem here. try
the same thing with /usr/bin/passwd and see if it is accepting "strange
chacacters".

Hello,

I am trying to do some experiment on compression ratios with cloop. I 
know that currently cloop uses zlib. How can I change it to other 
algorithms? Where should I start from? Really a newbie to this, 
appreciate any comments!!

TIA.

Multi-key mode needs util-linux patch from loop-AES-v2.0b or later.

Not really. It's a general list. Just hasn't been a lot of
chatter on cryptoapi here lately. Used to be a lot more.
 
&gt; You want to ask the CryptoAPI people your question; try sending mail to 
&gt; cryptoapi-devel@kerneli.org

That's the developer specific list that was spun off
to focus strictly on the kernel api... although it 
does also handle the non-kernel side.

Hasn't been a lot of discussion lately. I think Herbert
has been very busy with a new job and hasn't stuck his
head up in a long time.

&gt; Ugh. I have seen too many (not loop-AES related) postings where nvidia
&gt; kernel module is blamed for crashing the kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can reproduce this crash without nvidia kernel module loaded to
&gt; kernel, then I will take an another look at this. Otherwise, this is waste
&gt; of my time.

Oh, I am sorry. I didn´t intent to waste your time. Most times when I have a
problem I will get a hint here.
However, this recent crash didn´t happen because of overheating or a buggy
loop.ko. I didn´t blame loop-AES for that. Bevor, I didn´t think about the
nvidia.o to cause a crash at all because the package is easy to install and
looks for the kernel-source and config to compile a fitting module. 

Regards,
Peter

Hello 

I read, that loop-AES uses for example  
256bit hash of user password for 128bit key algorithm.

How do the 256bits correspond to the smaller key ? Is it a way , that 
it makes any difference vs. using 128 bit hash ?

JR&gt; loop-AES needs full recompiled kernel sources there. It won't work properly
JR&gt; with kernel headers only source package.

Ok - I tried with the option make LINUX_SOURCE, pointed to the full
Kernel sources and that gave me even more errors, pages over pages. I
found some debian packages with wajig:
http://hinterhof.net/debian/

Now, I did some of the examples and everything works nicely. I still
have one question about security. Let's assume I use multi-key mode,
like in "7.2. Example 2 - Partition backed loop with gpg
encrypted key file".

The key file is on that server. Isn't that a huge security risk, like
when your private PGP key leaks out? What if someone get's access to
that gpg keyfile? Is password only mode better for servers that are
housed in a data center? But that is considered insecure? I'm a little
confused now.

Examples in loop-AES README use symmetric cipher only to encrypt the key
file, but nothing prevents you from using public key crypto to encrypt the
key file.

Attacker still need to know the passphrase that protects the key file or
private key keyring. As long as attacker does not have that, key file
contents are protected. Best solution is to store key file on removable
USB memory stick.

It really had to do with keymaps. % $ ! work cause they seem to be at

&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks. I suggest to add these 2 questions and answers to the loop-AES
&gt;&gt;&gt;README
&gt; mind to send a patch?

It wouldn't be a lot of text, and I think that Jari would prefer his 
wording. He would have to verify it anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and also possibly some observation about characters which should
&gt;&gt;&gt;be avoided in the passphrase.
&gt; this has nothing to do with AES and it is still unclear if my suspicion
&gt; regarding "strange characters" is responsible for your problem here. try
&gt; the same thing with /usr/bin/passwd and see if it is accepting "strange
&gt; chacacters".

It has nothing to do with AES but it is related to it, and can cause a 
lot of headache.

Thanks,

Christian

I don't remember anyone complaining about that.

"It could be both" (If you know what I think of :-)

&gt; For protection against malicios data modification, the tricky part is
&gt; also to integrate every vd record (or group of vd blocks) with all other
&gt; encrypted data (a modification of a vd needs to lead to a major,
&gt; detectable modification of all encrypted data, or at least a specificly
&gt; designed sensitive part of it).  Otherwise, a commonly known problem is
&gt; that someone who was able to obtain an earlier copy of the encrypted
&gt; data can extract a block (or a group of blocks that share the same vd /
&gt; vd's group) from the earlier copy can substitute it in the new version
&gt; of the encrypted volume, thus modifying a part of the encrypted data
&gt; without being detected.
Then I believe it would be necessary to integrate the encryption in the 
filesystem, so that some special blocks can be used to verify the integrity.
ie. have every block signed by some other, up to some "top" blocks which 
certify the tree-structure downwards.

Of course, if all blocks of this device are just saved and later restored, no 
change can be found.


Thank you for the answer.

However beware of the above group. Lyndon LaRouche is
the (now elderly) Hitler wannabee who has spent decades
building a cult around himself and a whacky conspiracy
based philosophy which probably he doesn't even believe.
It involves the Queen of England and others behing behind
a vast conspiracy of Nazi-Communists.

I was in one of the organizations his group attacked
20 years ago. Of course getting the L5 Society mentioned
on US National TV as if we were part of some evil
international conspiracy did help our membership drives.
And gave us all good laughs for many years as we joked at
receptions about not finding our 'Psycho-sexual
Gratification'.

He tried to take over the US Communist Party in the
1950's using baseball bat diplomacy on Gus Hall
supporters but lost that one. He's purported, in
his youth, to have met Adolf Hitler. 

LaRouche went to prison in the US for a number of 
years for credit card fraud. The organization behind
him was raising a lot of money by scams. There were
even some more sinister allegations in the shadows that
his organization was involved in a death in Scandinavia.

He's a very elderly nobody now and no real threat 
today other than a quadrennenial joke at US Democratic
National Conventions.

EIR does tend to get some interesting information,
the man has long been considered to have quite an
extensive private intelligence network, perhaps the
best in the world... but just be careful what else 
you are eating with the sugar.

&gt; 
&gt; Could you provide more details on the accusations you had and later
&gt; developments?  I saw a speach by LaRouche from about 1980's, IIRC, in
&gt; which he said that humanity should work towards the colonization of
&gt; another planet and the project could be completed in 30 years.  This
&gt; seems to support the ideas and goals of the L5 Society.

At the time L5 Society was the premier Space Settlement organization
(We are now National Space Society and I am part of the leadership
still); LaRouche had decided he wanted that territory, and on one
of his hour long TV prime time purchases, he spoke darkly of the
'organizations like the L5 Society' in terms that were a ludicrous
smear. A lot of members were really quite worried and wondered
what the hell was going on and who the guy was. So myself and 
another one of the Society leaders started researching him and
 got loads of data. Since that was back in 1982 or thereabouts, all that
material is in storage which I cannot get to. But I had loads
of stuff, including getting my hands on a very thick report from
another private intelligence group who were sympathetic to
the fact that this fruitcake was calling us names on national
TV. 
 
&gt; &gt; He tried to take over the US Communist Party in the
&gt; &gt; 1950's using baseball bat diplomacy on Gus Hall
&gt; &gt; supporters but lost that one. He's purported, in
&gt; &gt; his youth, to have met Adolf Hitler. 

From the report mentioned above which I can't access at the
moment. There was even more which I did not mention.

&gt; &gt; LaRouche went to prison in the US for a number of 
&gt; &gt; years for credit card fraud. The organization behind
&gt; &gt; him was raising a lot of money by scams. 

Well that should be easy to google. I'm having trouble
remembering exactly when he got caught and convicted,
but it was on TV news at the time, late 80's I would
guess, and a lot of us were relieved to see him out
of circulation. I was particularly worried when I ran
an international space  conference in Pittsburgh and
had lots of CAP kids watching for any problems, particularly
when I had General Danny Graham speaking on Space Defense,
another issue LL was trying to co-opt.

&gt; &gt; There were even some more sinister allegations in the shadows that
&gt; &gt; his organization was involved in a death in Scandinavia.
&gt; Could you share how you know all this?

It was stated much more strongly in that report, but I toned
it down to allegations because I can't get at the original 
files now.
 
&gt; How many politicians except him do you know that have proposed any
&gt; serious economic projects (like the Eurasian Land-bridge, colonization
&gt; of other planets).  It is promising that he seems to have picked up the
&gt; idea about a large mass transportation project.

Well, there was Newt Gingritch who spoke at our 2nd Space Development
Conference and was part of the Space Caucus in congress. In 1983 he
wanted to have the Year 2000 Christmas turned on with power beamed
from a solar power satellite... and what was better, he wasn't 
trying to associate us with some dark forces of evil. 

&gt; Of course.  There also seem to be a number of independent underground
&gt; intelligence research groups.  A guy I met gave me these sites:
&gt; 
&gt; 	wireonfire.com/donpaul
&gt; 	copvcia.com
&gt; 	Mikeruppert.com		[looks brand new which is suspicious]
&gt; 	corpwatch.org

His has been around for far, far longer. There are other rumours that
he got some connections into the White House in the 1990's via a
certain loose cannon who was involved with intelligence there. So
said a friend of mine, but I'm skeptical.

&gt; Anyway, we may want to take this discussion off the Linux-crypto list,

And in any case, I've got far too much to do right now, so
I'll close out with this post.

Any chance of you testing attached patch that attempts to fix two possible

I made encrypted a pair of disks using loop-AES on Debian Woody. I 
recently formatted my system disk to Gentoo. I saved the encryption 
keys for the other disk. The script I had written called for this:

  losetup -e aes -k 128 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /dev/hde &gt; /keyfile

  In other words, create a loopback device based on this hard disk and 
unencrypt it using the AES cipher and the contents of "keyfile" which 
is a 128 bit key.

So what I did after I installed Gentoo was download the freshest 
util-linux and aes-loop. I patched util-linux and compiled with no 
problem and I was able to make and install loop.ko with no problem as 
well. I compiled my kernel without loopback support as called for by 
install docs, and loaded loop.ko using

  modprobe loop

  modprobe -l verifies that it is loaded.

So far so good. The problem is that this version of losetup no longer 
takes the -k option and I can't remember what version I was using 
before. I also can't remember if I used patched util-linux or something 
else. Okay, so i changed "aes" to "aes-128". Now I enter the command:

  losetup -e aes-128 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /dev/hde &gt; /keyfile

  I get no errors, but when I try to mount loop0 I get told that it 
can't find a filesystem on the device. Is this a problem with the 
"offset"? Why have the parameters of this program changed? I'm not sure 
what's going on here. In fact, I don't even really know if it is the 
kernel, the binary or my configuration that is screwing things up for 
me and don't know how to tell.

What I am actually trying to head towards here eventually is accessing 
these drives using dm-crypt. Are these even compatible?

Hi All ...

I have been playing arround with loopAES for quite some time
now and I love it. The ability to boot from a removeable media
such as a CD or a USB plus the strength of loopAES GPG protected multi-key
is fantastic.

I was now trying to get loop AES working on a soft raid, but i don't
seam to get very far.

ext2 on loopAES on singel disk works fine
ext2 on md0 works fine too

but ext2 on loopAES on md0 causes a seg fault

Before I seriously start looking into why this dosn't work,
I'd like to know if there is anyone else out there
that got loopAES on soft raid working.

thankx ...

Hi,

I'd like to add simple support to cryptoapi for a certain on-cpu
hardware encryption unit.

There seem to be no current hardware API in cryptoapi, but doing at
least a semi hackish job of seems not too hard: just define a
`cipher_implementation' with appropriate methods that invoke the
hardware.

My question is about the `_atomic' variants (e.g. encrypt_atomic) -- the
IPSEC implementation only uses these so it seems necessary to implement
them, but the definition of `struct cipher_implementation' contains a
comment which says that "atomic" implies both `will never sleep' and
`always SW implementation'.

I'm wondering why the documentation includes the `always SW
implementation' constraint.

In my case, using hardware seems safe enough because:

 * The hardware in question seems reasonably fast (17 cycles for a DES
   block encryption), so it doesn't seem a problem not to sleep -- it
   should be faster than the SW implementation anyway (er, I think,
   anyway, from looking at the routines).

 * Though the encryption hardware is stateful, as long as my
   encryption/etc routines are never invoked from an interrupt context,
   I can just sure things are set up correctly and assume I have sole
   access until I return (SMP shouldn't be an issue because it's an
   on-CPU unit, and anyway probably nobody would ever use this CPU in
   such a configuration :-)

So I'm hoping I can just treat this as a funny CPU instruction and do
the simple thing.  E.g. put BUG_ON (in_interrupt()) in my routines, etc.

Can anybody offer advice  about this?  Am I safe assuming I won't get
called from an interrupt context?  Are there other pitfalls I don't see?

Apologies if this seems clueless, I just started looking at this stuff...

Thanks,

-Miles

Dear mailing list readers,

I have spent the last days to evaluate whole disk encryption possibilities
under Linux. As far as I know there are 3 ways: cryptoloop, dm-crypt and
loop-aes.

My task is to backup gigabytes of medical and financial data stored on a
couple of smb file servers to a remote machine, whose security is unknown.
Lets assume the worst case that the crypto container on this backup machines
is world readable. I will use rsync, so only changes of the crypto container
are transferred on a daily basis.

It appears to me that loop-aes is the only one choice under linux with real
secure implementation of strong encryption. However, I am no crypto analyst
and would love to read some professional comments about loop-aes. So, my
first question is, if somebody knows a link to a document which deals with
this?

Also, I have questions related to file backed loop-aes encryption.

If I use ext3 on top of a file backed loop device, I understand that the
consistency is in danger because writes are reordered of the underlying fs.
What I dont understand is the claim, that ext3 (top) &lt;-&gt; loop-aes &lt;-&gt; ext3
(underlying with data=ordered or data=journal) should work. Why is the
assumption correct that the underlying ext3 preserves the same write order
of the ext3 on top?

I found some other notes about deadlocks while using file backed loop-aes.
On Linux Kernel mailing list it is claimed that GFP_NOFS is cause of
deadlocks. Ext3 uses this call, ext2 not. The author of loop-aes just used
the phrase "it should maybe work" if ext2 is fs on top. So, does somebody of
you know the stability of this scenario (file backed loop-aes with ext2 on
top) on production servers?

The reason I dont want to use device backed loop-aes is the dependency from
the block device. If I use file backed loop-aes and one server crashes, I
can just copy the crypto container as file to to an arbitrary fs created on
a i.e. a ide, scsi-blockdevice or even software raid of a new server. I
think I wouldnt have this functionality if I backup the (ide-,scsi- or
software raid-) block device with "dd" (maybe I am wrong?).

Kind regards,
A.Engels

Hi All,

I've been reading a lot of information regarding dm-crypt and crytoloop 
vulnerability to known-plaintext and watermark attacks.  I was wondering 
if the following dm-crypt setup method would solve the known-plaintext 
attack:

1. Encryption key generation and encryption using GPG:

head -c 32 /dev/urandom &gt; secure.key
gpg -c --cipher-algo AES256 secure.key

2. Secure volume creation using dm-crypt:

/usr/bin/gpg -q --cipher-algo AES256 --decrypt secure.key.gpg | \
	/usr/local/bin/cryptsetup create secure_dev /dev/hdaX


The secure volume could then be mounted with:

/bin/mount /dev/mapper/secure_dev /mnt/secure

You could still compute a dictionary for a known-plaintext attack but 
being that the keylength is 256-bit and the key is essentially random 
(assuming good entropy from /dev/urandom) then the dictionary would be 
infeasibly large (perhaps even for a government organisation).

Questions:

1. Are there any problems with this method (apart from the danger of 
losing 'secure.key.gpg')?

2. What are the consequences of a section of the encrypted volume being 
corrupted? does dm-crypt use CBC or is each block encrypted individually 
resulting in only localised data loss through corruption?

3. Is it safe to use XFS with this setup?

4. I don't believe it does solve a watermark attack - what work-arounds 
would solve this?

Kind Regards,

Andrew

I have a machine with an encrypted root filesystem on kernel 2.4.22 with

2.6.6 ). Since loop-AES-v2.1b has a kernel patch for 2.6.6 I was

to make changes to the initrd.gz and all the modified binaries, or will
just the patched kernel work (it doesn't seem to).
I am just worried about making to many changes, and locking myself out

Hi guys,

2 years ago I configured an encrypted filesystem on my RH9 server 
following the instructions on QVADIS website:

http://www.q-vadis.net/index.php?mID=stories&amp;lng=en&amp;art=5

today I migrated the serve to Taolinux 1.0 http://www.taolinux.org (it's 
basically a RHEL rebuild)

and I'm totally screwed :(

I spent a few hours reading newsgroup posts and crypto related 
informations, tried diffeent falvors and combination of patched on 
util-linux but unfortunately I wasnt able to sort things up.

---

My last try was using the latest util-linux v2.12 + loop-aes v2.1b:

./losetup -e aes-256 -H rmd160 /dev/loop0 /glcrypto
Password:

Passwords shorter than 20 characters are considered too short and insecure.
Use of rmd160 password hash permits use of such short passwords for

Hopefully this message is annoying enough that you discontinue using such
short passwords.

I'm quite lost, considering on this box I would like to stay with

Hello,

my installed version of util-linux is 2.12-72. There is a file called 
loop-AES-v2.0f-util-linux-2.12.diff in /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/. Can I 
use this one, or should I use a newer version? Where do I get it and how 
do I avoid messing up with YaST?

There also is a README.loop-AES-v2.0f.SuSE file saying that "to enhance 
the feature of mount, umount, losetup, swapon and swapoff we have 
included the patch to util-linux-2.12 from Jari Ruusu's loop-AES 
package". Does that mean that I don't have to patch anything?

Also, after the make command I cannot find any loop.o or loop.ko file. 
My kernel version is 2.6.5-7.95. Does it matter in which directory I 
execute "make" and "make tests"?

BTW, is someone aware of a distribution offering a swap + root 
encryption option at installation?

And how do I verify for sure which kernel has been loaded? (I'm asking 
this beause even after choosing my new compiled kernel at the grub boot 
menu, the last line before login says that the default kernel was loaded 
- if this is a bug, how do I fix it?)

Thanks,

Christian

P.S. Does a patched gnupg make sense even if my passphrase is composed 
of over 20 quite alleatory characters?

Hi,

is there some IRC channel about filesystem crypto and/or loop-AES?

Or perhaps some channels where someone likely would be able to help 
(after "make tests" succeeded I'm slowly progressing with root encryption).

And is there a FAQ for this list?

It could also be a good idea to make the archives of this list searchable.

Thanks,

You bring up something I have been meaning to ask for a long time, but
keep forgetting: my hard drive is encrypted using single-key mode. What
is the recommended way of re-encrypting using multi-key mode? Does it
require booting with a rescue disk (Knoppix, for example) and using
aespipe? Any pitfalls to look for?

When I started using loop-AES it did not support multi-key mode so my
only option at the time was single-key, but now that we multi-key I'd
like to increase the security of my setup.

Thanks!

Hello Jari (&amp; list members),

"man swapon" says: "If loop=/dev/loop? and encryption=AES128 options are 
present in /etc/fstab then swapon -a will set up loop devices using 
random keys..."

I hope this is also true for encryption=AES256 ? Possibly you may want 
to add this to your great README.

Is there also a way to check that encrypted swap is working? And is it 
possible to suspend to disk with root encryption?

Further, in your README, at example 7.6, 1-6), is it possible that you 
forgot to add "with exception that in step 2 you must copy aespipe to 
/boot/iso "?

In my second last e-mail answered by you, you didn't comment on my 
question (which I'm reformulating here and in the next paragraph) wheter 
a non-patched gpg would represent a big weakness.

In your README, you assign security level 1 to "gpg encrypted 
'multi-key' key file and/or gpg public+private keys are stored on 
separate removable USB dongle that is not available to attacker." You 
also write that "if USB dongle and its key files are available to 
attacker, security level is equivalent to level 2." By which factor 
would you say that level 2 is less secure than level 1?

Anyway, as some say that the NSA is always about 10 years ahead of us, 
what do you believe are the chances that they already found a way to 
crack your crypto implementation?

Going even further - which ways do exist to set up dual-cipher encryption?

Many thanks,

Christian

P.S. I also want to thank Venkat for his answer.

 &gt; "cat /proc/swaps" command should show one or more lines starting with

Unfortunately it does not (it mentions /dev/hda5). What else could I do?

In /etc/fstab (loop=/dev/loop?), I can replace ? with any number from 0 
to 7, right?

I discovered that SuSE seems to ignore what comes after the word 
default, if you simply append something. When I boot 
2.6.5-7.95-default-neo1, uname -a returns 2.6.5-7.95-default. However, 
when I boot 2.6.5-7.95-defneo1, uname -a returns 2.6.5-7.95-defneo1.

There is no such thing as point and click root encryption on Linux yet. We 
have started offering Installed Secure laptops, servers etc. with Loop-AES 
encryption with Gentoo, SuSE, Mandrake and Debian. 

We follow good installation procedures, use firewalls, disable all but needed 
services, use qmail and any keys we generate remain only on the customers 
computers/USB keys. We plan to provide detailed information on a wiki (if you 
need more information than Jari's comprehensive Readme) for anyone wanting to 
do it themselves - which is the best way, you don't have to trust a third 
party  (other than the code). We also sell hardware without operating 
systems.

We are also offering UML hosting with Loop-AES encrypted data partition (on a 
file backed virtual disk). Customers can generate their own keys and move 
them in and out via ssh. Our site runs in such an UML instance.

Laptops: http://www.rayservers.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=21
UML Hosting: http://www.rayservers.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=28

We hope to grow rapidly and are adding product to our site as fast as we can.

Jari, many thanks for your excellent work and I hope that the mainline 
cryptoloop is eventually replaced with Loop-AES. I have tried many 
combinations including file backed containers inside an encrypted partition 
without problems (despite seeing your warnings about file backed containers). 

Speaking of which, it would be great if pam_mount and loop-aes could be used 
together in multi-key mode. Single key mode with openssl encrypted random 
keys using the login password for automatically mounted file backed 
containers works well. If either pam_mount would support pgp based multi-key 
mode or losetup could be used with -p0 and multi-key input, this would be 
excellent.

rayServers is committed to supporting open source, we have already offered 
help to the Gentoo project. Jari, I have seen in the archives that you refuse 
any contributions, but one of the projects that I would like to see become 
mainstream is loop-aes. Let me know if I can help in any way.

Customers can purchase Installed Secure products with good privacy when 
shipped to a US based address - we accept many "digital currencies" that 
offer excellent privacy (unlike credit cards) such as pecunix.com 1mdc.com 
e-gold.com netpay.tv evocash.com etc. We only need a name and shipping 
address for such orders. UML hosting can be practically anonymous except for 
an email address. We prefer not to handle your personal information and you 
can contact us securely using PGP/GnuPG as well as several web based secure 
email options linked in the footer of our site. See our site for more details 
including an Export FAQ.

I haven't refused contributions to loop-AES that make sense. In fact, many
of the ideas and code to improve security has come from other persons.

However, long time ago I repeatedly tried to submit bug fixes to mainline,
most of which were dropped. Eventually, I stopped wasting my time submitting
fixes to mainline.

Hi!

An error in lilo.conf caused the kernel panic I wrote about earlier, 
thanks for the help.

Soon I also want to do what Jari described at 
http://www.spinics.net/lists/crypto/msg01063.html. Could you, Jari, make 
this patch available at sourceforge with your signature, possibly with a 
small README (you could copy most things from the URL mentioned above), 
also telling how to apply the patch?

Recently I asked about howtos or best practices for allowing root 
encryption and plausibe deniability for protecting e.g. against
"lead-pipe" attackers or a provisional court order (which later could be
sentenced as unlawful). Unfortunately there were no comment on that yet 
(Jari also didn't comment this).

Alan commented my second related question:

Isn't is possible to disguise real root as an unformatted or "Gutmann"

random crap)?

That patch should work if loopinfo.lo_name is changed to
loopinfo.lo_file_name in xstrncpy() function call.

However, it will not work ok with gpg encrypted key file as required by
loop-AES' multi-key mode. One would have to use two different key files, one
of those key files hidden someplace where lead pipe guys don't look.

If it says /dev/hda5 then swap is not encrypted.

Check that /sbin/swapon and /sbin/swapoff (really a symlink) are from
patched version of util-linux. Also check that the option fields of
/etc/fstab lines do not have any spaces or tabs.

&gt; In /etc/fstab (loop=/dev/loop?), I can replace ? with any number from 0

Yes.

Please post full encrypted swap line from your /etc/fstab, with nothing
removed or added.

Hi!

I don´t know what problems you have with "Jari´s great README" but to your
question

&gt; Going even further - which ways do exist to set up dual-cipher encryption?

I can assure you that Loop-AES is capable to use several ciphers for the
same partition. I successfully compiled loop-aes *plus* the cipher package.
You are free to use several modules and several "layers" of loop-aes. This
way you can encrypt the partition once in aes256, once again in twofish 256
and once more in serpent 128 if you deem this is necessary.
Unfortunately there is no patch out yet to use this kind of thing for root /
swap encryption. Nevertheless, it´s up to you.
And don´t forget, there is no other source out there to do this kind of
thing with your data. 
Ever tried to encrypt your WinXP box and boot it from USB-Stick?

Regards,
Peter

Hi again,

at item 12 and 13c in the loop-AES readme (boot from CD), from which
directory do I run the script and lilo?

I'm currently using grub, and I would like to keep at least one old 
kernel if I'm not successful with booting the new one and encrypting /.

&gt;&gt;And is it possible to suspend to disk with root encryption?
&gt; I don't recommend suspend when there are encryption keys in kernel RAM.

Wouldn't the keys be encrypted when written to disk with suspend? Is it 
possible in theory to use suspend to disk without an unencrypted partition?

&gt; Human memorizable passphrase that protects the key file is the weakest part.
&gt; If attacker does not have that file, then it eliminates that weakness.

I see. How long should the passphrase ideally be?

Thanks,

Christian

P.S. Can someone from the US call this Adobe number 888-724-4508 and ask 
to delete the mailing list's e-mail from their record? They don't seem 
to offer a different way to cancel.

Hi Christian,

&gt; I see. How long should the passphrase ideally be?

See diceware.com about choosing really strong passwords. Long phrases or 
sentences do not really cut it. A ten word diceware phrase puts you in the 
128+ bits of entropy range, throw in some extra special characters for good 
measure and you will be in the 30 char password length range.

Some time ago I saw someone do suspend to encrypted partition, but problem
with that was the restore part that had to set up encrypted loop device to
restore from, which included mounting a file system. Kernel gurus said that
the mount thingy before restore-from-suspend caused some sort of
inconsistency between on-disk data and kernel page cache, or something like
that. IOW, don't do that.

&gt; is the recommended way of re-encrypting using multi-key mode? Does it
&gt; require booting with a rescue disk (Knoppix, for example) and using
&gt; aespipe? Any pitfalls to look for?

1) Make sure that loop code (loop.o/loop.ko or kernel patch) is from any
   loop-AES-v2.X version. Module must be copied to /boot/modules-XXXX/
   directory, where XXXX is kernel version.

2) Make sure that mount+losetup+swapon programs are from loop-AES-v2.X
   util-linux patched version, including /bin/mount /bin/umount
   /sbin/losetup /sbin/swapon and most importantly /boot/losetup

3) Create /boot/rootkey.gpg by running step 9 of README example 7.5.

4) Create new initrd.gz by running steps 10 to 13 of README example 7.5.
   USEGPGKEY=1 must be set in build-initrd.sh config.

5) Boot from rescue CD-ROM

6) Mount /boot partition as /mnt, step 18 of README example 7.5.

7) Run root partition data through two copies of aespipe. First one
   decrypts your single-key encrypted data, and second one encrypts in
   multi-key mode. aespipe version must be aespipe-v2.2a or newer.

    dd if=/dev/hda2 bs=64k \
       | /mnt/aespipe -d -e AES128 -T -S `cat /mnt/seed.txt` -C 100 \
       | /mnt/aespipe -e AES128 -K /mnt/rootkey.gpg -G / -w 120 \
       | dd of=/dev/hda2 bs=64k conv=notrunc

   Above assumes that /dev/hda1 is /boot partition and /dev/hda2 is root
   partition. First aespipe command line parameters must be same that you
   used to encrypt, but with -d option added. Note that there is 120 second
   delay before second aespipe asks for a password (it is that "-w 120"
   option).

8) Clean up by running step 20 of README example 7.5.

Above README file example 7.5. refers to loop-AES-v2.1b version.

By the way you changed the subject, are you saying I have to re-encrypt
the file system? It was already encrypted with a 2.4.22 kernel.

Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen's watermark attack broke single-key mode.

If a file system was encrypted in single-key mode, then it should be
re-encrypted in multi-key mode to have better resistance against watermark
attack.

So does this Multikey mode require more resources?  I am running on only
a 700 mhz laptop, and wonder if multikey would slow it down any.

I haven't looked at SuSE 9.1 patches, but that patch will most likely work
ok. Latest version is in latest loop-AES package:
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/

If losetup man page says it supports -K option, and that -K option
description mentions multi-key mode, then your util-linux is most likely
already patched with loop-AES' multi-key support, and you can use
it without patching.

&gt; Also, after the make command I cannot find any loop.o or loop.ko file.

That is strange. Please post output of "ls -l" of loop-AES build directory.

&gt; My kernel version is 2.6.5-7.95. Does it matter in which directory I

Like this:

    cd /usr/src
    tar xvjf loop-AES-v2.1b.tar.bz2
    cd loop-AES-v2.1b
    make
    make tests

&gt; And how do I verify for sure which kernel has been loaded? (I'm asking
&gt; this beause even after choosing my new compiled kernel at the grub boot
&gt; menu, the last line before login says that the default kernel was loaded
&gt; - if this is a bug, how do I fix it?)

Run command:

    uname -a

&gt; P.S. Does a patched gnupg make sense even if my passphrase is composed

Yes, patched gpg is better.

No, it didn't mention multi-key mode. But after following "4. 
Instructions for building new mount, umount, losetup, swapon and 
swapoff" it does.

However, I'm worried about your saying "Do *not* install all the 
utilities in the util-linux package without thinking. You may ruin your 
system if you do that. Read the INSTALL file provided with util-linux 
tarball.". Am I safe if I only performed the comments below your saying 
"These commands, as root user, will recompile and install mount, umount,
losetup, swapon, swapoff and their man pages:"? I'm still a Linux 
newbie, just wanting to easily setup root encryption to get rid of 
Windows + Compusec (free closed source root encryption for Windows) :-)

BTW, does someone understand why no flavor of UNIX I'm aware of and no 
Linux distribution offers integrated root encryption?

&gt;&gt;Also, after the make command I cannot find any loop.o or loop.ko file.
&gt; That is strange. Please post output of "ls -l" of loop-AES build directory.

In your howto, sometimes you don't mention where to execute a command. 
It may be obvious for people with more Linux experience, but it wasn't 
for me. loop.ko does exist now.

&gt;&gt;And how do I verify for sure which kernel has been loaded? (I'm asking
&gt;&gt;this beause even after choosing my new compiled kernel at the grub boot
&gt;&gt;menu, the last line before login says that the default kernel was loaded
&gt;&gt;- if this is a bug, how do I fix it?)
&gt; Run command:
&gt;     uname -a

It's strange: My only self-compiled kernel is named 
vmlinuz-2.6.5-7.95-default-neo1 (compiled on 00:58 CET Jul 27 2004) and 
I can boot it, but uname -a keeps saying that I'm runnung 
vmlinuz-2.6.5-7.95-default 00:58 CET Jul 27 2004.

If I try to load loop.ko from /lib/modules/2.6.5-7.95-default/block, it 
fails. After renaming loop.ko to loop.tmp and copying loop.ko from 
/lib/modules/2.6.5-7.95-default-neo1/block, loading and "make tests" 
works!!!

&gt;&gt;P.S. Does a patched gnupg make sense even if my passphrase is composed
&gt;&gt;of over 20 quite alleatory characters?
&gt; Yes, patched gpg is better.

If someone uses a non-patched gpg, would this represent one of the 
weakest known elements for an attacks? Which ones would be the other ones?

Some days ago you wrote:
 &gt; loop-AES is also vulnerable to attacker modifying ciphertext

So if someone modifies data on the crypted harddrive while I'm e.g. 
sleeping (but without modifying my boot USB stick or CD-R), he could 
decipher my data if he steals the laptop later?

Many thanks,

Christian

losetup command line syntax that you used is correct for cryptoloop

I wondered what the difference is between the crypto loop that is
already in the 2.6 kernel, and the loop-AES patch.  So one question
then.. I followed the readme on 
http://linuxfromscratch.org/~devine/erfs-howto.html and what I don't
know is if I will need to modify the initrd.gz, and also the patched
binary files (such as losetup ).  If I change those incorrectly I am
certain the machine won't be able to boot the old kernel anymore either.

you do have an emergency boot cd, don't you? 

if you change from 2.4 to 2.6 kernel you need to modify the files.
have a look at loop-AES readme.

&gt; I have a machine with an encrypted root filesystem on kernel 2.4.22 with

&gt; 2.6.6 ). Since loop-AES-v2.1b has a kernel patch for 2.6.6 I was
&gt; thinking I should use that kernel, so where I am unsure is will I have
&gt; to make changes to the initrd.gz and all the modified binaries, or will
&gt; just the patched kernel work (it doesn't seem to).

May I suggest that you:
1)  Rename old initrd.gz to initrd-old.gz
2)  Modify your bootloader configuration to load initrd-old.gz version
    with 2.4.22 kernel.
3)  Create new initrd.gz using build-initrd.sh from loop-AES-v2.1b
4)  Modify your bootloader configuration to load initrd.gz version
    with 2.6 kernels.

New initrd.gz should work ok with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, but having old
version there should enable you to boot old 2.4 kernel if something goes
wrong with new initrd.

Old losetup+mount will work with loop code from loop-AES-v1.X and
loop-AES-v2.X in single-key mode. Your root partition is using single-key
mode because it was created using loop-AES-v1.X . New losetup+mount from
loop-AES-v2.X versions will work with loop code from loop-AES-v1.X and
loop-AES-v2.X in single-key mode, and with loop code from loop-AES-v2.X in
both single-key and multi-key mode. IOW, it is safe to upgrade to newer
versions of losetup+mount.

There is one pitfall though: When module-init-tools are installed as needed
by 2.6 kernels, module-init-tools package renames /sbin/insmod to
/sbin/insmod.old and installs new /sbin/insmod that calls /sbin/insmod.old
when used with 2.4 kernels. If you are using module version of loop-AES,
then /boot directory should contain both insmod and insmod.old after
build-initrd.sh is run. On some distros, insmod.old may be called
insmod.modutils .

Quote from loop-AES-v2.1b/README lines 871 to 875:
"
If you are upgrading kernel of a system where root partition is already
encrypted, only steps 5 to 7 and 13 are needed. /boot/initrd.gz is kernel
independent and there is no need to re-create it for each kernel. However,
if you are upgrading from 2.4 kernel to 2.6 kernel, new insmod may need to
be copied to /boot directory by running step 12 before running step 13.
"

&gt; I wondered what the difference is between the crypto loop that is
&gt; already in the 2.6 kernel, and the loop-AES patch.

Mainline cryptoloop only does single-key mode, which has been broken. Since
your root partition is using single-key mode, your setup is also broken.
Re-encrypting using loop-AES multi-key mode is the way to go.

I am having trouble upgrading to a 2.6 kernel.
on a machine that has an encrypted root file system.
It acts as though I am typing in the pass phrase incorrectly.
I walked through the same walk through that I set it up with  from
http://linuxfromscratch.org/~devine/erfs-howto.html (aside from creating
the file systems of course because they were already there.)
What could I be missing?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I've been reading a lot of information regarding dm-crypt and

&gt; was wondering if the following dm-crypt setup method would solve the 
&gt; known-plaintext attack:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Encryption key generation and encryption using GPG:
&gt;
&gt; head -c 32 /dev/urandom &gt; secure.key
&gt; gpg -c --cipher-algo AES256 secure.key
&gt;
&gt; 2. Secure volume creation using dm-crypt:
&gt;
&gt; /usr/bin/gpg -q --cipher-algo AES256 --decrypt secure.key.gpg | \
&gt; 	/usr/local/bin/cryptsetup create secure_dev /dev/hdaX


This sort of password set-up is exactly what I proposed in my disk 
encryption write-up for Gentoo users ( 
http://www.sdc.org/~leila/usb-dongle/ ).

I think that a random password is a good idea in any event, and 
probably protects from one of the attacks mentioned recently.

I do NOT yet have a firm grasp of the issue, but:

But probably would NOT protect against watermark (which is 
chosen-plaintext attack). Problem there is the treatment of the 
per-sector password for the block encryption: loop-AES runs through a 
number of iterations, dm-crypt and cryptoloop do not.

I started to become concerned with the cryptoloop implementation 
earlier this week when I was looking at how OpenBSD and FreeBSD do disk 
encryption -- they take some pains to obfuscate the "sector-ID-ness" of 
the block encryption. (GBDE of FreeBSD seems that it would be 
particularly strong against watermark attack.)

Bottom line is that dm-crypt is better with the pure-random password 
that you propose, but probably still not the best implementation 
available. But I am clueless, really. I do hope that we get more 
comments on this!

Why do you stick with dm-crypt?

After reading about the weaknesses of dm-crypt and cryptoloop I
switched to loop-AES, and wrote an article about the issue so that I
wouldn't have to tell friends the same story over and over again.

Watermark attack exploits weakness in IV computation and the fact that same
key is used for all sectors.

loop-AES' multi-key mode resistance against watermark attack is result of
stronger IV computation. Using different keys for different sectors also
helps a little bit.

Scientifically? Unfortunately not. Loop-AES is only secure if it has

cryptoloop/dm-crypt are vulnerable to watermark/optimized dictionary

Watermark attack:

&gt; Also, I have questions related to file backed loop-aes encryption.

I would avoid file backed loop-aes completely. Too much uncertainty
lies in what could be the cause of lockups.


&gt; The reason I dont want to use device backed loop-aes is the dependency from
&gt; the block device. If I use file backed loop-aes and one server crashes, I
&gt; can just copy the crypto container as file to to an arbitrary fs created on
&gt; a i.e. a ide, scsi-blockdevice or even software raid of a new server. I
&gt; think I wouldnt have this functionality if I backup the (ide-,scsi- or
&gt; software raid-) block device with "dd" (maybe I am wrong?).

In theory this should work. A partition image can be mounted, so it
should work with loop-AES as well. This should be sufficient to
access your data in case of an emergency, but be sure to mount the
image read-only. Because of the filesystem's last access time (atime)
record a simple 'ls -al' causes a write. Of course you could use
noatime as mount option but I would play it safe.

I would go along with this.


OTOH, don't know about your setup... a different approach could be to
split up your large data collection in smaller chunks (directorywise,
f.e.) tar/bzip2 'em up and use gpg to encrypt the *.tar.bz2.

Additionally you could use rar to create archives with recovery
information, this comes in handy if network traffic somehow caused
corrupted files. The big disadvantage with gpg is that even slightly
corrupted encrypted files can't be decrypted. Therefore I use the
'protective layer' of rar archives. :)

Then you could use rsync (over ssh) for backup. This method is quite
messy (setup, maintenance, ressources), but works.

Sure, if VPN suits his needs. Might be a bit oversized for plain
backup imho. However, this could also be of interest:

http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/

"rssh is a restricted shell for use with OpenSSH, allowing only scp
and/or sftp. For example, if you have a server which you only want to
allow users to copy files off of via scp, without providing shell
access, you can use rssh to do that."

Thanks for the fast replies :)

&gt; Scientifically? Unfortunately not. Loop-AES is only secure if it has
&gt; been set up in multi-key mode with encrypted swap.

Yes, I already read this from the docs. If all these options are activated,
there is no attack possible (at least not yet known)?

I need the highest possible security, because the backup servers are not
trustworthy.

I also read some pages about a (very theoretical) attack of AES. Does
somebody have benchmarks for AES128, AES256 and other ciphers like twofish
etc? Are the performance differences between these ciphers even noticeable
on a P4 3 GHz running database services and Samba?

I thought about such a solution, too, but it simply doesnt work in my case.
See, my servers hold hunderts of gigabyte of data. If just 1 bit is changed,
gpg would create a different encryption stream from this on =&gt; the gpg file
is not rsyncable, so that each day my entire data would have to be
transferred. Creating a gpg archive for each directory or even for each file
would still be too inefficient, because I have very large database files
with a size of multiple gbs. They are really good rsyncable when not
encrypted. The aim would be to add real strong encryption and to keep the
efficiency of rsync.

Another question: how does loop-aes react on bad blocks?

AFAIK loop-aes is fully transparent on block level I/O.
It is not a stream cipher. Each disk block is encrypted
independently on others. Am I wrong?

I don't have a link for benchmarks but would be interested in one
though. By rule of thumb, you won't notice loop-AES on such a large
machine if the server load is low/medium. AES is implemented in
optimized assembler code.

AES was picked because of its strength and speed. Serpent made 2nd
place (it's considered slightly stronger than AES but slower - IIRC).


&gt; Another question: how does loop-aes react on bad blocks? 

Like bad physical sectors on hard disks? Nothing any soft can do
about it. The data stored in those areas most likely can't be
read/restored completely. That's bad enough, but with file system
encryption each damaged sector is a total loss (IF I understand the
working concept of loop-AES right). Jari will know for sure :)

I consider myself lucky... haven't had to endure such a mess.

A while ago I asked about worst case scenarios but aside from a hint
to search the archives (doing so turned up negative), there was no
reply. I take that as a good sign :-)

loop-AES is still vulnerable to attacks that involve trojaning utilities
used to mount and use encrypted file systems (losetup, mount, gpg,
kernel+modules, init scripts, and other suid root programs).

loop-AES is also vulnerable to attacker modifying ciphertext; ciphertext is
not authenticated and attacker tampered ciphertext will decrypt without
detection. It is possible for attacker to revert whole file system
ciphertext to some earlier version (if attacker had access and saved old
ciphertext). Also each individual 512 byte sector can be reverted to old
state. It is possible to copy ciphertext of known plaintext to other sector,
and only first 16 bytes of copied ciphertext will decrypt incorrectly.

My point is: secure software crypto in rooted or otherwise insecure box is
impossible to achieve.

&gt; Another question: how does loop-aes react on bad blocks?

I/O errors of underlying device are reported to file system on top of loop
device. It is up to file system to report I/O errors to applications.

Errors resulting from damaged ciphertext (no I/O error detected by
underlying device) stay in same 512 byte block where damaged ciphertext is
and errors will not propagate to other sectors.

For security of AES and Serpent have a look at:

If speed isnt really a problem with modern hardware, it would be nice to
know the opinion of crypto analysts which one the safest cipher is according
to current knowledge.

Hi Jari!

&gt; Some older loop-AES README files said that ext3 -&gt; loop -&gt; file-on-ext3
&gt; (data=ordered or data=journal) should work. Newer versions of README
&gt; advise
&gt; to not use file backed loops at all. File backed loops may work under
&gt; certain circumstances, but it is better to avoid using them.
I just had another idea which would fit my needs:

ext3 -&gt; loop-aes -&gt; software raid1 -&gt; hda1,hdb1 + loop (without encryption)
-&gt; file on ext3

Each time I want to backup my data, I do a raidhotadd of the loop device. I
wait until it is rebuild using the data from the partions hda1, hdb1. If the
rebuild is finished, I create a consistent state of the file system by
terminating samba and data base engines. I do a raidhotremove of the loop
device and have a perfect snapshot.

In case of restore, I would use the loop device to rebuild the partitions.

Would this scenario work?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not worried about the file transfer to the backup machines. I dont
&gt; &gt; fully (actually not at all) trust the backup machines. I cant restrict
&gt; &gt; physical access to these machines and I am not the only one who has root
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; them. Theoretically, a secure whole disk encryption should deliver
&gt; enought
&gt; &gt; security even if the image is world readable, right?
&gt; 
&gt; loop-AES is still vulnerable to attacks that involve trojaning utilities
&gt; used to mount and use encrypted file systems (losetup, mount, gpg,
&gt; kernel+modules, init scripts, and other suid root programs).

Right, I just forgot to point out, that the images are of course not mounted
on the backup servers. 

&gt; loop-AES is also vulnerable to attacker modifying ciphertext; ciphertext
&gt; is
&gt; not authenticated and attacker tampered ciphertext will decrypt without
&gt; detection. It is possible for attacker to revert whole file system
&gt; ciphertext to some earlier version (if attacker had access and saved old
&gt; ciphertext). Also each individual 512 byte sector can be reverted to old
&gt; state. It is possible to copy ciphertext of known plaintext to other
&gt; sector,
&gt; and only first 16 bytes of copied ciphertext will decrypt incorrectly.

Nice, I havent thought of this possibility. Maybe one could store a md5
checksum of the crypto container inside the crypto container itself and
check consistency when the fs is mounted. However, this would mean to read
the entire crypto container at each mount. Adding checksums to each block
(checksum also includes position of block) would be another way.

I need to correct myself: if the last method is used, its not possible to
move blocks inside the crypto container, however an elder version of this
block could be used to overwrite the new one without notice.

A combination of the two methods might be of some use though.  You can
checksum each block, and then checksum the checksums (will speed up
checksum verification of the whole filesystem by some [large] factor).
You may not notice a modified block at mount if an attacker preserves
its checksum, but if you verify each block's checksum before reading and
maybe writing (caching, of course) you should not be tricked into using
a modified block.

to access the ciphertext, the attacker must have access to the

i too think that "100% secure" is never possible, because of a lot of

Yes, access to ciphertext usually needs root privileges. If attacker can get
root, it is game over right there.

Like I said before, loop-AES (and cryptoloop and dm-crypt) does not
authenticate ciphertext. It is ok to let attacker get copies of ciphertext
and software, but it not ok to let attacker modify ciphertext or software
prior to legitimate user using those ciphertext or software.

I, as a user, would just like to know if my data is safe or vulnerable if I
did what was told me in the loop-aes readme.
Brute Force attacks can allways be started and the "attacker" will of course
be able to disassemble my PC and get the hard drive. The point is just that
AES with 128 or more bit is kinda strong encryption and loop-aes using GPG
prevents this data from brute force attacks.
So for me the present state remains that loop-aes plus GPG and multi-key
mode are the safest way to encrypt a partition. I don´t know any other
product like pgpdisk or else that ever reached this kind of security.
Nevertheless, I´d sereously like to know which thread you are concering
about. Is there anything worng with loop-aes or aes as such? I´m sorry for
not getting the point...


regards,
Peter

On subject line you said that you were using loop-AES-v2.1a, but
loop-AES-v2.1b was released on May 27 2004, and it included a fix for this
bug: "Fixed bio vec merge bug that only affected loop on top of md-raid0 or
md-linear (2.6 kernels only)."

I am using loopAES on a software-raid5 with 5 disks
for more than half a year now. I never had any
problems. I have kernel 2.4.25.

No. That is mixture of lilo config and grub config, and will work with
neither lilo nor grub.

&gt; Question 2: In Step 12 it says:
&gt; 
&gt; 12) Build new /boot/initrd.gz
&gt; 
&gt;         ./build-initrd.sh /boot/initrd.conf
&gt; 
&gt; but I noticed that not all of the configuration options that I initially
&gt; changed in build-initrd.sh are in the initrd.conf file in Step 10a.  Do I
&gt; add these to that file or will it use what I have set in the buid-initrd.sh
&gt; file as defaults and only change the options that I have specifically set in
&gt; initrd.conf?

Values set in build-initrd.sh are defaults. Additional configuration file
/boot/initrd.conf can override any defaults it wants.

Here I suggest that you put all your local changes to /boot/initrd.conf and
use unmodified build-initrd.sh from loop-AES tarball.

&gt; Question 3:  In Step 20 it says:
&gt; 
&gt; 20) Clean up and reboot your computer. The 'dd' command attempts to
&gt;     overwrite gpg encrypted root partition key file and 'mkswap' command
&gt;     restores "temporary file system on swap" /dev/hda3 back to swap usage.
&gt; 
&gt;         dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/rootkey.gpg bs=64k count=1 conv=notrunc
&gt;         umount /mnt
&gt;         sync
&gt;         mkswap /dev/hda3
&gt;         sync
&gt;         reboot
&gt; 
&gt; Am I rebooting the computer with my rescue disk again?
&gt; 
&gt; If so, after doing so, do I need to first mount /dev/hda3 again?  The dd
&gt; command above seems to be trying to overwrite a file on a filesystem that
&gt; isn't mounted.  But maybe I am missing something here?
&gt; 
&gt; If not, what am I rebooting the computer with?  The boot CD that I just
&gt; made?

You don't need to do any of above. If your root partition is already
encrypted and you want to create CD-ROM that boots to your existing
encrypted root partition, then only these steps are needed:

- step 7
- copy rootkey.gpg to /boot/iso/rootkey.gpg
- steps 10a to 13e

(Above step numbers refer to loop-AES-v2.1b README Example 6, and may be
different on newer or older loop-AES versions)

&gt; Question 4:  Do I need the /dev/hda1 or /boot parition after I finish?  If
&gt; so, I didn't seem to encrypt it yet so can I encrypt it in the same way that
&gt; I did for /dev/hda2, the root partition?

Separate /boot partition is not needed on CD-ROM boot, but some tools still
want to find files from /boot directory.

Following "umount /boot" might not succeed because there may already be
processes with open files in /boot partition. To find out which processes
you need to kill before /boot can be unmounted, use this command:

    lsof | grep /boot

You can copy those files to root partition, like this:

    umount /boot
    mkdir /boot-old
    mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /boot-old
    cp -dpR /boot-old/* /boot
    umount /boot-old
    rmdir /boot-old

And then remove /dev/hda1 mount line from /etc/fstab file.
After that /dev/hda1 is free unused partition.

John Poirier wrote:
&gt; I made encrypted a pair of disks using loop-AES on Debian Woody. I

&gt; 
&gt;   losetup -e aes -k 128 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /dev/hde &gt; /keyfile
&gt; 
&gt;   In other words, create a loopback device based on this hard disk and 
&gt; unencrypt it using the AES cipher and the contents of "keyfile" which 
&gt; is a 128 bit key.
&gt; 
&gt; So what I did after I installed Gentoo was download the freshest 
&gt; util-linux and aes-loop. I patched util-linux and compiled with no 
&gt; problem and I was able to make and install loop.ko with no problem as 
&gt; well. I compiled my kernel without loopback support as called for by 
&gt; install docs, and loaded loop.ko using
&gt; 
&gt;   modprobe loop
&gt; 
&gt;   modprobe -l verifies that it is loaded.
&gt; 
&gt; So far so good. The problem is that this version of losetup no longer 
&gt; takes the -k option and I can't remember what version I was using 
&gt; before. I also can't remember if I used patched util-linux or something 
&gt; else. Okay, so i changed "aes" to "aes-128". Now I enter the command:
&gt; 
&gt;   losetup -e aes-128 -p 0 /dev/loop0 /dev/hde &gt; /keyfile
&gt; 
&gt;   I get no errors, but when I try to mount loop0 I get told that it 
&gt; can't find a filesystem on the device. Is this a problem with the 
&gt; "offset"? Why have the parameters of this program changed? I'm not sure 
&gt; what's going on here. In fact, I don't even really know if it is the 
&gt; kernel, the binary or my configuration that is screwing things up for 
&gt; me and don't know how to tell.

losetup -e aes128 -p 0 -H rmd160 /dev/loop0 /dev/hde &lt; /keyfile
                       ^^^^^^^^^                     ^

Above syntax uses single-key mode, which has been broken, and as such
is not recommended.

&gt; What I am actually trying to head towards here eventually is accessing 
&gt; these drives using dm-crypt. Are these even compatible?

dm-crypt is cryptoloop compatible. Current versions of dm-crypt and
cryptoloop are both broken and backdoored, and as such useless for securifty
needs.

Dear Sir,
Sequel to the secretive arrangement in regards of the
shipment of your contract sum, I wish to inform you
that all necessary modalities have been automatically
concluded and has left Nigeria to London via your
Country today by Express Cargo Flight.
Note carefully that the content of the crate is
"MONEY" but I did not disclose it to the Courier
Services as Money, rather I informed them that the
crate contain Vital "DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS" belonging
to my client (that?s you).
However, On no account should you disclose the content
of the crate with the Diplomatic Courier Services for
fear of betrayal. So do not allow them to know that
the content is money.
Further more, kindly get back to me as soon as possible
so that i can furnish with you every modalities
regards to the conclusion of this transaction.
Meanwhile, I will be coming over to your country
immediately the consignment arrives in your Country
for my 20% share.
Congrats and remain blessed.

I have already implemented that. I'm waiting for Marcelo to release 2.4.27
kernel, and I then will release loop-AES-v2.1c that includes AMD64 optimized
assembler implementations of AES and MD5. It is all tested and ready for
release.

AMD Opteron 1593.7 MHz, gcc-3.2.2

AES C implementation:
key length 128 bits, encrypt speed 690.0 Mbits/s

key length 256 bits, encrypt speed 507.7 Mbits/s
key length 256 bits, decrypt speed 527.0 Mbits/s

AES assembler implementation:
key length 128 bits, encrypt speed 1106.6 Mbits/s
key length 128 bits, decrypt speed 1107.0 Mbits/s
key length 192 bits, encrypt speed 932.3 Mbits/s

The BKL must be dropped voluntarily, e.g. via schedule() or
unlock_kernel(), to allow preemption when the BKL is held.

Oh, BTW, perhaps I should mention that this is in a Montavista version
of 2.4.20 -- I guess cryptoapi, and the IPSEC stuff that uses it, is
generally 2.6 material, but MV seems to have backported it.

Aside from some googling, I'd write to BSI and tell them about it. Or

Well, tomorrow I'm switching to FreeBSD and GBDE...

(I can try to do that with this server because it is dedicated for one 
purpose only: experimental disk server.)

There may be a way to port GBDE to Linux via an architecture like 
dm-crypt (which leverages a more-general treatment of block devices, as 
does BSD GEOM). But I think my first effort to port GBDE would be to 
Darwin/Mac OS.

Well, I can dream...

Hi All,

I am planning to implement an encryption hook using netfilter.

I have noticed that crypto_alloc_tfm() is allocating memory
without GFP_ATOMIC. From my understanding, this prevents
me from using it in bottom half mode, and thus directly
in my netfilter hook.

Are my assumptions correct? Is there a different way of allocating a
transform in
BH ?

 

 Kind Regards

   Idan

Can you check that the seed is same in all init scripts inside different

Yes, I copied the initrd.gz/sbin/init from the old file, and put it into the 
new one, so they would be identical.

&gt; losetup, swapon, swapoff and their man pages:"?

Yes.

&gt; &gt;&gt;And how do I verify for sure which kernel has been loaded? (I'm asking
&gt; &gt;&gt;this beause even after choosing my new compiled kernel at the grub boot
&gt; &gt;&gt;menu, the last line before login says that the default kernel was loaded
&gt; &gt;&gt;- if this is a bug, how do I fix it?)
&gt; &gt; Run command:
&gt; &gt;     uname -a
&gt; 
&gt; It's strange: My only self-compiled kernel is named
&gt; vmlinuz-2.6.5-7.95-default-neo1 (compiled on 00:58 CET Jul 27 2004) and
&gt; I can boot it, but uname -a keeps saying that I'm runnung
&gt; vmlinuz-2.6.5-7.95-default 00:58 CET Jul 27 2004.

uname -a version comes from version strings that were set in top level
kernel Makefile, but on SUSE kernels you can change those strings by
changing CONFIG_RELEASE CONFIG_CFGNAME entries in kernel config.

Those entries need to be changed so that every kernel compiled has unique
version that does not conflict with any other kernel on same computer.

&gt; If I try to load loop.ko from /lib/modules/2.6.5-7.95-default/block, it
&gt; fails. After renaming loop.ko to loop.tmp and copying loop.ko from
&gt; /lib/modules/2.6.5-7.95-default-neo1/block, loading and "make tests"
&gt; works!!!

Looks like more than one kernel was compiled using same version string
2.6.5-7.95-default. Thus the confusion and incompatibility.

The fix is to recompile and boot new kernel using but using different
CONFIG_RELEASE CONFIG_CFGNAME strings.

&gt; Some days ago you wrote:
&gt;  &gt; loop-AES is also vulnerable to attacker modifying ciphertext
&gt; 
&gt; So if someone modifies data on the crypted harddrive while I'm e.g.
&gt; sleeping (but without modifying my boot USB stick or CD-R), he could
&gt; decipher my data if he steals the laptop later?

He can't decipher data after stealing your laptop, but ciphertext
modifications can cause somewhat predictable changes to plaintext data.

I was the guy that couldn't get cryptoloop and the CryptoAPI working
together on linux 2.4.26 a few weeks back.  I just wanted to mention
that I got it working. The problem was with the "make xconfig" script.
For some reason it disabled CryptoAPI whenever I used cryptoloop.
Strange.  I think that might have been because I was using Jari's
old cryptoloop kernel patch or something.  Dunno.  I had to enable
them both by using "make menuconfig" instead.  That worked.

Anyway,  so after I got that all working.  I just decided to give the
loop-AES package a try.  It works fine!  I now see the need for
multiple keys and keeping swap encrypted.  That's great stuff!  I'll
be using loop-aes from now on I think.

Thanks to all on this list who have helped me out.  I appreciate it!

Steve

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Adapted and merged Russell King's loop.c flush_dcache_page() fix. Most
  sane processors were not affected, but some processors with goofy aliasing
  caches were indeed affected (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
- Added optimized assembler implementations of AES and MD5 functions for
  AMD64 and compatible processors.
- Pentium-2 optimized assembler implementations of AES and MD5 are really
  i386 compatible, so now those assembler implementations are enabled for
  all x86 processors.
- Fixed Makefile to be compatible with distros that include "" characters in
  KERNELRELEASE string.
- Added dkms.conf configuration file for Dynamic Kernel Module Support.
  Charles Duffy wrote original version.
- Added support for /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source symlink.
- Converted MODULE_PARM macros to module_param (2.6 kernels only).
- Added workaround for scripts/modpost breakage (2.6 kernels only).

Additional ciphers package changes since previous release:
- Fixed Makefile to be compatible with distros that include "" characters in

- Added dkms.conf configuration file for Dynamic Kernel Module Support.
  Adapted from version that was originally written by Charles Duffy.

On my 300MHz Pentium-2 test box, multi-key mode delivers about 80% - 83%
performance of single-key mode when both use AES128.

The password is usually the last line of defense, at the point where the 
attacker has both the GPG keys and the encrypted randomly generated multi-key 
passphrase. At that point, the human who has the passphrase in his or her 
head is the weakest link since the attacker will have the person too, most 
likely, on some island... Analysing the threat scenarios usually eliminates 
the requirement of much more than AES128. It is usually far easier to get the 
password than to brute force a modern cipher, as far as I know.

If the attacker does not have access to the USB keychain with the PGP keys and 
the encrypted keyfile, then you get the full benefit of AES256 (whatever that 
means to you).

projects that contribute directly to our success and enhance the value of 
open source.

&gt; However, long time ago I repeatedly tried to submit bug fixes to mainline,
&gt; most of which were dropped. Eventually, I stopped wasting my time
&gt; submitting fixes to mainline.

I hope that mainline folks who might read this take it to heart that, in the 
opinion of this user, after a lot of practical testing, loop-aes provides a 
better and more stable crypto interface that that available in cryptoapi, and 
that I hope to see it merged into the mainline 2.6 kernels. 

At rayServers we certainly will only use loop-aes, given the resistance to the 
watermark attack, the simplicity of encrypted swap, and a stable losetup 
across a range of kernels.

Your setup should be ok now since you generated new 64 keys with encrypted

Imagine the following 2 scenarios:

a)
salted single key setup:
the encrypted image is stolen. the attacker knows the salt, but not the used
password.

b)
pgp multikey setup:
encrypted image + pgp encrypted multikey file is stolen and the attacker
doesnt know the pgp password.

In which case it is easier to recover the data? a) has some known security
weaknesses (watermark), but maybe its easier in b) to do brute force
cracking?

I think pgp must store some kind of checksum of the encrypted data, because
it recognizes if one enters a wrong password. I assume it could be exploited
to speed up cracking?

Your comments are appreciated.

Andreas

^^^^^^^

did you search the archives?
using loop-aes with aes for a few month now, just setup a 150GB twofish
volume too. no errors 'til now, only a fs-based Oops (xfs), which seems
to be fixed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, 9 Jun 2004 20:57:38 +0200, "newbie" &lt;tacron@gmx.net&gt; said:

[ ... ]

tacron&gt; Could you please answer the question?

&gt; Sorry, my guess is that the question is pointless/unanswerable. [...]

tacron&gt; The "could you please answer the question" referred to 17 keys
tacron&gt; ppdd vs. 64 keys loop-aes.

Yes, and I replied precisely on that point (wans't it throughly clear?).

I reckon that 17 vs. 64 question is pointless and unanswerable because
of all the reasons I have already given, mostly that without knowing
that kind of attacks etc. such small details are very difficult
evaluate.

&gt;&gt; Consider this argument, which is not necessarily good, but to me seems
&gt;&gt; to have some merit in some cases: having many keys, no matter whether 17
&gt;&gt; or 64, means that probably they cannot be easily memorized. If they
&gt;&gt; cannot, they have to be stored _somewhere_, encrypted with a key that
&gt;&gt; has to be memorized (all this said with a particular but obvious family
&gt;&gt; of cryptosystem architectures in mind).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does this improve or reduce ``security'' whatever that is? It's not so
&gt;&gt; obvious, and may depend quite a bit on the threat model, because it
&gt;&gt; seems to me that it trades off some data crypto hazards for some key
&gt;&gt; management hazards.

tacron&gt; I guess it improves. Even if you use 17 or 64 keys and not one
tacron&gt; for encrypting the sectors, you still have an incredibly large
tacron&gt; amount of data for statistical, differential or probabilistic
tacron&gt; attacks in the future.

Looks like a rather wild guess to me, because I think it is more or less
pointless to make any guess as to such details without making some
assumptions about the cryptosystem and the threat model, and the costs.

For example, switching from 1 to N&gt;&gt;1 keys means that key management
becomes a bigger task, and this may lead to reduced ``security'' under
some plausible threat scenarios (see below).

&gt;&gt; Maybe if you have a single not too complex key you can just hold it
&gt;&gt; in your head. Given that some plausible threat models are mostly
&gt;&gt; about key management mishaps, this might be more ``secure'' than
&gt;&gt; storing the vector of real encryption keys somewhere outside your
&gt;&gt; head, and keeping in your head just the passphrase with which you
&gt;&gt; encrypt that.

tacron&gt; Hmm, maybe you're getting something wrong here. Having more keys
tacron&gt; to encrypt the sectors seems to be better than just using one
tacron&gt; key or 17 or 64 keys.

Under which assumption? Under the assumption that you will never ever
have key management issues/threats? Encrypting the data is a small part
of a cryptosystem, and if one strengthens that at the expense of other
aspects perhaps there is an overall loss.

So, is it worth trading off the possibility of a linear (17, 64, ...)
factor of improved data ``security'' against the possibility of much
bigger problems with key ``security''? It all depends on cryptosystem
architecture, threat model and costs.

For example, suppose that part of the threat model is that the
adversary's goals are to gain access to the plaintext, or else *to deny
that access to you*.

The adversary has the added opportunity to impair/steal/destroy the
medium on which you have stored the many keys to achieve success, which
might be also much easier than trying to decrypt.

Is it worth to make it possibly harder for the adversary to gain access
to the plaintext if the price it to make it possibly easier for her to
deny that access to you? It all depends...

[ ... ]

  tacron&gt; becomes only a problem when encrypting every sector with a
  tacron&gt; single key.

&gt;&gt; This statement seems to me to be based on the assumption that what is
&gt;&gt; relevant is block size vs. *percentage* (100% vs. 5.9% or 1.5% or ...,
&gt;&gt; depending on the number of keys) instead of absolute quantity (and
&gt;&gt; likelyhood of known plaintext in it) of ciphertext potentially available
&gt;&gt; to an adversary. [ ... ]

tacron&gt; No. it relates to "although the 64-bit block size is now
tacron&gt; considered too short, because encrypting more than 232 data
tacron&gt; blocks can begin to leak information about the plaintext"
tacron&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29 However, I
tacron&gt; don't know when this 2^32 (around 4 billion) blocks is reached.

But this does say that the issue with block size is related not to
percentage of ciphertext encrypted with one key, but to the _absolute_
amount of ciphertext encrypted with one key. With a 64 bit block size
there is a high probability of exploitable (``birthday'' attack) repeats
after 2^(64/2) 8 byte blocks (a bit over 30GB) have been encrypted:

  http://LASECWWW.EPFL.CH/birthday.shtml

What matters is not how many keys have been used (that is, the
percentage of data encrypted with one key), but whether each key has
been used to encrypt more than 2^(64/2) blocks.

Having multiple keys for much larger partitions reduces the _absolute_
quantity of data encrypted with one key for a given _absolute_ size of
the partition, but that's an indirect effect.

If the total amount of data is less than 30GB then "encrypting every
sector with a single key" is not that big a problem wrt to ``birthday''
attacks; conversely, even with multiple keys, if each key is used to
encrypt more than 32GB there might be problems.

Note also that the leakage might be described as pretty small (a few
bytes out of 30GB), and might not matter that much compared to other
problems caused by the very large amount of data available, and to the
high likelyhood that in a filesystem there is known plaintext at known
sector offsets.

Also, in disk encryptors there may be a different IV per sector (its not
quite CBC mode), which perhaps makes things different, and the plaintext
may not have easily guessable statistical properties (much of it may be
compressed or other binaries), so I don't really know if the possibility
of ``birthday attacks'' is that relevant. As usual, it all depends on
the context...

Sure,, every little helps an adversary, but again what matters is to get
a ``sufficient'' level of ``security'', given expected cryptosystem,
threats and costs.

As a personal opinion, the 64-bit block issue with Blowfish is so
pointless, because there are significant reasons to go with AES
regardless, similar to those described here:

&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Wokó³ czego

nadzorczej Banku Millennium. Marek Belka pe³ni±c misjê w Iraku przesta³ byæ 
cz³onkiem w³adz banku, a jednak to w³a¶nie Bank Millennium okaza³ siê tym 
polskim bankiem, który mia³ najszerzej operowaæ na rynku irackim. Belka 
twierdzi, i¿ zapomnia³ o swoim by³ym chlebodawcy, a wy³±cznym kryterium

poszed³ jak w dym za swoim by³ym&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt; cz³onkiem 
rady nadzorczej... &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Jedyny namacalny 
efekt gospodarczej obecno¶ci Polski w Iraku to afera z przetargiem na samochód

&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Jak Belka

nie jest kwestia wiary w obietnice, nieznany jest sam przedmiot wiary.

&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;A jednak s± tacy, 
których Belka przekona³. EUREKO i Bank Millennium to najwiêksi zwolennicy 
tymczasowego gabinetu. &lt;BR&gt;Bank Millennium - co to jest? Bank Millennium to 
kolejna nazwa Banku Inicjatyw Gospodarczych BIG S.A. powsta³ego w 1989 roku. 
Za³o¿ycielami banku by³y osoby prywatne i instytucje pañstwowe: Polska Poczta 
Telegraf i Telefon, Polska ¯egluga &lt;/FONT&gt;M&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;orska, 
Pañstwowy Zak³ad Ubezpieczeñ PZU. Dlaczego owe pañstwowe przedsiêbiorstwa 
zainwestowa³y w bank do spó³ki z osobami fizycznymi tego nie wiadomo. Wiadomo 
natomiast na czym BIG w chwili powstania zarabia³. Ju¿ wówczas zarabia³ na PZU. 
PZU by³o najwiêk&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;zym depozytariuszem 
BIG-u. BIG pozyskane ¶rodki lokowa³ na wy¿szy procent w innych bankach. Dlaczego 
PZU nie lokowa³ bezpo¶rednio funduszy na wy¿szy procent lecz deponowa³ pieni±dze 
w BIG-u tego nie wiadomo do dzisiaj. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New \
Roman"&gt;Bank Millennium  wraz z EUREKO nabyli 30% akcji PZU za 3 mld 
z³otych, co wed³ug niezale¿nych wycen stanowi³o poni¿ej 10% warto¶ci PZU. 
Ponadto Bank Millennium i EUREKO uzurpuj± sobie prawo do kontroli nad 
ubezpieczycielem. Zast±pienie Kodeksu handlowego Kodeksem spó³ek handlowych 
bezdyskusyj&lt;/FONT&gt;n&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;ie przywróci³o kontrolê Skarbu 
Pañstwa nad PZU. Wiêkszo¶ciowi akcjonariusze maj± bezwzglêdne prawo do odwo³ania 
zarz±du spó³ki akcyjnej. Skarb Pañstwa posiada ponad 50% akcji PZU - tego EUREKO

&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -1px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Ciekawa to

przej±æ swojego za³o¿yciela, który jest w Polsce monopolist± w zakresie

&lt;P style="MARGIN-TOP: -5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" 
align=justify&gt;Bank Millennium wspó³pracuj±c z Belk± mia³ przej±æ lwi± czê¶æ 
operacji wykonywanych przez polskie banki w Iraku. Jednak okaza³o siê, ¿e nie ta 
wiedza i nie t umiejêtno¶ci. Teraz - ju¿ jako premier - Belka ma rozwi±zaæ 
konflikt pomiêdzy EUREKO i Skarbem Pañstwa. Dla niewielkiego EUREKO przejêcie 
PZU to tra&lt;/FONT&gt;n&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;sakcja ¿ycia. Nie dziwne wiêc, ¿e

face="Times New Roman"&gt;Lobbing EUREKO nie znalaz³ jednak wsparcia w instytucjach

to jego prywatna sprawa. Je¿eli potrafi dowie¶æ swoich racji to ma tak± 
mo¿liwo¶æ w postêpowaniu s±dowo-arbitra¿owym. Wszelki zabiegi o sankcje i 
reperkusje wobec Polski nie znalaz³y odzewu. EUREKO jedyne co osi±gn±³ to

nietrafione. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;EUREKO i Bank 
Millennium doskonale zdaj± sobie sprawê, ¿e transakcja zakupu akcji PZU za

&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Kilkana¶cie dni 
wcze¶niej - jeszcze jako nie kandydat na ministra skarbu - Socha wypowiada³ siê

stanowisko EUREKO i Banku Millennium, czyli jak najszybsze dokoñczenie 
prywatyzacji i przeprowadzenie oferty publicznej. W³a¶nie o taki scenariusz 
zabiega EUREKO i Bank Millennium, które oczekuj± specjalnej oferty skierowanej 
dla mniejszo¶ciowych (ale "strategicznych") akcjona&lt;/FONT&gt;r&lt;FONT 
face="Times New Roman"&gt;iuszy. Socha nie znaj±cy wzajemnych zobowi±zañ obu stron, 
ani nie posiadaj±cy wiedzy o stanie sporu wypowiada siê na korzy¶æ przeciwnika 
procesowego Skarbu Pañstwa. Jest to co najmniej nietypowe zachowanie jak 
na funkcjonariusza publicznego. Z ca³± pewno¶&lt;/FONT&gt;c&lt;FONT 
face="Times New Roman"&gt;i± prezentowanie przez Jacka Sochê takich opinii 
dyskwalifikuje go jako kandydata na ministra skarbu - osobê która ma zajmowaæ 
siê ...sporem EUREKO i Banku Millennium ze Skarbem Pañstwa. Czy minister skarbu 
pañstwa w sporze ze Skarbem Pañstwa ma reprezent&lt;/FONT&gt;o&lt;FONT 
face="Times New Roman"&gt;waæ interesy EUREKO i Banku Millennium? To by³oby 
nie do pomy¶lenia nawet w bananowych republikach.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Kandydat na 
premiera oferuje tekê ministra skarbu osobie zaanga¿owanej w spór prywatnej 
firmy ze Skarbem Pañstwa, tyle ¿e osobie zaanga¿owanej nie po stronie Skarbu 
Pañstwa. Je¿eli premier równie¿ jest zwi±zany z t± sam± spó³k± to mo¿e i nic 
dziwnego... &lt;BR&gt;Belka mo¿e powiedzieæ, i¿ nie s³ysza³ o takich wypowiedziach, 
a  z Soch± o Banku Millennium i PZU ...nie mia³ okazji rozmawiaæ. 
Traktuj±c rzecz z w³a¶ciw± powag± trzeba powiedzieæ, ¿e dzia³ania premiera \
jednoznacznie wskazuj± na mo¿liwo¶æ  urzeczywistnienia siê afery gospodarczej o skali \
jakiej dotychczas w Polsce nie  by³o. Dzia³ania Belki, pocz±wszy od jego misji w \
Iraku a skoñczywszy na  formowaniu rz±du powi&lt;/FONT&gt;n&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;ny \
staæ siê obiektem  wnikliwej analizy polskich s³u¿b specjalnych. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: -5px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align=justify&gt;Ostatnie dni 
potwierdzaj± obawy, i¿ roczny rz±d ustawiony jest pod jedn± transakcjê. Socha 
odwo³a³ wiceministrów skarbu, pomimo i¿ ministrowie mieli wstrzymaæ siê z 
decyzjami do 14 maja 2004 roku, czyli g³osowania wotum zaufania dla gabinetu 
premiera. Dlaczego to w³a¶nie wiceministrowie skarbu pañstwa okazali siê sol± w 
oku, na tyle dra¿liw±, by ³amaæ dopiero co wstêpne deklaracje rz±du! Czy¿by z 
obawy o brak wotum zaufania dla gabinetu Belki? Tworzenie faktów dokonanych i \
dymisjonowanie  wiceministrów z obawy przed w³asn± dymisj± to jest dzia³anie i \
haniebne i  oszukañcze. Panie Przewodnicz±cy Socha, jakie zobowi±zania Pan 
realizuje?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

Are you using loop-AES and ciphers package kernel modules? If you are trying

cryptoloop/cryptoapi twofish does not understand twofish with 160 bit keys.

Hi,

I've successfully set up loop-AES-v2.1b on my system, encrypting
several partitions on internal and external hard disks.

Since I'm just starting to use it on a daily basis I'd like to know
about your experiences, especially the bad ones. Maybe there's a

hello,

I'd like to know how Loop-AES (used with mulitkey mode, key stored on
external media, root directory encrypted and booting from CD-ROM) and PPDD
compare in terms of security.

In the PPDD documentation, Allan states that
"the first 1024 bytes of the file are reserved for keys and other control
information and are never read or written by the device.[...] In the
encrypted part of the block are the keys for the database and iv data
needed for the encryption process. [...] The key derived from the master
pass phrase is held in the
block and is encrypted with the key derived from the working pass phrase."

So, is the key actually stored on disk?

Furthermore, PPDD seems to use 17 randomly generated keys, Loop-AES uses 64
AES keys to encrypt/decrypt sectors.
Does this automatically mean that Loop-AES is more secure concerning this
point?

Both PPDD and Loop-AES(gpg) seem to use /dev/urandom or /dev/random.
Now, if I want to use another (CS)PRNG, I could use it only with Loop-AES?

Loop-AES has the option for password seeding and key iteration count to slow
down dictionary attacks. Do you know whether PPDD has a similar protection?

I speculate that PPDD has no significant problems with using Blowfish and
the 64bit blocksize because this becomes only a problem when encrypting
every sector with a single key.

PPDD uses this whitening process, to keep the IVs secret. Is there any match
in Loop-AES?

Dowdeswell/Ioannidis remark that only their cgd uses a secure key generation
method (pkcs#5 pbkdf2) and the other approaches (including loop-aes) use a
simpler hash transform. How important is that drawback?


Maybe these questions are already redundant because PPDD seems to be
abandoned.
Anyways, if some of you find the time I would be thankful for any hint and
things I missed here.

Thx for your help in advance.

greets, Richard

PS: thx to all ppl writing open source crypto :D

I did. But saying that A has feature x and B has feature y is different from
evaluating the overall impact of x and y on the strength of A and B
respectively.
Of course I can eavaluate different aspects of encryption systems separately
by going through the literature and saying: this system uses a secure hash
transform and this system none at all, Serpent's security margin is widely
seen to be more comfortable than the one of AES etc.
But when it comes to evaluating the overall security of a disk encryption
system, I leave that to crypto experts I hoped to find here.
I'll have to wait for Halcrow's paper on Linux symposium (though he probably
won't evaluate PPDD).

Nevertheless thx for the informative part of your (educational) pamphlet :D

&gt;&gt; The questions you ask sound like homework, [ ... ] not the sort of
&gt;&gt; questions one would ask out of a genuine desire to understand the
&gt;&gt; issues.

tacron&gt; Incorrect.

You would say that, wouldn't you? :-) For example, consider among
several other obvious hints the lack of personal identification on your
email address, which might suggest to the cynical :-) a desire not to be
caught out soliciting ``assistance''.

However, I will try to pretend that I believe your bare "incorrect"
statement and be more patient and provide some detailed exposition of
the complexities I perceive and that you maybe can't be asked to
worry about.

But please double check with your friendly neighbourhood professional
cryptanalist anything I write because I am just an interested spectator,
and I am neither a criptographer nor a cryptanalyst, and just about the
only thing I really know about the subject is that it is far more subtle
than I think I know. :-)

[ ... ]

&gt;&gt; "automatically mean" is a meaningless sequence of words. Perhaps that
&gt;&gt; should have been written "necessarily mean", but if so then it is
&gt;&gt; still pretty pointless because ``security'' is a matter of judgement,
&gt;&gt; not logical necessity.

tacron&gt; bla bla

It's not "bla bla", for me it is very the essence of the discussion. I
reckon that:

``Security'' is not an automatic consequence of how many/which features,
  it is a complex story. Bauer in his cryptanalysis book argues that the
  Enigma machine, especially as updated, was unbreakable at the time. But
  its users were sloppy. And sometimes more features mean less ``security''.

``Security'' can only be estimated semi-reliably by professional
  cryptanalysts and given a cryptosystem architecture and a threat
  model; a disk encryption scheme is a mere component of a cryptosystem,
  (of which you give very few details) and I haven't noticed any mention
  of a threat model either.

``Security'' is intimately related to cost: both the cryptosystem
  architecture and threat model must included expected budgets for
  protection and attack vs. the value of preventing or achieving a
  breach. Without mention of money values even having a cryptosystem
  architecture and threat models is not that useful.

Analogies are usually bad, but consider the meanignfulness of questions
like:

  ``Does an engine with six cylinders automatically mean that it is more
  reliable than an engine with four cylinders concerning this point?''.

  ``Is a CPU with 250 instructions always more powerful than a CPU with
  110 instructions as far as this point is concerned?''

&gt;&gt; Also, and more importantly, any question like "more secure" at this
&gt;&gt; level of detail is ridiculous without a detailed threat model and lots
&gt;&gt; of pretty formal work, or a team of professional cryptanalists checking
&gt;&gt; it out.

tacron&gt; Could you please answer the question?

Sorry, my guess is that the question is pointless/unanswerable. This
guess in itself may convey valuable information, but hey, that's just my
delusion, you are welcome to recoil from sharing it.

For me your insistence for an answer reinforces my other delusion that
your questions are "not the sort of questions one would ask out of a
genuine desire to understand the issues."

Perhaps this is also because of my occasional feeling that you only care
to get a definite answer to an otherwise pointless question because your
teacher does award points to it in marking your essay (``Does the use of
64 vs. 17 keys by itself mean that it is more secure other things being
equal? Answer yes or no, correct answer worth 15 points''); if so
perhaps he can't be asked to understand the depth of the subject he
teaches, or just cynical about teaching.

So, not only I reckon that questions about "more secure" based on
details like the number of keys are just pointless without a statement
of the expected threats and the cryptosystem architecture; some people
may even think that having many subkeys is barely useful; it may even be
regarded to be a risk, never mind the specific number of keys.

Consider this argument, which is not necessarily good, but to me seems
to have some merit in some cases: having many keys, no matter whether 17
or 64, means that probably they cannot be easily memorized. If they
cannot, they have to be stored _somewhere_, encrypted with a key that
has to be memorized (all this said with a particular but obvious family
of cryptosystem architectures in mind).

Does this improve or reduce ``security'' whatever that is? It's not so
obvious, and may depend quite a bit on the threat model, because it
seems to me that it trades off some data crypto hazards for some key
management hazards.

Maybe if you have a single not too complex key you can just hold it in
your head. Given that some plausible threat models are mostly about key
management mishaps, this might be more ``secure'' than storing the
vector of real encryption keys somewhere outside your head, and keeping
in your head just the passphrase with which you encrypt that.

Then there are counterarguments, like that you can/should put the keys
well separated from the data (as part of your original question), but
this creates different key management hazards, and so on.

Then there are countercounterarguments; for example that if a key is
only in your head you know for sure at least some cases when it has been
revealed, because you did it, but then there are keyboard loggers that
mean you may have revealed the key without realizing it, and so on.

Again, it all depends on the threat model and the cryptosystem
architecture.

[ ... ]

tacron&gt; I speculate that PPDD has no significant problems with using
tacron&gt; Blowfish and the 64bit blocksize because this becomes only a
tacron&gt; problem when encrypting every sector with a single key.

&gt;&gt; Good for you that you enjoy speculating about such matters.

tacron&gt; Thx :P

Glad for the appreciation. However I'll now comment on your enjoyable
speculation, just to illustrate why it seems a bit fanciful to me, in
particular this bare premise:

  tacron&gt; becomes only a problem when encrypting every sector with a
  tacron&gt; single key.

This statement seems to me to be based on the assumption that what is
relevant is block size vs. *percentage* (100% vs. 5.9% or 1.5% or ...,
depending on the number of keys) instead of absolute quantity (and
likelyhood of known plaintext in it) of ciphertext potentially available
to an adversary. I also wonder if it wouldn't be more useful to worry
about key size instead of block size wrt to percentage or absolute
amount of ciphertext.

If encrypting an 80GB partition with something like 17 keys, the
adversary might get almost 5GB of ciphertext per key (some of which may
be known plaintext), and perhaps that is still a bit of a concern with
64 bit blocks (or should one worry about key size rather than the block
size?), _if_ the block size should be related to the absolute amount of
ciphertext one expects the adversary to be able to get, not its
percentage.

To my untrained eye it would seem more worthwhile to fancy speculating
about absolute amount of data encrypted per key vs. key size, rather
than percentage of data encrypted per key vs. block size, but you seem
happier to speculate about the latter.

  More generally, it seems to me that one of the challenges with disk
  encryption schemes is the large amount, especially compared to many
  other uses of encryption, of ciphertext produced with the same key
  (and the high likelyhood some of it corresponds to known plaintext)
  that might fall into the hands of the adversary. This may be a worry,
  not just because cryptanalysis may be easier (I guess wildly here) but
  also because the consequence of a breach may be wide.

  AFAIK for encryption of communication channels keys are often
  automatically renegotiated every X bytes and/or Y milliseconds, and
  this looks to me to be pretty hard to do for a disk with anything like
  the same spatial or temporal frequency. But I am digressing from
  happy speculations about block sizes and percentage of ciphertext. :-)

  alatham&gt; secret in the same way as the encryption keys and that the
  alatham&gt; scrambling action diffuses a change in any one byte
  alatham&gt; throughout the block.

My suspicions involve also a misreading of this sentence: to me it
states that the IV keys for whitening are kept secret _before_
scrambling, "in the same way as the encryption keys" are kept secret,
which is described as follows:

  http://Koeln.CCC.DE/archiv/drt/crypto/ppdd.Specification.txt

   «The key for the 1024 byte block is derived from the pass phrase and
    is used to encrypt most of this block in ecb mode. In the encrypted
    part of the block are the keys for the database and iv data needed
    for the encryption process.»

Which sounds to me not quite like "uses this whitening process, to keep
the IVs secret". The opposite seems more applicable to me: whitening
_uses_ the IVs kept secret by the control block passphrase.

It is also said explicitly that the purpose of whitening is to frustrate
before/after analysis here (and see below too):

  alatham&gt; If an attacker gets a "before" and "after" copy he can see
  alatham&gt; that a 512 byte block has changed but has no idea where in
  alatham&gt; the block the change took place.

The scrambling seems to be just just a _data_ block superencryption
scheme, rather unrelated to the a goal like "to keep the IVs secret"
(the IVs are _metadata_).

tacron&gt; http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2001-09/msg00063.html

That the purpose of whitening it to frustrate before/after analysis is
also what I misunderstand from this other detailed description:

  http://Koeln.CCC.DE/archiv/drt/crypto/ppdd.Specification.txt

   «This process requires an IV and this is derived from the block number
    and from a table of IVs held in the control block.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      The whitening process also provides an IV which is used in the cbc
      encryption of the block using a key from the control block.

      The control block contains 17 keys and 61 random 4 byte IVs.

      The key used on a block is derived by dividing the block number by
      17 and using the remainder as a subscript to the key array.

      The whitening IVs are the block number itself and the IVs from the
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      control block derived by dividing the block number by 59 and 61	
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      and using these remainders and using these as subscripts.

    The result is that no block is encrypted the same way. Also any
    change in the data in a block results in a completely different 512
    byte block after encryption.»

Now, let's assume for a moment for the sake of argument that PPDD "uses
this whitening process, to keep the IVs secret": then, which IVs does
whitening "keep secret"? Also, if the IVs are kept secret somewhere,
where? Neither is so obvious to me.

My impression is that the IVs whitening uses are "derived" from the
61-IV vector in the control block, and those are not in any way subject
to whitening. The "key used in the block" is also selected from the
17-key vector in the control block, and that is also kept secret by the
passphrase. As to where, in data blocks there is no space to store the
IVs, and in the control block they are kept secret by the passphrase.
Misteries of the whitening masters! :-)

In passing, note the innocence of the author when he concludes that
thanks to this particular superencryption scheme:

   «[ ... ] the scrambling action diffuses a change in any one byte
    throughout the block.»

   «Also any change in the data in a block results in a completely
    different 512 byte block after encryption.»

Amazing claims! :-) I am also rather perplexed that whitening «"scrambles"
the whole of a 512 byte block before encryption» instead of *after*
encryption.

[ ... ]

&gt;&gt; It would have been nice if you had found the time to read _carefully_
&gt;&gt; the paper that describes PPDD, the loop-AES documentation, and the
&gt;&gt; sources, and some web discussions about these subjects...

tacron&gt; I did.

You would say that, of course, and yes, yes, I believe that and in the
tooth fairy :-) and also that you are not just trying to scrounge some
quick'n'dirty stuff to cut and paste in your assignment. :-)

Yours statements above suggest to me that you may have read (perhaps
belatedly) something about whitening, but that it must have been a very
superficial read, because despite the fairly clear and repeated
statements that the purpose of whitening is to frustrate some sort of
before/after analysis even _in the quote you provide_, you only
mentioned as its purpose to keep some IVs secret.

But reading carelessly is not the only problem I imagine; to me it seems
pretty likely that you never bothered to read the loop-AES documentation
or its sources, because you seemed quite unaware that since 2002
(according to the 'ChangeLog') the loop-AES driver supports iterations,
or that it does not use any random number generator itself.

To me it seems fairly funny that you are trying to compare loop-AES with
PPDD without apparently reading their documentation or sources with care
if at all, or else it's the attitude of a lazy guy that just wants to
make his term paper with minimum cut-and-paste effort. :-)

tacron&gt; But saying that A has feature x and B has feature y is different
tacron&gt; from evaluating the overall impact of x and y on the strength of
tacron&gt; A and B respectively.

Ahhhh, but you asked questions like "automatically means" ... "more
secure" as to a detail like 17 vs. 64 keys. Even if just as "concerning
this point" that seems to be a bit more ambitious than listing features,
assuming one gets the features right.

tacron&gt; Of course I can eavaluate different aspects of encryption
tacron&gt; systems separately by going through the literature

If only it were so easy! And "evaluate" is not the same as ``list''.

tacron&gt; and saying: this system uses a secure hash transform and this
tacron&gt; system none at all, Serpent's security margin is widely seen to
tacron&gt; be more comfortable than the one of AES etc.

Consider performance, another slippery subject: at least one can say it
is measured in ``somethings'' per unit of time. One can argue about the
``somethings'', and one can argue about how to measure them, but it is
pretty obvious (absolute) performance should be a ``speed''.

For ``security'' I cannot even imagine in what units it is expressed;
and some people even think it is process and not a quantity.

Even making a list of features probably does not help a lot, and making
an inaccurate list without reading carefully or at all some of the
relevant docs or sources may help very little.

tacron&gt; But when it comes to evaluating the overall security of a disk
tacron&gt; encryption system, I leave that to crypto experts I hoped to
tacron&gt; find here.

Unlucky! Most of those people work for the ``good'' (or ``bad'') guys,
and poor spectators like me can just offer some cautionary warnings to
the lazy :-).

Then I suspect that any "crypto experts" would be pretty reluctant to
indulge your wildly speculative imagination by "evaluating the overall
security" of anything outside decently specified terms of reference
(cryptosystem architecture, threat model, budgets), but I have never
even talked with one (not that I would know even if I did, as Bauer says
it is very dangerous for a professional cryptanalyst to be known as such).

Also, have you ever read Eco's novel "Foucault's pendulum"? It says that
the number one rule among occultists (includign apprentice sorcerers) is
like ``Those who claim they know, don't, and those who claim they don't
know, do''. :-)

For cryptanalysts it is more like ``Those who talk don't know, those who
know don't talk''. Note that I am talking a lot. :-)

But then most definitely I am not a cryptanalyst or a "crypto expert"; I
have never even tried to solve a decryption problem in a puzzle magazine
on a train trip, it just bores me (like crosswords, etc.).

tacron&gt; I'll have to wait for Halcrow's paper on Linux symposium (though
tacron&gt; he probably won't evaluate PPDD).

Perhaps, but even evaluating the _details_ of a disk encryption scheme
is not trivial (consider the above discussion of the merits of having
multiple keys vs. one key), because even the details can be more
``secure'' (whatever that means) under some threat model and not under
others, and in what kind of cryptosystem architecture the disk encryptor
is embedded.

&gt;From the description of his talk:

  http://WWW.LinuxSymposium.org/2004/view_abstract.php?content_key=55

it seems he will be reasonably just do "a survey of filesystem security
options", quite a bit more doable than evaluating ``security'' as in:

  tacron&gt; I'd like to know how Loop-AES (used with mulitkey mode, key
  tacron&gt; stored on external media, root directory encrypted and booting
  tacron&gt; from CD-ROM) and PPDD compare in terms of security.

Could this poor Halcrow guy foretell which cryptosystems and threats and
budgets are involved in most/every case? Do you? :-)

However, let me add here a personal call of judgement: I like loop-AES,
in large part because I have read Jari Ruusu docs and occasional
comments and I like his judgement because he seems to think things
through, and this gives me confidence that he does his homework, is
aware of the existence of limitations and oblique risks, and tries to
fix or avoid trouble.

For me the cost of cryptosystem architecture/threat model/cost estimates
and hiring a team of professional cryptanlysts wildly exceeds the
possible cost of really making sure nobody can read my email :-), and so
I use the crude proxy of trusting the judgement of the author as

tacron&gt; Nevertheless thx for the informative part of your (educational)
tacron&gt; pamphlet :D

Thanks for the appreciation!

Subject: Re: Loop-AES vs. PPDD


&gt; For example, consider among
&gt; several other obvious hints the lack of personal identification on your
&gt; email address, which might suggest to the cynical :-) a desire not to be
&gt; caught out soliciting ``assistance''.
------------------------------------------
I give my main email address (with my real name) only to friends.

So far, I haven't found any scientific application of cryptography in
medical science.
------------------------------------------

&gt; It's not "bla bla", for me it is very the essence of the discussion. I
&gt; reckon that:
---------------------------------------
the bla bla referred to the "automatically - necessarily".
--------------------------------------
&gt; tacron&gt; Could you please answer the question?
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, my guess is that the question is pointless/unanswerable. [...]
-----------------------------------------------
The "could you please answer the question" referred to 17 keys ppdd vs. 64
keys loop-aes.
------------------------------------------------
&gt; Consider this argument, which is not necessarily good, but to me seems
&gt; to have some merit in some cases: having many keys, no matter whether 17
&gt; or 64, means that probably they cannot be easily memorized. If they
&gt; cannot, they have to be stored _somewhere_, encrypted with a key that
&gt; has to be memorized (all this said with a particular but obvious family
&gt; of cryptosystem architectures in mind).
&gt;
&gt; Does this improve or reduce ``security'' whatever that is? It's not so
&gt; obvious, and may depend quite a bit on the threat model, because it
&gt; seems to me that it trades off some data crypto hazards for some key
&gt; management hazards.
---------------------------------------------
I guess it improves. Even if you use 17 or 64 keys and not one for
encrypting the sectors, you still have an incredibly large amount of data
for statistical, differential or probabilistic attacks in the future.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe if you have a single not too complex key you can just hold it in
&gt; your head. Given that some plausible threat models are mostly about key
&gt; management mishaps, this might be more ``secure'' than storing the
&gt; vector of real encryption keys somewhere outside your head, and keeping
&gt; in your head just the passphrase with which you encrypt that.
------------------------------------------
Hmm, maybe you're getting something wrong here. Having more keys to encrypt
the sectors seems to be better than just using one key or 17 or 64 keys.
PHK (GBDE): "A salted MD5 hash over the sectoroffset "cherry-picks" which
masterkey bytes participate in the MD5 hash which generates the "kkey" for
each particular sector. The kkey AES/128/CBC encrypts the PRNG produced
single-use key which AES/128/CBC encrypts the actual sector data."
&gt;
&gt;   tacron&gt; becomes only a problem when encrypting every sector with a
&gt;   tacron&gt; single key.
&gt;
&gt; This statement seems to me to be based on the assumption that what is
&gt; relevant is block size vs. *percentage* (100% vs. 5.9% or 1.5% or ...,
&gt; depending on the number of keys) instead of absolute quantity (and
&gt; likelyhood of known plaintext in it) of ciphertext potentially available
&gt; to an adversary. I also wonder if it wouldn't be more useful to worry
&gt; about key size instead of block size wrt to percentage or absolute
&gt; amount of ciphertext.
----------------------------------
No. it relates to "although the 64-bit block size is now considered too
short, because encrypting more than 232 data blocks can begin to leak
information about the plaintext"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29
However, I don't know when this 2^32 (around 4 billion) blocks is reached.

&gt;
&gt;   More generally, it seems to me that one of the challenges with disk
&gt;   encryption schemes is the large amount, especially compared to many
&gt;   other uses of encryption, of ciphertext produced with the same key
&gt;   (and the high likelyhood some of it corresponds to known plaintext)
&gt;   that might fall into the hands of the adversary.
------------------------------------
Absolutely right.

Yes, a fairly interesting discourse if one whitens
the snide comments out. You show a certain amount
of maturity to not rise to the flamebait tossed at you.

I would also note that none of the code authors of either
of the two disk crypto systems have entered the discussion. 
Of course I know HVR is quite busy with a job so he's 
excused :-)

Hello,

I try to handle a partition encrypted with SuSE's loop_fish2 module. I
read http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/ciphers.README and
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/loop-AES.README and I've got a patched
version of util-linux.

When I do a 
~&gt; mount -t ext3 /dev/md0 /export/ -o \
loop,encryption=twofish160,phash=rmd160,loinit=1

I get the error:
"ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument, requested cipher or key
length(160 bits) not supported by kernel"

With every other values instead of 160 he don't gives me that error.
Even not with senseless values like $RANDOM.

Hi,

I am successfully using loop-AES package with kernel
2.4.25. I have partition that is encrypted with a
single passphrase. For better security I would rather
like to use a gpg keyfile, but I do not want to wipe
the partition and make a completely new setup.

Is it possible to put the passphrase in a gpg keyfile
and have losetup use this file instead of asking for
the passphrase itself? How can I create the keyfile?

Any help welcome.

I was using linux kernel 2.4.21 prior to now.  I had patched it
with one of the crypto patches.  I forget what I had to do to get
that to work.  It was difficult.  But it was working.  I was able
to create an encrypted filesystem using the loopback device.
Great.

But recently I had to grab the linux 2.4.26 kernel to support my
new motherboard.  It has cryptoapi already in there.   I turned
on all of the crypto modules.  I compiled the kernel and rebooted.
But alas,  losetup reported that it doesn't recognize "aes" as a
valid crypto cipher.  I'm actually using blowfish and aes,  by
the way.  Both of them don't work.  When I cat /proc/crypto,
it shows all of the crypto ciphers are loaded in the kernel,
by the way.

So what do I have to do to get kernel 2.4.26 to the point where
I can create an encrypted filesystem?  I don't care too much
about backwards compatibility.  Does anyone have a step by
step list of instructions on how to do that?

I know there's something about grabbing and possibly having to
patch the util-linux stuff so that it can use the crypto ciphers?  Do
we have to do that with this kernel?  Which util-linux version
should I be using?

Then there's something about cryptoloop patches?

Very confused.

Steve,

loop-aes (http://sourceforge.net/projects/loop-aes/) and
the cryptoapi interface are two separate crypto implementations.

To my knowledge, cryptoapi cannot read the loop-aes devices.

Was it loop-aes you were using previously? It sounds like it.

I suggest reading the README at the loop-aes site.

Daniel.

Thomas,

Thanks for the info.

I tried a fresh install of the kernel (2.4.26) and patched it with:
  patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0

Then I turned on crypto loop device in the Block Devices menu.
I recompiled.  All went smoothly.

But losetup still doesn't recognize any of the crypto ciphers.

Here's the output:

% losetup -e aes -k 256 /dev/loop7 /etc/encrypted.data
The cipher does not exist, or a cipher module needs to be loaded into the 
kernel
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument

That's the same output that I had before when I was just using the
crypto API stuff (without jari's patch for cryptoloop).

I then looked,  and I saw that when I selected the cryptoloop module,
it disabled the crypto API for me.  And I don't see any modules at:

% cat /proc/crypto

(Ie,  nothing appears when I cat it.)

So apparently this means you can have one or the other,  but not
both,  eh?  Either you use cryptoloop or you use the built-in Crypto API?

This doesn't make sense at all.  Why use cryptoloop?  What does it
do?  I thought the Crypto API did everything?

And do I need a particular version of losetup (util-linux package)?
If so,  which one?  And do I need to patch it with a patch file?  If
so,  which one?

Someone suggested I use loop-aes?  I have to check into that.
But does that mean that it only supports AES and not blowfish etc?
If so,  I want blowfish and the rest.  I don't just want AES.  Having
a fast version of AES is nice,  but not necessary.

I dunno.  I've been patching my kernels with the crypto patches
since kernel 2.0.x.  It's never been easy.  And nobody ever seems
to have a nice readme.txt file available to do it.  I'm always left to
beg for help on this mailing list.  It's frustrating.

&gt;The kernel, as you said, contains the crypto but it doesn't support
&gt;cryptoloop.
&gt;Try
&gt;http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/testing/patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a step by

&gt;
&gt;this is for creating a encrypted /tmp using the vanilla crypto stuff in the 
&gt;kernel + the cryptoloop-jari
&gt;patch, works for 2.4.26:
&gt;
&gt;patch, configure, compile and reboot the kernel
&gt;
&gt;losetup -e aes -k 256 /dev/loop0 &lt;your partition or file[1]&gt;
&gt;mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
&gt;mount -o nosuid,nodev -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /tmp
&gt;chmod 1777 /tmp
&gt;
&gt;[1] dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmpcrypt bs=1M count=&lt;size of /tmp in M&gt; for
&gt;example

What version of losetup and mount are you using? 
2.12 is whats needed iirc.

Ok, thats odd.

&gt; So apparently this means you can have one or the other,  but not
&gt; both,  eh?  Either you use cryptoloop or you use the built-in Crypto API?

I use both:
$ grep CRYPTO /usr/src/patches/configs/config-2.4.25 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP=y	# Cryptoloop
CONFIG_CRYPTO=y			# Crypto API stuff 
CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC=y
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_NULL is not set
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD4=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD5=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_DES=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLOWFISH=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_TWOFISH=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SERPENT=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CAST5=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CAST6=m
CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEFLATE=y
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST is not set
CONFIG_CRYPTO=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=y

&gt; This doesn't make sense at all.  Why use cryptoloop?  What does it
&gt; do?  I thought the Crypto API did everything?

The cryptoloop patch (dont ask me why it isn't included in the vanilla
kernel, with the API) enables you to mount encrypted loop devices. Thats
it. The crypto api is there to make it easier to use crypto in other
patches or programs. Take grsecurity for example, it requires sha256,
and since it uses the kernel api it doesnt need to be included in the
grsecurity patch.

&gt; And do I need a particular version of losetup (util-linux package)?
&gt; If so,  which one?  And do I need to patch it with a patch file?  If
&gt; so,  which one?

2.12 or later.

&gt; Someone suggested I use loop-aes?  I have to check into that.
&gt; But does that mean that it only supports AES and not blowfish etc?
&gt; If so,  I want blowfish and the rest.  I don't just want AES.  Having
&gt; a fast version of AES is nice,  but not necessary.

loop-aes is nice and it does support the usual algorithms via an
external patch. The big drawback is that mount, umount, losetup, swapon
and swapoff has to be patched and recompiled and loop-aes and cryptoloop
doesnt work with eachother. It's a mess basically.
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/

&gt; I dunno.  I've been patching my kernels with the crypto patches

Check out the loop-aes "page", it got some nice docs.
Have you checked out http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Cryptoloop-HOWTO/ ?

To make things worse for us, but better security wise, the use a
different system in 2.6 now.

Contrary to lies that some people keep spreading, loop-AES has never
required kernel patches.

&gt; The big drawback is that mount, umount, losetup, swapon
&gt; and swapoff has to be patched and recompiled and loop-aes and cryptoloop
&gt; doesnt work with eachother.

Loop-AES can use cryptoloop's broken and backdoored on-disk formats just
fine when told to do that using mount options. Cryptoloop just cannot be
used in more secure mode that loop-AES and ciphers packages provide.

Well, i was talking about the loop-aes ciphers-patch
(http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/ciphers/ to be clear). But maybe that
has changed, so that patch has been included in loop-aes? Or am i
missing something?

&gt; &gt; The big drawback is that mount, umount, losetup, swapon
&gt; &gt; and swapoff has to be patched and recompiled and loop-aes and cryptoloop
&gt; &gt; doesnt work with eachother.
&gt; 
&gt; Loop-AES can use cryptoloop's broken and backdoored on-disk formats just
&gt; fine when told to do that using mount options. Cryptoloop just cannot be
&gt; used in more secure mode that loop-AES and ciphers packages provide.

Yes, so why use loop-aes with unpatched mount, umount, etc if there are
no benefits? Hence, to use loop-aes you'll need to patch and recompile
or you could just stick with cryptoloop.
I could have been more clear when it came to the compatibility issue,
but what i meant was that a loop-aes encrypted loop cant be decrypted
with cryptoloop or vice versa.

It is interesting to note the watermark attack is effective on 
single-key loop-aes. How does one use multi-key mode though?

I use loop-aes because cryptoloop is deadly slow, even on very fast CPUs. 
I guess this is because they don't have any asm crypto, it's all 
unoptimized plain c.

Just so I have this straight - basically if you have a database
containing the entire keyspace of a given key length, you can brute
force a key as quickly as O(lg n) if the encrypting key isn't salted?

cryptoloop support was added in 2.12.

&gt; I'm not sure how you accomplished that.  Because whenever I use
&gt; "make xconfig" and select "cryptoloop" from the menu,  it automatically
&gt; turns off all of the CryptoAPI stuff.  I mean,  I go back to the
&gt; CryptoAPI stuff,  and it's all grayed out.  I turn off the cryptoloop
&gt; item in the Block Devices menu,  and then go back to the CryptoAPI
&gt; section,  and all of the CryptoAPI stuff is back and no longer
&gt; grayed out.  This tells me that someone doesn't want you to use
&gt; both.  Why?  Who knows.  But I could always try manually
&gt; including both in the config file and see what happens.

I've never used 'xconfig' and it works well when just using 'config'.

&gt; Ah.  So if I use CryptoAPI instead of loop-aes,  then all of the
&gt; util-linux stuff should work without any patches?  

Yes, if you use 2.12 or later.

&gt; But if I use
&gt; loop-aes,  then I need to patch util-linux?   Does that sound
&gt; right?

As Jari wrote yesterday, you can use the normal util-linux for loop-aes
as well, but functionality will be lost.

&gt; So if that is so,  then my problem seems to be that I can't
&gt; select in "make xconfig" the cryptoloop item and the
&gt; CryptoAPI items at the same time.  No patching of util-linux
&gt; would be necessary it sounds like.  I just need to manually
&gt; enter the config options to turn on cryptoloop and CryptoAPI
&gt; at the same time.  That should get me up and running.

Hopefully :)

Step a)
Create a file with the passphrase in a single line with your favourite Editor.

Step b v1) (Simple symmetric encryption)
gpg -c &lt;file&gt;

Step b v2) (Whatever you like best)
gpg &lt;Whatever you options are&gt; &lt;file&gt;


Done. You can use the resulting file as a keyfile.

To me it seems that, even if it depends on the kind of threat model you=

Now, if you intend instead to create a new random private key, and use

Under this kind of threat model your approach makes some sense. But I
suppose your threat model is somewhat optimistic...

Consider extending the threat model with this little twist: the
``hacker'' is destiny, and destiny makes you lose the USB memory
stick. Would you like the consequence? Perhaps yes, perhaps not.

Is an increased possibility of losing access to your data less important
than a decreased probability of someone else's accessing it? I don't
know, but think carefully about what matters to you, and the kind of
risk and precautions you can take in each case.

[ ... ]

etwcn&gt; I never thought a re-encryption of a parition would be
etwcn&gt; possible. Where can I find any addidtional information
etwcn&gt; on that subject?

The documentation of 'aespipe' and 'man aespipe'. Having done a little
search, this page contains a mini intro:

  http://www.geekcomix.com/cgi-bin/classnotes/wiki.pl?UNIX03/Encryption_With_Aespipe

etwcn&gt; I guess this includes some signifcant risk of loosing all the
etwcn&gt; data on the disk, in case something goes wrong.

Any data writing en-masse entails a risk of data loss if there are no
backups.

As to the risks, consider this warning form the author:

  http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2003-05/msg00138.html

[ ... ]

etwcn&gt; The AES-loop readme contains some information on the differences
etwcn&gt; in security for the various encryption options. It sounds quite
etwcn&gt; plausible to me.

Uhmmm, this can be a very dangerous attitude. The README discusses
issues related to _cipher_ security, which may be a very small aspect of
``security'', whatever that is.

Hey,  I just wanted to send a quick not that I was able to get the
crypto stuff working for kernel 2.4.26.

The problem was that the "make xconfig" system wasn't letting
me turn on the selection of the CryptoAPI and the cryptoloop
at the same time.  I had to use "make menuconfig" instead.  That
worked!

That was a really strange thing.  I have no idea why it was
happening.  I repeated this problem several times to show that
it wasn't a fluke.  It's just that "make xconfig" has a bug.

Anyway,  thanks to everyone for helping me out.  And I think I'm
gonna switch to Jari's loop-aes after all.  The note about there
being potential vulnerabilities in the normal cryptoapi stuff
was kind of frightening.

</body></email><email><emailId>20040630182042</emailId><senderName>"Doug Campbell"</senderName><senderEmail>dcampbell@zonemail.net</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2004-06-30 18:20:42-0400</timestampReceived><subject>loop-AES: Boot from CD-ROM + encrypted root partition</subject><body>

I successfully got the loop-AES to work encrypting my root partition.  I
know want to see if I can switch to booting from the CD-ROM so that my
entire drive can be encrypted.

As I looked over the direction in the loop-AES.Readme file, there were a few
things towards the end of the instructions that confused me.  I have four
questions below.

Question 1: Step 11 says to do the following:

11) Contents of /etc/lilo.conf configuration file are below. Two copies of
    '/dev/loop7' on first two lines refer to temporary file backed loop
    mount that is mounted on /mnt later in step 13a.

    boot=/dev/loop7
    disk=/dev/loop7
      bios=0x00
      sectors=36
      heads=2
      cylinders=80
    geometric
    compact
    read-only
    prompt
    timeout=30
    vga=normal
    backup=/dev/null
    install=text
    map=/mnt/map
    image=/mnt/vmlinuz
      label=Linux
      append="init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix"
      initrd=/mnt/initrd.gz
      root=/dev/ram0


I am using GRUB, do I just do something like the following?

    boot=/dev/loop7
    disk=/dev/loop7
      bios=0x00
      sectors=36
      heads=2
      cylinders=80
    geometric
    compact
    read-only
    prompt
    timeout=30
    vga=normal
    backup=/dev/null
    install=text
    map=/mnt/map
title Linux using loop-AES
	root (hd0,0)
	kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix
	initrd /initrd.gz


Question 2: In Step 12 it says:

12) Build new /boot/initrd.gz

        ./build-initrd.sh /boot/initrd.conf

but I noticed that not all of the configuration options that I initially
changed in build-initrd.sh are in the initrd.conf file in Step 10a.  Do I
add these to that file or will it use what I have set in the buid-initrd.sh
file as defaults and only change the options that I have specifically set in
initrd.conf?


Question 3:  In Step 20 it says:

20) Clean up and reboot your computer. The 'dd' command attempts to
    overwrite gpg encrypted root partition key file and 'mkswap' command
    restores "temporary file system on swap" /dev/hda3 back to swap usage.

        dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/rootkey.gpg bs=64k count=1 conv=notrunc
        umount /mnt
        sync
        mkswap /dev/hda3
        sync
        reboot

Am I rebooting the computer with my rescue disk again?

If so, after doing so, do I need to first mount /dev/hda3 again?  The dd
command above seems to be trying to overwrite a file on a filesystem that
isn't mounted.  But maybe I am missing something here?

If not, what am I rebooting the computer with?  The boot CD that I just
made?


Question 4:  Do I need the /dev/hda1 or /boot parition after I finish?  If
so, I didn't seem to encrypt it yet so can I encrypt it in the same way that
I did for /dev/hda2, the root partition?

I hope that these questions are clear and I am sorry that my understanding
is lacking.  Thanks for taking the time to help me out.

Doug

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Makefile updated to work with 2.6.6-rc3 kernel.
- build-initrd.sh changed to consume 40 KB less kernel RAM when used with
  gpg encrypted key files. This change may break really old gpg versions
  that choke with read-only mounted keyrings.
- Kernel patch versions now require removal of drivers/block/loop.c and
  include/linux/loop.h source files before patch can be applied.
- Added back aes.c code that avoids byte swaps on big endian boxes. This
  change improves performance on all non-x86 computers.
- Security fix: restrict length of passphrase to max 4094 bytes when it is
  read from file descriptor using "mount -p 0" option.
- Added ioctl32 compatibility that is needed on 64bit boxes running 32bit
  losetup/mount programs (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
- Fixed build-initrd.sh incompatibility with distros that have system
  libraries in /lib64 instead of /lib

Looks like humbolt.nl.linux.org needs to firewall out 64.235.32.0/19 ?

The list isn't dead, but the admin is horribly overworked
and doesn't always have time to read it.  I've added the
spam sending IP addresses to PSBL, but I suspect the longer
term solution is to upgrade nl.linux.org to a spamassassin
with SURBL support (and to keep my own SURBL blocklist based
on the mail I get to my spamtraps ;))

Hi,

I don't know if this is the better list to ask it, if not say me :-)

I want to use deflate module but I can't.

I can use other modules without problems:
pinux:/mnt/dades# losetup -e aes-256 /dev/loop0 prova.ext2
Password:
pinux:/mnt/dades#

the modules that I have load are:
cryptoloop              3200  1
aes                    31392  1

(I am using Debian Sid with loop-aes-utils package, version 2.12a-1; and
Kernel 2.6.6-rc3)

Now, I want to use deflate module to compress some file system:

pinux:/mnt/dades# losetup -e deflate /dev/loop0 prova.ext2
Password:
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument, requested cipher or key length
(128 bits) not supported by kernel
pinux:/mnt/dades#

I have tried with deflate-0, deflate-256, etc.

Are there any way to use deflate module to compress a file system in "real
time" with write support? (not read-only, I can use the loopcompress
module)

Thank you for your attention, and excuse me my bad and quickly English :-)

I will try with Kernel 2.4.26, and the patches, etc. but if somebody knows
anything tell me :-)

Hi,

I'm currently working on a ARM920T based network processor with arm-linux
kernel 2.6.5.
This device has a crypto hardware accelerator dedicated to IPsec.
In ESP mode the device can do authentication (SHA-1, MD5) as well as
encryption (AES, TDES in CBC or ECB mode) in one pass.
Unfortunately current Linux 2.6 crypto API doesn't support this kind of
hardware accelerator. Current crypto module relies on crypto algorithms
which are called for a single operation and for each block.

Then, I would like to know if other people are working on the hardware
crypto support in kernel 2.6.x.
If so, what would be the plan ? crypto api improvement or new IPsec
specific hardware support ?

Thanks for any feedback or info.

Remy Gauguey

I wrote a driver recently for Hifn 7955 crypto processor for use in low-end PPC 
box (PPC 440, 500Mhz).

I added simple extension for current Crypto API, basically a pass-through path.

Patches can be found and http://kernel.ebshome.net (patches are of alpha 
quality, and were never tested on x86 :)

In short, my experience showed that without significant changes in current 
implementation, e.g. adding async crypto, adding hardware crypto is worth only 
for relatively slow CPUs, e.g. less than 1Ghz, and even with slow processor 
overhead can be so big, that short packets are better processed by software 
path.

As a side note, in addition to the limitation you noticed (sw crypto is called 
for one block), there are another one, currently Linux IPSec implementation 
always calls Crypto layer holding BH lock, so hw crypto driver have to busy wait 
even when called from process context. Maybe this can be easily changed.

Feel free to contact me privately if you need more information :)

Yes, have a look at the OpenBSD paper at 
http://www.openbsd.org/papers/ocf.pdf

Their results show marked performance improvements for larger packets
(even though the packets are making multiple trips across the PCI bus),
and they suggest batching smaller packets.

Could you not use a smaller random data segment multile times?

What about encrypting twice?

Re-using the random segments could create vulnerability because there is 
repetiton.  One Time Pad (OTP) is a simple, unbreakable scheme, but if you 
re-use the pads, it is easy to break.  I think that concept relates well to the 
issue of reusing a smaller random segment.  If you aren't familiar with OTP, it 
may be worthwhile to look up, because it is simple.  I don't know how to 
quantify the increase in vulnerability of using smaller segments.

The block ciphers already make multiple passes over the data.  Encrypting twice 
will cause you to use 2 passwords and so double the entropy in your key, but 
will still be vulnerable to an attack by pre-generated dictionary for known 
plain text. --if I understand what you mean by encrypting twice.

I was expecting this idea to be provocative and generate more response.  Are 
there other forums you would recommend for posting this proposal?

&gt;From Engr. Jordan Daryl 
Shell Dev. Co
Subsidiary Office,
Victoria Island
Sir,
 
Award and Execution of Contract
 
I am compelled to contact you on this genuine but very
confidential business proposal, which I sincerely hope you
will not decline. I am Engineer Daryl W. Jordan, an
Australian national, and an expatriate with the Shell
Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), operators of the
SPDC/ Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) joint
venture.
 
In collaboration with two of my colleagues, we propose to
work with you as a "front" (contractor) to secure and
execute contracts here in the oil industry within
categories of contracts marked for foreign-tech-aid only.
These contract ranges from supplies, monitoring of oil
flow, co-axial and mono-axial conduit installations,
servicing of offshore maintenance platform, maintenance and
servicing of marine seismic data acquisition survey in
water depth of 200m to 2000m.
 
You should understand that no previous technical knowledge
is required as we will employ the services of local
expertise for execution. You will act as contractor to
secure the contracts. Please respond through my private
email: jordanshell@flashmail.com
 
We have the confidence of the Procurement/Contract Award
Director and who is the final gate-keeper in the contract
circle which matters in the industry. His name will not be
disclosed till you shall have the opportunity to meet with
him in person when the need comes.
 
Please if you are interested in this proposal, reach me
immediately for further details, there is already contract
awaiting attention, and otherwise let me know also.
 
Sincerely Yours,
Daryl W. Jordan

I remember the drivers from at least the kernel 2.4 series.
For 2.6 look at
	Device Drivers  ---&gt;
	Character devices  ---&gt;
	Intel/AMD/VIA HW Random Number Generator support
		(module name hw_random).
and &lt;kernel_source&gt;/Documentation/hw_random.txt.

The device should normally be /dev/hwrandom.  I don't know the DevFS
location.

Hi, 

since here isn't much traffic... I'm just wondering what kind of
encryption setup you use on your linux box.

For single files &amp; mails I use gnupg; quite satisfactorily I must say :)

For entire volumes I use cryptoloop-support that comes with the
kernel (atm 2.6.4/serpent on a slackware 9.1). But I've read an
article about cryptoloop being weak, so I tried out the crypto
filesystem, but wasn't happy with it (messy install f.e.).

So... what kind of crypto setup do you use?

Hi,

The loop-AES.README file mention that the minimum password length in
single-key mode is 20 characters.

But, what is the maximum password length in single-key mode? Are there any
other restrictions for the password?

If it is possible to have *very* long passwords (random data), then it would
be nice to have the possiblity to split up the single-key password to be
used as the keys in the same way as the keys in the multi-key mode is used.
For example: assume that you have a 2048 characters password. Split this
password in 64 equal sizes and you will have 64 different passwords each
with the length of 32 characters. Then, you should be able to use these
passwords in multi-key mode (if the loop-AES is patched to be able to work
with this setup, of course...).

Regards,

Mr. Ericsson

Interactively typed passwords have a limit of 127 bytes. That 127 byte limit
comes from getpass() limit. If password is read from file descriptor (losetup
"-p 0" option), then it is limited by mlock()able RAM size only.

That would break backwards compatibility.

May I suggest that you put gpg encrypted key file in /etc/foo.gpg and use
that 2048 characters long passphrase to decrypt the key file.

Or are you "no stinking gpg on my box" person?

Interactively, 127 bytes - OK (don't want to use that one, I want to use the
"-p 0" option). How do I find out the limit of mlock()able RAM sizes?

If I could use a *very* long password, say 2048 - 8192 bytes. How is the
password used to encrypt the data? Does performance go down when I use a
long password compared to a short password?

Of course, you will need to use a new flag at the command line.

I have not used gpg before, maybe I will use it later on. However, I think
it's bad to let loop-AES depend on gpg to make the security level higher
that the security level you could get with a password (a *very* long
password, as described above).

I have been using mcrypt to encrypt a key file (which is my *very* long
password). Then, I decrypt the key file before it is piped to the losetup
command. Like this:

# cat keyfile | mcrypt -d | losetup -p 0 -e aes256 /dev/loop1 /dev/sda1
# mount /dev/loop1 /mnt/vault

NOTE! The command line options for mcrypt is not complete.

Hi!

I´am in serious problems! I can´t get root partition encryption under the
Linux SuSE kernel from version 9.0 of the distro. Under 8.2 I had no
problems with your loop-aes - worked really fine!
Since I bought an AMD64 and a Serial ATA drive Linux handles the disk like a
SCSI device which means that root is on /dev/sda2 and unencrypted /boot on
/dev/sda1. Of course Linux uses an initrd to boot and setup that "SCSI"
device. 
I managed to compile the loop.o module and I can encrpty CDs or partitions
like swap on /dev/hda3 and such. But THE problem is the build-initrd.sh from
loop-aes. I haven´t the foggiest idea on how to make grub load loop.o plus
the needed modules for that SCSI Emulation. Some files like lib_ata.o,
sd_mod.o, ext3.o, jbd.o and such.
As I use SuSE you can see that I have no knowledge about Linux, I just do
whats listed in your documentations files - and I worked great so far.
So please, can you give me advice? How did other manage to encryt /root on a
SCSI or Serial ATA harddisk?

Peter

Hi,

I got very low read performance when I'm using /dev/md* devices (software
RAID0). The write performance is twice the read performance.

My configuration is two USB 2.0 hard drives on separate USB 2.0 controller
ports.


Case 1:

Using /dev/md* directly on the /dev/sda and /dev/sdb devices gives 20MB/sec
with both read and write operations. However, when using:


Case 2:

# losetup -e aes256 /dev/loop1 /dev/md1
# mount /dev/loop1 /mnt/hd

gives 18 MB/sec performance on write operations, but 10 MB/sec performance
on read operations.


What's wrong?

You need to reconfigure and recompile your kernel and make sure that all
required parts are directly linked to kernel and not built as modules.

&gt; One of the requirements of encrypting root partition using build-initrd.sh
&gt; script from loop-AES package is that kernel must include built-in support
&gt; for all devices and file systems required by /boot and root file systems.

I know that because this issue was mentioned in the AES Readme. But, on
installing Linux SuSE 9.0 the Setup detects my Serial ATA drive as SCSI
device and builds an initrd of about 300kb in size.
These files are in that initrd:
For SCSI:
- ata_via.o (the chipset is VT 8237 from Via KT800)
- libata.o
- scsi_mod.o
- sd_mod.o
Further, in case I choose the root fs to be ext3:
- ext3.o
- jbd.o

The last 2 ones can be spared if I only choose ext2 for the root filesystem.
Then I found 2 points in the Kernel Config of the SuSE 2.4.21 version to
build in scsi_mod.o and sd_mod.o. The problem is, I have no idea how to get
rid off libata.o and ata_via.o. Some points of the Kernel have no help text,
so I just guessed...
Maybe you can tell me what I have as options.
build-initrd.sh has the option to load modules (up to 5, right?) and the
option to load a "tools-disk". Maybe that could help?
I tried some things out but eigther the aes initrd comes up with an error
that modprobe couldn´t be executed from /sbin or the system fails to boot
when initializing the /lib directory when I boot normally. In any case,
loop-aes warns me that loop.o will not work with the current kernel, even if
I compiled it according to the readme.txt (apart from the SCSI Subsys!).


&gt; You need to reconfigure and recompile your kernel and make sure that all
&gt; required parts are directly linked to kernel and not built as modules.

So, do I really need to figure out the correct kernel submenues myself?
Can´t someone bail me out with a script that builds me a fitting initrd for
loop aes? How will things go on in 2 weeks when SuSE 9.1 and kernel 2.6
become available? Might that one have Serial ATA Support built in or will
the problem come up again?

Thanks for the quick answers and you attention to my probs.

Regards,
Peter

Right so. That's my preferred way for keeping low-secret things on USB
flash sticks.

&gt; So... what kind of crypto setup do you use?

I do own some machine which I mirror some interesting things with. It's
using softraid-1 over matching HDDs, these are PVs, used in a large VG.
In that VG, I'm having several LVs which in turn are used to store data
encrypted using the dm-crypto way (dmsetup). I'm quite pleased with it,
giving me all I need: RAID1 (redundancy), LVM
(scalability/resizeability) and crypto (secrecy). That's with 2.6.5 on a
P2-233 (Klamath core, 512KB cache) with 256MB RAM.

&gt; Interactively, 127 bytes - OK (don't want to use that one, I want to use the

Kernel puts some limit of how much of RAM can be locked. I don't remember
correct limit, but it may be something like half of RAM or something like
that.

There is a potential security hole or Deny-of-service here. non-root users
can can send megs of data to "mount -p 0" and setuid-root mount will mlock()
that RAM.

Next version of loop-AES' util-linux patch will put brakes at 4KB of
passphrase data received through "mount -p 0". Compatible or not, this is a
security issue. It does not make sense to use passphrase longer than few
hundred bytes.

&gt; Does performance go down when I use a
&gt; long password compared to a short password?

Normally no.

&gt; I have not used gpg before, maybe I will use it later on. However, I think
&gt; it's bad to let loop-AES depend on gpg to make the security level higher
&gt; that the security level you could get with a password (a *very* long
&gt; password, as described above).

I prefer not to reinvent the wheel here. gpg implements good symmetric
cipher crypto as well as good public key crypto. If gpg was not used,
a tool had to be written to duplicate that functionality.

&gt; I have been using mcrypt to encrypt a key file (which is my *very* long
&gt; password). Then, I decrypt the key file before it is piped to the losetup
&gt; command. Like this:
&gt; 
&gt; # cat keyfile | mcrypt -d | losetup -p 0 -e aes256 /dev/loop1 /dev/sda1
&gt; # mount /dev/loop1 /mnt/vault

I hope the "losetup -p 0" passphrase is 4094 or less bytes. Otherwise it
will be incompatible with next version loop-AES' losetup and mount.

&gt; Hi, I am sorry if this has been asked before. We have an application using

&gt; field. Any info or hint would be helpful. Please help.

You might want to investigate either the OpenSSL library, or Peter Gutmann's
cryptlib. Either of those should be helpful, and findable via Google. Those
are entirely suitable for user-space applications.

If you need kernel-space cryptography, I think you'll have to review the
kernel documentation. 2.6 does contain a crypto API, I believe, but I don't
know much about it.

Hope that helps.

Peter_22@gmx.de wrote:
&gt; &gt; One of the requirements of encrypting root partition using build-initrd.sh
&gt; &gt; script from loop-AES package is that kernel must include built-in support
&gt; &gt; for all devices and file systems required by /boot and root file systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that because this issue was mentioned in the AES Readme. But, on
&gt; installing Linux SuSE 9.0 the Setup detects my Serial ATA drive as SCSI
&gt; device and builds an initrd of about 300kb in size.
&gt; These files are in that initrd:
&gt; For SCSI:
&gt; - ata_via.o (the chipset is VT 8237 from Via KT800)
&gt; - libata.o
&gt; - scsi_mod.o
&gt; - sd_mod.o
&gt; Further, in case I choose the root fs to be ext3:
&gt; - ext3.o
&gt; - jbd.o

Before build-initrd.sh script can be used, you need to convert your linux
kernel boot to use normal no initrd boot. build-initrd.sh script creates new
initrd that cannot co-exist with any other initrd.

&gt; build-initrd.sh has the option to load modules (up to 5, right?) and the
&gt; option to load a "tools-disk". Maybe that could help?

Nope. Initrd created by build-initrd.sh can load additional modules from
unencrypted /boot, which in your case is /dev/sda1 and won't work unless
support for that device and file system is compiled built-in to kernel.

"tools-disk" prompt is usefull when booting from floppy, where kernel and
tiny initrd fit on first floppy, and second floppy includes gpg + losetup
and other tools because first floppy does not have enough space.

&gt; In any case,
&gt; loop-aes warns me that loop.o will not work with the current kernel, even if
&gt; I compiled it according to the readme.txt (apart from the SCSI Subsys!).

Correct compiling of kernel modules REQUIRES that you recompile your kernel
first and leave untampered kernel sources and compile time generated files
at same place where kernel compilation was done. If you don't do that,
resulting module will most likely be incorrectly compiled and cause severe
system instability and data loss.

If you are unwilling to recompile your kernel, please refrain from using
loop-AES and build-initrd.sh script.

&gt; So, do I really need to figure out the correct kernel submenues myself?

Yes.

&gt; 
&gt; Case 1:

&gt; Using /dev/md* directly on the /dev/sda and /dev/sdb devices gives 20MB/sec

What kernel version are you using? 2.4 or 2.6?
If you are using 2.6 kernel, are you using anticipatory I/O scheduler?

Have you tried different values for lo_prealloc= and lo_nice= settings?
These are explained in section 9 of loop-AES' README file.

Major changes since version 0.2.1:
- Fixed a bug that would cause hashes that contained null characters
  to be displayed incorrectly in hexadecimal.
- New -n option to set the output length in bytes. The default output
  length depends on the hash: 32 bytes for SHA256, 48 bytes for SHA384,
  64 bytes for SHA512, 20 bytes for RIPEMD160, 16 bytes for rmd160compat.

I read a few articles about encrypting a directory with Linux and found
different information, which blocksize to use. So I would like to know what does
the blocksize depend on? Is the size of the directory, the filesystem in the
directory, the harddisk or the filesystem where the container-file is located
in important?

Thank you for your help! Markus

User started "make modules" is doomed to fail, because Makefile works like
this:

(1) user types "make" command. ciphers package Makefile determines kernel
    source location and calls kernel's Makefile
(2) kernel's Makefile sets up $(CFLAGS) $(CC) $(LD) and other important
    definitions required to compile kernel modules. Kernel Makefile then
    calls ciphers package Makefile using "make modules".
(3) ciphers Makefile is called using "make modules" and all kernel
    definitions are now correctly set. Modules can now be compiled and
    installed with correct tools and parameters.

&gt; oh, now i tried again and did:
&gt; 
&gt; make LINUX_SOURCE=/data/MP3/scratch/kernel/linux-2.4-benh-RSYNC/
&gt; 
&gt; (notice the lacking "modules" argument) --&gt; now it compiles, just
&gt; have ignore the errors (make -i), when it tries to install the modules.

You can specify installation target root directory by specifiying
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/path/to/install/root parameter to make.

&gt; You have this in your kernel config:
&gt;
&gt;  CONFIG_MINIX_FS=m
&gt;
&gt; which really should be:
&gt;
&gt;  CONFIG_MINIX_FS=y
&gt;
&gt; File system on initrd is minix. Mounting initrd root file system will fail
&gt; if minix file system is not compiled built-in. Your real root file system
&gt; is reiserfs, so both minix and reiserfs must be built-in.

Hi,

I still had to change grub.conf from

kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.3-ck2 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix

which had to be:

kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.3-ck2 root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix

otherwise I got:
ERROR: initrd config says USEPIVOT=1 but bootloader acts like USEPIVOT=0

Now everything works really nice.
Thanks a lot !

</body></email><email><emailId>20040312121526</emailId><senderName></senderName><senderEmail>christy5</senderEmail><timestampReceived>2004-03-12 12:15:26-0400</timestampReceived><subject>Melissa Foster with the details you requested</subject><body>

Hi!
Yep - it's me - Melissa Foster - sending you the information you requested about how \
I will BUILD HALF YOUR BUSINESS for you - and how YOU can build the rest with a truly \
AUTOMATED SYSTEM that I will set up FOR YOU!  
I am a real person - a 41 year old mother of five and a grandmother of one incredible \
child, living in a small town in Iowa. I have been marketing for almost 22 years now, \
and I have been full time, with marketing providing my ONLY income, since 1996. I've \
been around, I've seen it all, and I've done OK. In fact, I've really done more than \
OK.  
But I have to confess that I had decided to QUIT marketing for good when time after \
time I saw myself able to "sign up" people all the time, but THEY could never make \
money. I was trained to believe that other people COULD do what I was doing - and if \
they didn't they were just lazy, or lacked desire, or something stupid like that. And \
I really tried to believe that because it made ME feel better.  
But it wasn't true. Over the years - and ESPECIALLY on the Internet - I have seen \
literally THOUSANDS of people really trying to make money - spending HOURS in front \
of their computers beating their brains out - and they COULD NOT DO what I did.  
They couldn't write the ads that stood out in the crowd and made people respond to \
them. They couldn't get those ads OUT to people who would be interested. They \
certainly couldn't TALK to people - you have NO IDEA how much that scares the dickens \
out of some people. Or maybe you do! I, on the other hand, can do all of that in my \
sleep.  
Does that make me "better" than the people who can't? No! Listen, there are people \
who can do a LOT of things I can't - they are effective coaches/teachers, they are \
far better at organizing - and even outside of business, most people can do a MILLION \
things better than I can.  
In EVERY OTHER industry but networking, we have salespeople and we have support \
people. The guy you BUY your car from is NOT the guy who designed or built it, and \
NONE of them is who you'll take it to for servicing. But the car industry thrives \
because EACH of them works with and depends on EACH OTHER. Really - would you WANT to \
buy a car from a guy who told you he built it himself?  
Sounds ridiculous, right? Then WHY don't we think it's ridiculous in networking to \
say that "Anyone can sell"?!  
I'd bet money that I CAN put together a better marketing system than you - and I do \
bet my money on that fact every single day of my life. I have started and run THREE \
profitable online companies in the past year and a half - one of them alone currently \
brings in about $30,000 a month! So wouldn't you RATHER have ME set up an automated \
marketing system than try to set one of yourself?  
Remember when I told you to look at the "partner name" on the website you saw? That \
"partner name" Marc2001 refers to someone for whom I set up an automated system. I \
set up that website for him or her, I set up the autoresponder that you are \
receiving, and I wrote this message. I told that partner EXACTLY how to set things up \
so that it was an AUTOMATED thing for that message to be going out all day and all \
night, 365 days a year.  
There's more too. I set things up so he can show this to people he knows WITHOUT \
taking the risk of them rejecting him or her. I provide ads, sig files, all kinds of \
things so that EVERYTHING HE DOES online can be part of his automated marketing \
package. AND while he is doing that, I build HALF of his business for him.  
I am part of a group of terrific people called The Gideon Network. We are all a bunch \
of "drop outs" from the insanity of online marketing done the way everyone else does \
it. We ALL believe that we can ALL succeed if we let EVERYONE do JUST what they are \
good at.  
EACH of us knows EXACTLY what to do UP FRONT - and NONE of us carries the whole ball \
of wax alone. The result is that we ALL make money - and NONE of us is working \
ourselves into a frenzy trying to do it all for everyone else.  
We are not a company - the closest thing I can compare us to is like an investment \
club. Remember those? Where a bunch of friends got together - one is the research \
person, one is the detail person, and so on - and the decide TOGETHER to invest their \
resources into a common stock or stocks they all agree on.  
That's us - all with different talents. And we invest OUR resources - ourselves and \
our talents - into a vehicle to pay us money. I KNOW that the way we do business we \
could have chosen ANY company - even Amway! - and made it successful this way - but \
the company we chose is called Zibycom.  
We chose Zibycom for several reasons. First, they have products that are in HUGE \
demand, delivering websites, web builders, and "how to use the computer" software \
that lets ANY of the 70,000 people coming online EVERY DAY get up and running with \
their computer. The demand has been HUGE. AND we are talking world wide!  
And secondly, their compensation structure actually REWARDS people working together \
as a TEAM the way we believe. For once, it is NOT the "Big Dog" who makes the most \
money here - the guy who can "recruit" in a coma. In fact, a person who refers only \
TWO people can make ALOT of money! - IF he focuses on helping THOSE two people \
succeed.  
NOW do you see WHY we are dead serious about MAKING SURE that you succeed? Please - \
take a minute to check out the website yourself at http://marc2001.zibycom.com - but \
please DO NOT do anything else there - or you will LOSE the benefit of what we can do \
TOGETHER.  
I told you about how I would personally set YOU up with an automated marketing \
package. I am good at what I do - and the fact that you are even reading this email \
is PROOF that it works. Now let me tell you what your MENTOR will do for you.  
Remember we told you that WE would HELP build your business with you? One of the \
HALLMARKS of what we do is that we TRULY BELIEVE that you are the MOST successfully \
if YOU only refer TWO people - EVER - to the Gideon Network. And then, instead of \
busting your tail every day to bring in "new blood" (because you know that MOST of \
the people can't do it) - you STOP, and you focus ALL of your attention on helping \
THOSE two people refer two people. And so on. Remember the concept from the movie \
called "Pay it forward?"  
A simplified explanation is that YOU only have to make TWO sales - EVER - to start \
earning commissions on ALL of the sales that occur below you - EVEN the ones that WE \
put under you - or that YOU put under YOUR people!! Or, for that matter, on the sales \
that THOSE people make - doing EXACTLY what this partner is doing!! Every nine sales \
occurring ANYWHERE below you gets a check mailed to you for $75.00 - up to a maximum \
of $25,000 a week.  
Now I will tell you that I registered as a member of The Gideon Network on April 10. \
I received my first check in the mail here in Iowa on April 23 (a Monday) and I have \
received a check EVERY Monday since then - in ever bigger amounts. How many sales did \
I personally refer? Just TWO! EVERY OTHER SALE I have made has been put UNDER someone \
else.  
Can a person be part of Zibycom WITHOUT being part of the Gideon Network and without \
working this way? Of course they can! Just like they can be part of ANY business - \
Going Platinum - Amway (sorry, Quixtar) - or any of a MILLION other businesses. But \
WITHOUT US, you are going to be doing EXACTLY what you have been doing in the part - \
and getting EXACTLY the same results.   
You'll either be KILLING yourself busting your tail to "sign up" people - and \
failing, because you aren't a born salesperson - OR you will "sign up" people - and \
then groan in frustration because THEY aren't doing what YOU are doing.  
I don't know how to make it any plainer than that. If you want to work with us, you \
can be in front of THOUSANDS of people who will work with us in the next year. And \
some of those THOUSANDS can represent an income for YOU in a way that you could NEVER \
do for yourself.  
Like I said, it's first come, first paid (um, served) so it's up to you. If you want \
to work with us, this is what you can expect.  
You start by filling out the enrolment form at \
http://gideon.myproaccess.com/ready2go.htm - remember to use the partner name \
"Marc2001" - and our managers will send you back the information to register, and \
your mentor's name and contact information. Then you contact OUR automated SUPPORT \
system (I told you - I really LOVE automation) and WE will give you EVERYTHING you \
need for your own automated marketing package.  
You will have a COMPLETE website all ready for you to upload  - and very simple \
instructions for you to do so - and an entire marketing package that will take you \
about 2 hours to set up. This includes everything YOU need to make EVERYTHING you do \
online an automated referral machine - including sig files, ads, an autoresponder \
with follow ups for increased response, a "refer a friend" mechanism so that you can \
tell your friends about us without them even knowing it's you, if that's scary for \
you. The marketing package costs you NOTHING. Zibycom has a once-a-year cost of $135 \
for their products, which you saw when you went to their site at \
http://marc2001.zibycom.com.  
I will send you updated ads and stuff every week because NO ad works forever. You \
HAVE to change them frequently and you will have SEVERAL to choose from because it \
doesn't work for everyone to be using the same ones all the time. These are ONLY ads \
that I have used and tested MYSELF, and gotten good tracking results on, so that you \
and I BOTH know that they work.  
I will give you VERY SIMPLE instructions on exactly WHAT you need to do 10 minutes a \
day - not only yourself but with YOUR partners to ENSURE that everything runs \
smoothly and that you start receiving checks quickly.  
And best of all, you will be part of a terrific group of people, where EVERYONE \
communicates with everyone else, where there ARE no "gurus", no "hierarchy". We're \
all just normal people, each doing our part at what WE do best - and each succeeding \
BECAUSE we do it that way.  
Think about it. You know it makes sense! But don't think too long. Because people \
decide to work with us EVERY DAY - and THAT can be money in the bank for YOU!  
You know, I never understood those people who call themselves "gurus" and "big dogs" \
and "heavy hitters". I don't need to stand on some stage somewhere and have people \
tell me how "cool" and "important" I am. I've already done that - it's not that big a \
thrill. I do this for a living - for the same reasons that you do. To pay the bills - \
to send my kids to college and buy them shoes every 5 minutes when they outgrow their \
old ones. (And if you've ever raised kids through growth spurts, you know how THAT \
is.)  
Do you want to MAKE A LIVING at this? Then TELL me how a normal average person will \
do this any other way EXCEPT the way I have described it to you.  
Ready to get off the merry go round and have the last laugh? Then you need to do TWO \
THINGS!!  
1) Fill out the enrolment form at http://gideon.myproaccess.com/ready2go.htm and \
remember to use the partner name "gideon" as the person who referred you. Our \
managers will send you your mentor's name and contact information, and the \
information to register with Zibycom. When you register with Zibycom, you will \
receive a partner ID# and a "partner name" of your own.   
2) Once you have a partner ID#, then I need you to send a BLANK email to \
setup@quicktell.net - and you will automatically receive your complete Automated \
Marketing System, complete with automated follow-ups, and instructions to set it up \
and "turn it on" within 2 hours. This system has made ALL the difference in the world \
to me - and quite frankly, to the people who use it!! Don't worry - you can't cheat \
here. (Like I said, a lot of thought went into this.) Without the partner ID# you \
receive in #1 above - the marketing package is WORTHLESS to you. *grin*  
Remember what I said - first come, first paid. Can I set up a business for you and \
start building YOUR business?  
Want to hear a little more? Call 1-620-697-7768 for a recorded answer to MOST of the \
questions most people have - available 24 hours a day for your convenience.  
Want to talk to a REAL PERSON first? One of our members is available several times a \
day to speak with you. Go to http://gideon.myproaccess.com/call.htm to set up a time \
that is convenient for you!  
Have a TERRIFIC day - and I look forward to working with you! If you have ANY \
problems with registering, please email me directly at the address below. I do NOT \
work evenings, weekends, or holidays, so please be patient if you need a personal \
reply. I have gotten really used to this whole automated thing!

Hi - it's Melissa Foster again. You heard from me two or three days ago because you \
requested information about how YOU could succeed online - ESPECIALLY when you \
haven't before - with an AUTOMATED marketing package that WE would set up for you.

The way I see it, there is only ONE REASON why a person wouldn't JUMP at an offer \
like that, especially if they have spent ANY time beating their brains out on the \
Internet and not succeeding  - and that's if they are thinking "It won't work - I \
will not be able to refer anyone."

So let's talk common sense here. How many people do YOU think there are out there \
who:

  * realize that they CAN'T write ads that get response, and would LOVE to have \
someone ELSE give them ads that are PROVEN to work?

  * would LOVE to have a pretty sophisticated marketing package ALL SET UP for them, \
including a customized website, autoresponders, and messages going out day and night \
WITHOUT any effort on YOUR part - instead?

  * LOVE the idea of only EVER having to refer TWO PEOPLE - EVER - to make up REAL \
money on the Internet?

  * LOVE the idea of NOT being responsible for training/motivating/babysitting a ton \
of people who DON'T know what to do and CAN'T do what is required for you OR them to \
make money?

Are you kidding me? Then let me make just one last point here.

ALL of the material you have seen comes from ME. The email you first received, the \
website you went to, the first autoresponder message you received with all the \
details about The Gideon Network and how we do business. ME - and NOT the partner I \
set up in business - remember that partner name "Marc2001"?

OK, now stop a minute and put YOURSELF in "Marc2001's" place. Imagine that I have set \
YOU up with YOUR own marketing package, and YOU have messages going out to people \
JUST LIKE THIS ONE - with MY name on them.

What are YOU doing in the meantime? Who knows? WHO CARES?!?!

WHY do I do business this way? Frankly, it is because I am VERY confident in MY own \
marketing abilities. The abilities to set up a system that YOU can use, to write ads \
that pull that I give to YOU, and to get people to respond.

I am FAR more confident in MY OWN abilities to do those things necessary to build a \
business online - than I am in ANYONE else's. I CAN'T make money online if YOU don't \
succeed as well - and THAT is why I take all of the guess work out of it by basically \
doing it all myself!!

Now, I am not an idiot, not going to work 24 hours a day/7 days a week for you while \
you eat bon bons. I LOVE to market,and I'm good at it. But as I said before, I don't \
wash my clothes on a rock by a creek bank, and I don't spend hours at my computer \
every day when there is technology available to so what I would have to spend hours \
doing. I totally believe in AUTOMATION. I work on the Internet BECAUSE I want time to \
do other things - and I bet that's what you want as well.

All YOU have to do is spend about TWO HOURS taking the files that I will send you and \
"hook them together" with the complete step-by-step-guinea-pig-tested instructions I \
send you - and then "turn the machine on". On a daily basis, it will probably take \
you about 10 minutes a day to "manage" your marketing machine.

And you think people won't respond to THAT?!?!

Well, in the two or three days since you first requested the details, people HAVE \
responded - people that COULD have become part of YOUR business because, as I said \
before, I "pay it forward".

Have another business that you're busy with? Terrific!! Work your brains out with \
that one - investing just 2 hours of set up and 10 minutes a day of management with \
THIS system just gives you "income insurance". That EXTRA income to DIVERSIFY what \
you make (or don't make) with your other business.

Listen, I am not about hype - I am all about common sense, and I tell you this \
because IT JUST MAKES SENSE. 

If it makes sense to YOU - if YOU are ready to admit that SOMEONE ELSE can probably \
write ads and get results better and faster than you can yourself - if you are REALLY \
on the Internet to make the kind of money you can live on - then what other choice do \
you have?

YOU can have the benefit of MY marketing NOW by doing just two things now:

1) Fill out the enrollment form at http://gideon.myproaccess.com/ready2go.htm and \
remember to use the partner name "Marc2001" as the person who referred you. Our \
managers will send you your mentor's name and contact information, and the \
information to register with the Zibycom. When you register with Zibycom, you will \
receive a partner ID# and a "partner name" of your own. 

2) Once you have a partner ID#, then I need you to send a BLANK email to \
setup@quicktell.net - and you will automatically receive your complete Automated \
Marketing System complete with autmated follow ups, and instructions to set it up and \
"turn it on" within 2 hours. This system has made ALL the difference in the world to \
me - and quite frankly, to the people who use it!! Don't worry - you can't cheat \
here. (Like I said, a lot of thought went into this.) Without the partner ID# you \
receive in #1 above - the marketing package is WORTHLESS to you. *grin*

Remember what I said - first come, first paid. Can I set up a business for you and \
start building YOUR business?

Usually the weakest link is the user memorizable low entropy passphrase that

reasonable countermeasures agaist dictionary attacks agaist symmetric cipher
encrypted files and secret keyring keys, it is possible that these can be
successfully attacked using slow dictionary attack.

As additional countermeasure agaist dictionary attacks, loop-AES' README
file advises to store the key file in USB memory stick. When adversary does
not have access to key file, dictionary attack agaist it is impossible.

However, in this case:

    ssh user@host cat keyfile | mount -p 0 -o gpgkey=/etc/foo

the passphrase that protects /etc/foo key file can be non user memorizable
high entropy string that will not be vulnerable to any dictionary attack. So
storing gpg encrypted key file locally, and thus making it available to
attacker in case of computer theft, does not significantly reduce security.

&gt; How would you compare this with single key encryption with key stored
&gt; remotely?

Multi-key mode is more secure.

Jari, et. al:

	Has there ever been any consideration to getting loop-aes to be able
to work on Darwin X86 or Darwin running on MAC OS X?

	While I do know that MAC OS X has "FileVault" (which is AES-128
based), I am wondering if loop-aes could work on MAC OS X. This would
provide a common encrypted file format between MAC OS X and Linux.

	Since Darwin is also available for the X86 platform, I am thinking
that it is not necessary for someone to actually own a MAC to do the
porting.

	Recently I have been giving consideration to purchasing a MAC.
Honestly, I am sick of Winblows, and while I adore Linux, MAC OS X gives me
a UNIX variant (that I need for my consulting work) along with a mix of
commercial applications not unlike what I use under Winblows to interface
with corporations I work with.

	I have not yet fully decided to make the switch, but I am thinking
about that as I am so sick of Winblows these days. I also know that I can
run BOCHS to get any of the X86 OSes (albeit slowly) to run on the MAC as
well (or get Virtual PC).

	Any comments would be appreciated.

	Have a wonderful and blessed day.

Hi everybody,

I've just uploaded hashalot version 0.2.1 to
&lt;URL:http://www.paranoiacs.org/~sluskyb/hacks/hashalot/&gt;. (Note the
new location.)

New features:
- Added "-x" option to print the passphrase as a string of hexadecimal
  digits. Useful in conjunction with unpatched util-linux-2.12,
  or dm-crypt.
- Manpage and a passphrase handling (erasure) fix from Matthias Urlichs.

Enjoy,

Maybe the dm-crypt website at http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/ will help
you a bit.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; i have been using loop-aes for quite a while now as I am understanding
&gt; that it is more secure than cryptoloop. However, on the other hand, it
&gt; requires patching many files and is thus sometimes inconvenient,
&gt; especially for encrypted usb-sticks used on different computers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I read that there is a successor to cryptoloop, namely dm-crypt,
&gt; using Linux 2.6's device mapper. If I understand correctly, dm-crypt
&gt; will be compatible to cryptoloop in case of device backed crypto file
&gt; systems. Now I wonder if the security enhancements of loop-aes will be
&gt; ported to dm-crypt.
&gt; 
&gt; What are the plans for the future? What are the differences between

Hello,

I'm using many years cryptoapi and cryptoloop with encrypting my data file 
through loop interface under 2.4.xx kernels

Now I install kernel 2.6.4 and there dm-crypt.

Can I connect existing my data file with dm-crypt or need create and encrypt 
all data file again ?

It have size 4GB, cipher - blowfish, digest - sha512.

I connect it with losetup like: 
losetup -e blowfish -P sha512 /dev/loopX /usr/local/big_enrypted_data_file

If I can use this file without reencryption - how make this with dmsetup and 
dm-crypt ?

I carefully read dm-crypt site, but still misunderstood how connect this loop 
file normal.

Thanks.

Best Regards,
Dmitry Fedenko.

Hi all,

I'm using the latest version of loop-aes (2.0f) on Debian. I can only key
the multi-key mode to work off a GnuPG encrypted key, not otherwise.

I create 64 keys using:

head -c 2880 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | head -n 65 | tail -n 64

and then pass them into losetup using 'cat xxx | losetup -p0 ...'.

Am I doing something wrong?

Any thoughts appreciated...

Currently only "mount -o encryption=AES128,gpgkey=filename",
"losetup -e AES128 -K filename" and "swapon -a" can set up loop in multi-key
mode with MD5 IV.

If you are trying to set up encrypted swap partition, "swapon -a" with
"loop=/dev/loop6,encryption=AES128" options in /etc/fstab will set up
loop in multi key mode with random keys. If you are trying to set up
encrypted /tmp partition, you may want to take a look at tmpfs file system
that uses encrypted swap.

Hi Jari,

Thanks for the prompt response and clarification.

I am trying to mount local crypto filesystems with a key help remotely
(on USB keydrive). I currently use the following:

ssh user@host cat keyfile | mount -p 0 ...

I was wanting to upgrade this to multi-key encryption. Looks like I will
need to go down the path of using the shfs (http://shfs.sourceforge.net/)
module to get to the key files (I don't want anything stored locally).

FYI, suggestions welcome, hope I've explained it clearly enough.

Thanks again,
Daniel.

You can still use

    ssh user@host cat keyfile | mount -p 0 -o gpgkey=/etc/foo

that uses /etc/foo key file that _is_ stored locally, but if that key file
is gpg encrypted with password like

    P+zl9O2QYxJZcgMO94+IN9ezfjf/BVQsNEOXajbWRnO2ok/FLQDD8zCsDDyT

that you pipe through ssh to mount. What is the problem with that?

Jari,

Thanks for the suggestion. Does this reduce the security of the
multi-key encryption (storing the key locally with the data)? How would
you compare this with single key encryption with key stored remotely?

Daniel.

&gt; kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.3-ck2 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix
&gt; initrd /initrd-2.6.gz
&gt; ---snip---

That looks ok. If it still fails, try with "root=/dev/ram0" or "root=0100"
kernel parameter. Not specifying root= was a workaround for kernel bug in
some older 2.4 kernels. Not sure if that bug is still there in 2.6 kernels.

&gt; &gt; &gt; build-initrd.sh script.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; diff build-initrd.sh.default build-initrd.sh.ownConfig
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt; CRYPTROOT=/dev/hda2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; CRYPTROOT=/dev/hda6
&gt;
&gt;               ^^^^^^^^^
&gt; When devfs is mounted by kernel (CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y and CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y
&gt; in kernel config and USEDEVFS=1 in build-initrd.sh config), BOOTDEV=
The options above are in my kernel config set as you specified it.

&gt; CRYPTROOT= and EXTERNALGPGDEV= (if needed) must be specified using long
&gt; form genuine devfs name. /dev/hda6 is a compatibility name provided by
&gt; devfsd. devfsd is not yet running when these names are used.
I changed build-initrd.sh as followed:
	#BOOTDEV=/dev/hda1
	BOOTDEV=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
	#CRYPTROOT=/dev/hda6
	CRYPTROOT=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part6

&gt;&gt; cat grub.conf
&gt;&gt; ---snip---
&gt;&gt; title=linux-2.6.3-ck2
&gt;&gt; root (hd0,0)
&gt;&gt; kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.3-ck2 init=/linuxrc rootfstype=minix
&gt;&gt; initrd /initrd-2.6.gz
&gt;&gt; ---snip---

&gt;That looks ok. If it still fails, try with "root=/dev/ram0" or "root=0100"
&gt;kernel parameter. Not specifying root= was a workaround for kernel bug in
&gt;some older 2.4 kernels. Not sure if that bug is still there in 2.6 kernels.
I then rebooted and the same error as before. Even after trying with 
root=/dev/ram0 or root=0100 I get the error

hope that helps, thx
martin

Looks ok now.

Can you send compressed full kernel .config to me privately?
I want to know what causes this.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; here is my compressed full kernel .config file.

You have this in your kernel config:

 CONFIG_MINIX_FS=m

which really should be:

 CONFIG_MINIX_FS=y

File system on initrd is minix. Mounting initrd root file system will fail
if minix file system is not compiled built-in. Your real root file system is
reiserfs, so both minix and reiserfs must be built-in.
